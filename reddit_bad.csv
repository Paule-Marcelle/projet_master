----

*Relationship*

I have been with Jack (25) for almost a year now. 

We work in the same building, different departments. 

Jack, at the start of our relationship, lived in a studio apartment with his best friend of 15 years, Sam. Sam is 24. They had a no ""hook up"" rule, because they didn't want to force the other out of the apartment, especially with their work schedules not being the same. Sam works nights, Jack works days. 

Fair enough. 

He stayed at my apartment twice a week and, as the lord said, ""It was good."" 

I was completely fine with the relationship, until I learned about Sandra. 

Sandra is *special* to Jack and Sam. She has know Jack for 20 years and Sam for 15. She can do no wrong, anything she says is hilarious, and was allowed to spent the night at their apartment. She even had her own cot shoved in a corner. They used it as the couch. 

When Jack finally moved into a real house, with three bedrooms, I was finally allowed to spend the night. Sandra was still over at the house all the time and used the guest bedroom to sleep in. 

She was pretty much is considered an honorary roommate before they moved in, but the moment they had an extra room, she was leaving her things there. And I was not allowed to touch any of it. I could not leave my own shampoo in the house because Sam got upset, like I was trying to move in. 

Sam owns most of the consoles. I have to ask to play them. He deleted the gaming slot I made for myself, yet Sandra has her own on all the consoles. She has her own personal controller, which I am not allowed to use. 

On the anniversary of her sister's death, Jack told me to be ""super kind."" As she was emotional and prone to snapping. I told her I was ""sorry about Susan"" and she snapped at me. She said, ""If I wanted the Temp to know I would have told you myself."" 

Another time, Sam bought food for ""everyone"" but forgot I was going to be there, so I ate a microwaved meal while everyone else had Chipotle. There were two burritos, but Sam said they were both for Sandra because ""she was working out."" Sandra didn't offer to let me have any. 

I have heard her mutter ""fucking Temp"" under her breathe to Sam before. 

*But it came to a head this past weekend.*

**On Thursday**, Jack and I went to Vegas. 

We had a great time. 

However, I had been talking to Jack about moving into the spare bedroom. I hate my roommates, we don't get along. I wanted to move in, to push our relationship to the next level. While we were in bed, I asked him if he had talked to Sam about it. 

He said not to worry about it. 

I said I did worry. 

He promised to talk to Sam on Sunday. 

**Then on Sunday** he said we had to leave at 5am so we could get home in time for the Game Night he had planned with Sam and Sandra. I was not invited. Only when I mentioned I thought we had the *whole* weekend together did he say I could *watch.* 

We got home at seven p.m. and the house was completely different. Before it had been rather spartan, with the basic furniture. Now it looked like someone had taken a lot of effort to make it look nice. And, I hate to admit it, it looked amazing. Everything was tastefully done. I figured, stupidly, Sam had gotten some new furniture since he had a raise. 

Nope. It was because Sandra moved in over the weekend. All the extra stuff belonged to her. 

Jack seemed upset, but not surprised. Sandra was sitting in the living room on *her* couch, watching *her* TV. It pissed me off because I am her friend's girlfriend, she should want to acknowledge me at the very least. 

So while Sam and Jack *talked* I sat down. I tried to be civil. I asked where all the stuff came from and she just said, ""I moved out of my old house and into here. They didn't have a lot of shit, so Sam said I could just do whatever I wanted to the house."" 

""Jack seemed surprised."" 

""It was supposed to be next weekend,"" was all she said. She sounded angry I was even talking to her. ""Is that a *problem?*"" 

I told her it kind of was, she had an attitude with me, and I had asked Sam about moving in. I said I was hurt Sam lied to me. 

She just smirked and said, ""Did you think they would let you move in. Nice thought, never going to happen."" 

""I am dating your friend, you should be more respectful."" 

""I fucked him first, so its not anything special. He fucks a lot of people."" 

Then she turned on her game and ignored me. 

I called her bitch and went to find Jack. 

I told Jack about what Sandra said and he shrugged. He told me, ""Well, she is sort of right. We have only been together for 12 months, its not like we are engaged. I know you're upset, but when the time is right we will see about moving in together."" 

I told him I was furious. 

He cuddled with me and told Sam and Sandra he was going to skip out on the games for *right now* so we could bond. We had sex. He said he wanted to be with me, no I love you. Then he put on his clothes and went down to play games. 

I followed and he asked to talk to Sandra in private. Sam seemed amused and told me that I was causing a ""lot of problems in the house."" 

I told him I was kind of hurt he didn't just tell me I wasn't going to move in. He seemed surprised. He told me, ""I said, I would think about it. When I didn't mention it again to you I thought you understood. Sandra has been looking for a place for a while. She always comes first."" 

After Jack was done talking to Sandra, I asked to use his computer. He said sure and signed me onto the GUEST. I knew his password and went on his. I was bad and read his messages. His Skype was signed in and there were chats between Sandra and Jack.  

There was a lot of mention about ""the good times"" they used to have. Nothing explicit, just sharing memories from high school. They didn't message a lot, maybe twice a week. But Jack shared his problems about me with her and she talked about how great fucking Sam was. She said, ""It is prolly better than you. ;) Even though you were pretty good."" They never talked about hooking up, other than to make petty shots at each other. 

""Well, Canry is better as bj than you ever were, so fuck off."" 

""Sam knows how to eat a taco. You were like a limp noodle.""  

I searched for my name and two weeks ago, Sandra was asking if I was ever going to stop trying to move in. 

Jack said, ""She keeps pressing me. I feel caught."" 

Sandra said, ""Who moves in after 11 months? What does she think is going to happen? You get married? We dated for two years and didn't even say we loved one another until year two. She seems to think this is going to end in marriage."" 

Jack just wrote ""LOL."" 

I checked the latest messages with Sam and they seemed to be on the same line. Sam would ask questions about what Sandra liked in bed and Jack was very open, but not very excited about it. It wasn't very detailed, just ""try to touch here"" or ""do this a lot."" 

Sam was even less of a chatter, he would only message Jack when he wanted him to do something or they were gaming together. But Sam did send Jack a message from three weeks ago saying, ""I don't want Canry to move in."" 

Jack agreed and said he didn't think he wanted to live with me, if ever. ""I just don't feel ready, she is taking it too fast. She keeps pushing for it and I am tired of talking about it."" 

Sam told him, *told* him about Sandra needed a place to live and Jack said, ""Of course. She is always welcome."" But I am not. 

I love Jack and want to be with him. But... do I have a right to be upset? 

Sandra hates me, is there a way to fix this? 

From what Jack has said, Sandra has never had a problem with any other girlfriend. There are pictures of Sandra and several of Jack's exes in his Facebook albums. Jack's last ex lasted three years and I still hear about Sandra and Megan hanging out all the time.

Sam and Sandra are together. Jack dated Sandra when they were 15 to 17, though I think they hooked up for a few years after. But Sam and Sandra are always latching faces and Sam implied Sandra was quite the catch in bed. 

It makes me feel inadequate because Jack mentioned us having sex once to Sam and it was, ""Sorry, have to go please the woman.""  

All Jack ever says when he mentions me to Sam and Sandra is, ""Canry and I are going to the movies. Canry and I are going to her parents. Canry wants to go shopping, sorry can't play League tonight. Canry is trying to make me eat healthy."" There is never any passion about what is going on. But Sandra is mentioned so fondly it hurts. 

I have tried to FB friend Sandra, and she finally accepted, but I am blocked from seeing anything. All I can do is tag her. This drives me nuts. Am I in the wrong? What is the matter with Sandra? Why doesn't she like me?

My wife (30F) admitted to a drunken one night stand last weekend and it has turned me (32M) into a robot,"
I (32M) have been married to my wife Kate (30F) for 4 years, together for 9. Our relationship has been amazing, loving and supportive. We have good communication, hardly ever argue and our bedroom life has gone from strength to strength over the years. We discussed cheating in the past and I was always clear that we would be over if it ever happened.

Kate went home to visit her family last weekend which was fairly normal. Before she left on the Friday night, we had a minor argument about keeping the house tidy so our communication was limited on Saturday but I knew she was going out to meet some friends at a bar. I trusted her 100% so didn't think anything of it. 

Before I fell asleep, I text her saying that I hope she had a nice night. When I woke up on Sunday morning I had a missed call from Kate at 4 am so I immediately called her to check if she was okay but no answer. After a few hours I tried again a few times but still no answer. Around an hour later I got a message saying she was fine and was driving back soon. 

Kate got home late afternoon and looked awful. She had clearly been crying, was not wearing any makeup (unusual for her) and looked like a shell of a person.

I knew right away something was wrong but she wouldn't let me hug her and would barely speak. I sat her down on the couch and made her some tea. I gently encouraged her to tell me what was wrong and she burst into uncontrollable tears for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to comfort her.

She then proceeded to tell me, stopping every few words, that she had slept with someone last night after the bar. 

At that moment, something in my brain broke. I can't describe it any other way. I immediately got up and jumped in my car and drove off. I went to a park and walked around it for about an hour. Kate was calling my phone constantly and I turned it off.

When I got home, I grabbed two suitcases from the garage and went to our bedroom. I threw some of Kate's clothes and shoes into them and left them by the front door.

Kate was lying on the floor in the living room, curled up into a ball sobbing. I called her best friend who lives nearby and told her that Kate needed a place to stay and a ride to her place and that Kate could explain everything to her later.

I told Kate I was leaving for an hour and that her friend was coming to pick her up. She grabbed on to my legs trying to stop me from leaving. When I returned home again, Kate was gone and so were the cases.

On Monday, with a clearer head, I answered one of Kate's many calls and told her that I needed her to send me an email with as much details as possible of that night and if she leaves anything out, there will be no hope of reconciliation. I received this email on Monday night but still haven't opened it.

Since then, everyone has been trying to contact me but I have just been working, exercising and sleeping. One of her friends turned up at my house with an attitude demanding an explanation, I told her to speak to Kate and closed the door in her face.

I have also been speaking to divorce lawyers, have moved money into separate accounts and blocked Kate and all of her friends on everything.

Everything I have done since I found out seems like I have been on autopilot. I don't feel angry, upset or overly emotional. Just numb.

Kate posted a note through the door yesterday asking me to meet tomorrow but I'm conflicted.

Should I meet her? Will it change anything? Is there any point in trying to reconcile?

Is it normal to feel like a robot and how do I snap out of this?

Edit: I just want to add that when I came home the first time, Kate confirmed it was consensual. She was drunk but knew what she was doing.

"My (30f) boyfriend's (28m) grandmother (80sf) texted me asking for me to ""encourage"" my boyfriend to do something that makes him deeply uncomfortable. How do I reply without rocking the boat?","You can look at my post history for context, but there's a family event coming up on Sunday that my boyfriend has no intentions of attending because his violent, abusive twin would be there, and they are not on speaking terms. Although neither my boyfriend's mom or grandma will be there, there will be relatives in attendance who are not aware of his twin's felony conviction or the bad blood between my boyfriend, myself, and his twin because of the twin's behavior towards me.

After my boyfriend spent three days straight telling his grandparents and mother in texts and phone calls that he feels uncomfortable attending and will not go, today I received a text from his grandmother:

""Hi, I know things are not good with twin and you and boyfriend. Going forward I hope it will get better. Boyfriend's aunt and cousins will be getting together on Sunday in NYC. It has been over a year since they have seen each other and there is lots to catch up on. I'm asking you to encourage boyfriend to join them.""

Unbeknownst to her, I have told my boyfriend that he should go if he wants to, and he has told me repeatedly that he does not want to. He feels very uncomfortable and is still very angry around his twin, who still has not and refuses to apologize for the way he's treated us both. So now I do not feel like pushing the issue because I don't believe people should do things that make them unhappy.What do I tell her without rocking the boat?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and his twin are not on speaking terms. It is so bad that they can't be in the same room without yelling. He does not want to attend a family get together because of his twin. Now his grandmother is pressuring me to encourage him to go and I don't think it's right. What do I tell her?",1708189689.0,throwawayballethey,relationships
I (40F) don't know how to encourage my daughter (15F) to exercise.,"My daughter has always been quiet.  She's never had more than one or two friends at a time, and the friendships never really lasted.  From what I know it's not because they have fall-outs or anything, but because the other girls get bored of her.  My daughter's the type that speaks when spoken to, she's been like this ever since she was little.

She's never liked playing with other kids, or playing in general.  As a kid she used to sneak away from recess to read inside.  I'm bookish too so I never really saw that as an issue.  

I recently heard from her high school gym teacher, who is also a family friend, that she's really struggling in gym class.  My daughter isn't a thin girl, but she's not particularly overweight either.  We eat healthy at home, but there's no culture of exercise.
Her older sister is rail thin and honestly doesn't have the time to exercise (between school and theater commitments she sleeps maybe 5-6 hours a night), I'm obese but am losing weight (I currently go on walks every night but my daughter won't join me), and my husband (married 20 years) plays sports every now and then (daughter abhors team activities, always has).

Recently we just went for a walk around the city and my daughter got out of breath rather quickly.  Even though I'm much heavier than her, I wasn't tired at all, so I was rather concerned.  I just don't know what to do about this.  Should I leave it alone and let her make her own decisions?  Should I encourage her?  Because she's so quiet I'm probably the only one who can talk to her about this, but I don't think she'll listen to me.

EDIT: I know the probability of her playing sports is slim to none, but I'm worried about her lack of extracurriculars.  Once she got to high school she ignored all the club options, so every day she stays home, does her homework, and keeps to herself.  With my oldest currently applying for colleges, I'm wondering how my younger daughter will measure up.
  
**tl;dr**: My daughter, though not overweight, is very out of shape to the point of quick fatigue but refuses to exercise.  I don't know how, or if, to encourage her.",1443628352.0,daughterissues2,relationships
"I (23f) really screwed up and broke up with my boyfriend (28m) on the encouragement of my sister (29f) because she didn't think he had a good enough job for me. Now she is trying to hook him up with her best friend (30f) And I don't know what to do, at all.","So if it isn't obvious from the title, I really really screwed up. Basically I was dating the greatest guy ever and was really in love with him and thought he was the best thing ever happened to me. The problem is, is that he's the manager at an oil  change place and that's really all he ever wants to do with his life. I was happy with it, he's very happy with it because he's very good at his job and he also has a group of employees and even customers that love him and he has probably the best performing shop in the state. My sister on the other hand always told me that I am swinging below my ability basically and that I should try to go for another Guy with a better job and more potential.

So I was very stupid and I listen to her and in June I broke up with my boyfriend it was devastating to me and I know it was devastating to him and I have tried several times to get him back but he says I heard him too much and it was a window into my soul that he didn't like looking through even though he loves me with all his heart.

 I am pretty much resolved myself that it's going to take me a long, long, long time to get over this and have pretty much excepted that I screwed up and the only time is going to heal it. So here's the part that really sucks my sister, the one who encouraged me to break up with him, is now actively trying to set up her best friend with my ex-boyfriend. She tells me it's just a coincidence and she thinks that they would be great for each other.      So the obvious question is if her best friend is good enough for my ex-boyfriend why was and I get enough for him? Well she tells me that it's because she could never let her sister end up with the oil change man but she doesn't have the same issues with her friend. I'm so brokenhearted over this that I can hardly even sleep at night, in fact I can't sleep at night because I feel so betrayed and I feel like such an idiot that I listen to her When it certainly seems she had this grand plan all along.

 I'm so brokenhearted it, I am so lost I'm so devastated I don't even know what to do. And now add this B trail in from my sister and I don't even feel like I can face the day most days. How do I handle my sister? How do I handle my ex-boyfriend, I mean is it his life and I should stay out of his business even though I know there was some weird shit going on with my sister and the girl who's trying to date him now? 

  ---

"I'm pregnant, and the guy I'm seeing is being not so supportive. He is pro-life (like a leader in Students For Life), but basically encouraging me to have an abortion. I'm so stressed, and scared, and don't know what to do. ","I'm 19f and he is 23m. We've been seeing each other for four months in like this vague not FWB but not Bf/Gf way. Its alright and we seem to be happy, so I haven't pushed it. He is pretty busy too, and I don't think in the place for a relationship. 

I don't want to get into it in too much detail, but the birth control method we were using failed, and I found out I'm pregnant a few days ago. I told him right after I found out, and he was kind of irritated and told me to make sure I was actually pregnant. So, I waited another day and after another positive test told him.

He starts to FREAK OUT. About how he can't have this right now, and how I lied to him about birth control. He said a lot of things, some of which I'm sure he regrets. He basically called me a whore (which I'm *not*... I've only slept with 3 guys ever), and said since we weren't dating he has no idea whose baby it could be. He hasn't told me have an abortion exactly, but he has made me feel like shit for being pregnant. 

Now this is the part that is confusing to me. When we first met, we met because he was friends with a very goody two shoes, republican friend of mine. They were in a few organizations together, and he is really strongly pro-Life. Like to the point where I've seen him get in hour long debates with friends of mine, and he can be pretty persuasive. He is in law school, and he is a really smart guy. I've always been kind of torn about it, but I would say I am more pro-life than pro-choice. 

I don't have many people I can to turn too who won't judge. He hasn't answered a single text in two days, and I don't know who to go to. I can't go to my family, and my friends wouldn't understand. They don't even know we've been sleeping together.

My (33F) boyfriend (36M) went to a festival without me and I can’t move past it. ,"**FINAL UPDATE - we are now in the process of separating and he will be moving out of the house we share.

My (33f) boyfriend (36m) went to a music festival without me, and I can’t get past it and want to end our 6 year relationship

Hi Redditors! First of all apologies for any issues with formatting as I’m on mobile.

So as the title suggests, my boyfriend of almost 6 years recently went to a festival without me. 
We have spoken throughout our relationship about wanting to go to this one together, as neither of us had ever been to that particular festival and would love to experience it together, but then he only arranged a ticket for himself, behind my back, and went without me.

The ticket purchasing was done through a girl that I’d never met, and this particular festival requires you to sign up, exchange registration details, and all that jazz, so it was pre-planned, months in advance that she would try and get him a ticket and he would try for her, but at no point did he also give her my registration details, which he’s had for our entire relationship, or discuss this with me AT ALL.

He then proceeded to hide the above from me, not mentioning that he had other people trying for a ticket for (only) him - and when the purchaser was successful (getting tickets for this particular UK festival is like winning a lottery) he then failed to mention that someone else had bought him his ticket, and allowed me to believe that he got through to the payment page and ‘panicked’ thus only securing one ticket… I was trying to buy tickets at the same time but couldn’t even load the page due to the volume of people trying for tickets.

Over the next ten or so months and particularly the week before the festival I was very upset about it and the closer to the festival it got the more upset I became, a few days before the festival I made him aware of how badly the whole situation has hurt my feelings, and he then came clean about how he secured his ticket, which made me feel even worse as it meant that he has essentially lied to me for months about it instead of just being honest. I was gobsmacked. 

Whilst he was at the festival I received flowers, and a postcard saying how bad he feels, and he has apologised since coming back, and apparently it's all good now…

Since his return from the festival, I have also found out that the two girls he went to the festival with slept in MY tent with him (in their own pods) and he did drugs with them the entire time (he doesn’t have his own tent so borrowed mine) for the whole weekend, and despite multiple discussions and conversations via phone and text through the time he was there, he failed to mention this to me, and i think thats super shady, but he's now upset that I don't trust him.

I feel so, so, so unbelievably angry, hurt, and quite honestly mugged the fuck off, and he is acting like everything is ok and fine and I’m finding myself incapable of even sleeping in the same bed as him.  This is not the first glaring instance of selfishness in our relationship, and I’m seriously considering calling it quits over this as I cannot seem to get past the bitterness and resentment that I’m currently feeling. I find myself constantly snapping at him, not wanting to talk to him, and pretty much avoiding him altogether. I’ve slept in the spare room since he got back, and I’m seriously considering ending the relationship over this.

I don’t mind him going to things without me, and we both regularly meet friends or attend nights out without each other present as we both believe and encourage that having our own lives and interests is healthy. However, the particular festival I am talking about has been on my bucket list forever, and for the entire six years of our relationship we have talked about experiencing it together. So I think I’m pretty justified in being hurt by all of this. 'Hurt' doesn't even begin to cover it tbh.

We’re attending a wedding in France in a week’s time, and I think once we’re home I need to deal with this; whatever that entails. I can’t continue to live like this. 

Basically, I’ve been made to feel that this isn’t really that big a deal and I’m being silly, so I thought I’d ask the Reddit hive mind for some advice and opinions. So, Reddit, how do I move past this? Do I want to? 

TLDR - how do I move past my boyfriend being dishonest about doing something alone, that we’d always planned to do together?  

**UPDATE** - thank you to (most) of you for the kind words and for your advice, opinions, and even the comments calling me an idiot - I’ll add any further updates as things progress, but it seems that the writing is on the wall here and I need to make some serious decisions in the next few days. I thought this one was for life, so I’m struggling to say the least. Updates to follow for those of you interested. Thanks again ❤️

Did I (33f) really do the wrong thing to my husband (37m)?,"TL;DR my husband is pissed I ordered champagne for our anniversary dinner. 

My husband and I were celebrating our 6 year wedding/14 years together anniversary tonight. We left work early and had a massage and facial. Everything was good. 

We then went to a local upscale steak place and we’re having a good time. I went to the bathroom and secretly asked the waiter to bring a bottle of veuve clicquot after we finished as a surprise. Context: he got me a bottle when we got engaged. Then we shared a bottle at our wedding. Now it’s a “should we grab a bottle?” every anniversary and holiday. I’m still the one who prefers champagne over him but I am associating it as a marker for special things for both of us. 

Right before the bottle came, he was asking if we should go somewhere else for one last drink. I saw the waiter coming and said, don’t be mad, I already planned for that: and he came and opened it. 

My husband then went on to berate me about how I should have known he would want to leave, that he only ever got the champagne for me, and that even though he liked it sometimes, I only ordered it for myself and not him. Instead of enjoying the rest of our night, we argued about it until we paid and left. And then the entire way home and now he’s sleeping in a different room. 

I really thought I was doing something kind based on nostalgia of our relationship and I really feel beaten up over this. But did I do the wrong thing?

EDIT: Update since last night—woke up this morning, still upset, and talked it through. Ultimately he apologized, saying that ""he shouldn't have said anything and was just being a brat."" We had been drinking some during dinner, so that definitely played into it. I slept on the couch for some of the night, but woke up and went to bed with him later. We're good now.

The long of it: He reiterated that in the moment, he was really ready to go (not to have sex, to go somewhere else and have a drink) and it felt like I had extended the evening for something that was focused on solely me and not him. (I asked him ""not to be mad"" because he had just mentioned wanting to leave when I saw the bottle coming out.) I recapped the times we had shared this champagne together for special occasions, that he always seemed to enjoy partaking, and I was just trying to celebrate US not ME. We were going to order dessert and the bottle came before we did that, so we could drink it during that. He also tends to rush dinners, and I wanted to use our anniversary as an opportunity to talk, connect, not have phones, and enjoy the rest of the evening. Especially if he was willing to go to another place and drink, it didn't seem like it should have been a big deal. 

After reading comments I even point blank asked him if he thinks I make things about myself and if it is a common thing, and he adamantly disagreed. (I'm a highly anxious people pleaser, tbh, and he knows this) 

The cost had nothing to do with it. We both make a good amount of money, and he often encourages me to be less frugal and spend more on us/myself. I manage the money and know how much we can afford and where the money goes.

He loves massages and gets them more than me. The day we wanted to get a massage, only one was available, and he prefers them while I am okay with either a massage or facial, so I gave him the massage to be kind to him. 

I guess the takeaway here is: Unless it is a surprise for just him vs. us, I should talk it out with him. I also realize I could have ordered it earlier in the meal, I just didn't think champagne and steak went together well, and thought dessert was better.",1696409508.0,woggie19,relationships

He then insisted he needed to know the next time I hooked up with someone. I told him no, that would make me uncomfortable and was inappropriate. He didn't let it go then said we could no longer be friends if I could not tell him this. So I cut ties and have not communicated with him since.

It's been about a month, I didn’t block him on my phone or social media because we have a lot of mutual friends and I didn’t want to create more drama than there was. I was sure he would leave me alone and he pretty much did. A lot happened to me in that month including my only grandparent passing away. We were very close and it’s been difficult. The funeral won’t be for a couple of weeks so I’m still dealing with it all. So I’m not really looking for more stress in my life at the moment. Well, he contacted me yesterday. When I ignored his text he sent me a facebook message that I didn’t read, the preview of it said something about wanting to know where we stood. The text said that I was an important friend to him and he hopes that I’ll forgive him soon. I got pretty angry at that text because it seems like he thinks I’m not talking to him because I haven’t forgiven him, not because he point blank ended our friendship over not being able to know about my personal life. 

I met up with a friend (we’ll call her Elle) to discuss what was going on (she’s a mutual friend of ours) who had been in contact with him. Apparently he’s not doing well. He’s always been an overly emotional person and according to Elle he’s “drowning” right now. He’s worried I’m no longer friends with him and that I do not want anything to do with him. I was having a hard time telling her nicely that that was exactly how it was. That I didn’t want anything to do with him and that he was the one who chose to no longer be friends. That he had destroyed every shred of trust I ever had in him.  She says he knows what he did was wrong and that he didn’t know why he acted that way, that he was really sorry and had been acting overly emotional. Elle said that he’s appeared to have changed a lot in the last month. I reiterated to her that I did not trust him anymore and that he was the one who made the decision to step away. To me it was like this: He made that threat because he either was being honest, and could not be friends if he didn’t know and in which case why should it be any different now? Or he was using that as a manipulation tactic to get me to do something he clearly knew I was uncomfortable with doing, and if that is the case then he is not someone I want around me. The real clincher is this though, I told her that I could not, would not, have a friend (especially a male friend) around me who did not respect when I said “NO”. And if he could not see why that was a big deal to me then his problem extended far past me.

She was sympathetic and totally understood. She was just relaying a message and wanted to stay as moderate as possible. I told her I did not want to create extra drama and was perfectly ok with our friends not taking sides in the matter. Honestly, I just want to put it behind me. I don’t want to feel responsible for his mental state (even though I am). I told her it was probably best if I didn’t contact him back as I would just say things that would hurt him more (honest things, but hard to hear) and that if I just dropped it all he would never change, that I had to stick up for myself. That he could prove he was different by never doing this to a person again. She understood but thought he needed to hear from me to help him feel better. The conversation more or less ended there.

So here’s the rub, should I contact him back? He really is trying to reach out, I don’t hold a grudge, I totally understand he was in an emotional state of mind and believe he is truly remorseful. On the other hand, I have been hurt badly by friends before and have learned to create boundaries and stick up for myself when people cross them. It has always been a difficult thing to cut a friend out of my life because they did not have respect for me but I usually end up better off for the most part because I can concentrate on the people who do matter and do care about me. If I were hosting an event and I invited all our mutual friends along I would invite him too, if I were going to something he was at I would be ok with that, but I do not want to be alone with him again and I do not think we’ll ever get back to being friends without a lot of time and changes. He’s not doing well though. I’ve seen him go through emotional turbulence before and it is not pretty, it’s made worse by a specific medical condition which he is being treated for.

What is my responsibility in this? Can I just continue my life and not deal, or is this something that affects me that I need to do something about? I already have more emotional drama in my life than I can handle at the moment and don’t know if I can take on the weight of someone else’s burden now. But I do feel like ignoring him online and text is mean and making things worse, although I think anything I do short of dropping everything (which I’m not keen on) will make things worse. Do I have options?

TL;DR - Friend demanded to know about my sex life, I refused, he threatened our friendship with it so I called his bluff and cut ties. I now find out he is in complete mental anguish over the event and wants me to forgive him. I believe I have to stay to my boundaries and stick up for myself.


Edit: Wow! I woke up this morning to find that this blew up! I have to go to work so I can't reply to everyone but I will read every comment. Thanks everyone for the help! Helps me confirm my idea to keep my boundaries and stay out of contact with him.

Edit 2: /u/WaldenStorm told me to read an article by Captain Awkward called “My friend group has a case of the Creepy Dude."" it was brilliantly written and gave ne some real insight into the situation. Although I don't think this guy is as bad as the people in the article, I do believe if I somehow allowed this behaviour to be ok I would perpetuate this culture where that kind of thing is ok, and he could possibly be a worse person over time because of it. I highly reccomend the article, it is a facinating read.

Husband [35 M] is finding it hard to encourage me [32 F] to get a good job because he doesn't want me to make more.,"Long story short I am college educated in a high paying industry. My husband is brilliant but self taught and never wanted to go to school. Right out of college I made more than he ever had even with years of experience. I'm 7 years in and still make more. He used to pay bills while I went to school and I have paid them since graduating since I make more. He got a nice car and I put a down payment on a house. He buys all entertainment stuff like eating out, alcohol, movies, etc... I pay bills and buy groceries. It's fair in my eyes, ESP considering he's chipped in to pay our mortgage down in half the time. Yay! 

Well my dream team got entirely shut down and I lost my very niche job. We have 6 months savings and I got 3 months severance. I'm struggling to find another position and will likely take a pay cut. Obviously that makes me upset because I loved my job and worked my ass off with scholarships and loans to put myself through school, not even him put one penny into it. I did that to make good money and enjoy my job obviously. After graduating I offered to pay for him to go to school or start his own business or whatever he wanted to do to pursue his dreams, he declined and hasn't made an effort 

Well he's been putting down my ideas and interview blurbs I'm practicing with him. Everything is, ""well that's not realistic, you can't say that, that's a dream and silly"". It took a friend telling me how unique some of what I was saying was and how great it would sound in an interview to make me realize the complete tear down I get at home. I'm being told daily my ego is in the way and I need to just accept any job I can get. Well yes obviously if I get an offer and have nothing else I will. I'm not even at offer stage yet though because I'm bombing technical interviews and have no confidence. He thinks I'm ""not a natural"" at this and maybe should try something else and I feel like a failure and like he's right. 

I've got 6+ first round interviews lined up with big name companies where I'd be making bank if I landed one. He's just bitter and angry so I confronted him about and asked why it seems like he wants me to fail and that it's really affecting me. 

He told me he is bitter that I will always make more and doesn't want me to make more than him, he is finding it hard to encourage me to do well when it makes him feel like shit. 

Obviously this is a major issue and ridiculous because I gave him ample opportunities to go to school and get a degree in which he'd be making as much if not more than me and he had no interest in having to take gen eds and declined. 

However I still need to land a job and have confidence. We don't have insurance right now (was through my job) and can't see a counselor yet because I'm so busy studying to land a position and our marriage counselor is hundreds an hour. 

So what do I do with this in the meantime?? I will not limit my job choice because of male ego issues. But it's still psychologically impacting me so I've got to do something. This could be a sign I've out grown him and need to move on, but again not in a position to just up and leave, I have to at least land a job soon and it's hard to do that when I feel sabotaged by my husbands ego issues. 

**tl;dr: Went to college, husband didn't. Got laid off, trying to find work, husband admitted he is bitter and can't encourage me to do well because he doesn't want me to make more than him. Not sure how to handle but it's impacting me a lot psychologically.**",1492141127.0,jobsearchwoes,relationships
I (33f) need to explain to my coworker (30m) I don't want his company on the commute back home,"tl;dr I want help to explain to my coworker (30m) I don't want to commute with him from the office back home.

I (33f) have a coworker (30m) that lives in the general vicinity of where I live so we use the same public transport for 90% of the commute back from the office.

He tends to wait for me to finish work so we can catch the public transport and head home together and chat on the way home. That seems innocent enough, except for the fact I don't like it at all.

We just never have anything meaningful to talk about, we work on different things and can't even talk about work topics. Quite frankly I don't like him as a person, and don't enjoy his company at all. He's a know-it-all sarcastic dude who seems to patronize me and his comments at times could be borderline sexist.

I need advice on how to get him to understand I don't want to commute and spend time together without hurting the business relationship. I don't care for him as a person at all, but also I don't want to offend him and have him complain to HR and get me in trouble.

So far I've been making excuses each time to actually stay late at work under one pretext or another until he leaves and I can commute alone. I'd much rather travel alone with my headphones rather than with this dude. But I'm running out of excuses and would welcome your suggestions for a more permemant solution.",1688489684.0,Justkeepitanonymous,relationships
"How to encourage my depressed, video-game-addicted sibling to take action and move out of my house?","My brother 27M has been living with me 29F & my husband 31M for 2.5 years. He's dealt with depression since his teenage years. 3 years ago, he confided in our mom and let her know that he was at the end of his rope and might actually kill himself.  Since then, I've been keeping in touch with him and supporting him in whatever way I know how. When he dropped out of college at the end of the 2022 spring semester we invited him to stay with us since we had the space. My husband and I didn't set a deadline for when he'd have to move out and decided to play it by ear.

My goal in letting him stay with us is to provide a healthy, loving space where he has time to treat his depression without having to worry about bills, work, etc. Right now he has food stamps for his groceries and Medicare for health insurance. I pay for his phone bill and my husband and I split all other bills for the house between us two. I clean up after him in our shared spaces and have gotten pushback when trying to address that with him. 

While he's been living with us, his depression has been treated with ketamine infusions, TMS, psychotherapy, and medication. He checks in with me and lets me know how he's feeling. What I've observed is that he doesn't take advantage of the times where he's feeling good. No matter how he feels, better or worse, he uses all of his free time to play video games with his friends online. This really frustrates me. I've asked him about his excessive gaming and questioned its impact on his progress and he continues to describe it as either a coping mechanism for his depression or a way to simply fill his time. 

Several months ago, I kindly let him know that he needs to start working on a plan to move out and be independent. I've provided him with some local resources that aim to help those struggling with finding employment and integrating back into society. 

There's been some good things he's been doing lately. He's been good about picking up his medication on time and going to therapy. He consumes Healthy Gamer content from time to time. He also cleaned his room when he had to send his laptop in for repairs, but after a few days he resorted to playing games on his ipad while waiting for his PC to come back. 

He has his PC back now and still games constantly. He doesn't shower and it's hard to be around him for any period of time. My car is starting to stink because he uses it once a week  He talks about getting a job and wanting to help other people in his situation, but he doesn't take action. 

I'm in therapy and bring up this situation a lot. I'm reading How to Raise a Healthy Gamer to try to find some insight on how to proceed. I know video games are not inherently bad. At the same time I know his excessive gaming habit isn't going to be able to exist with a life in which he takes care of himself independently.   I know if I don't do something about this soon, it's going to come out in one way or another. My husband and I want our privacy and space back. 

I know I can't convince him to change -  he has to be willing to make the change for himself. I also have to take responsibility for the role I'm playing in this situation. I know I'm enabling him, but I'm afraid that threatening to take away anything I've provided to him will reverse the progress he's made. Still I can't continue to protect his feelings by pretending that everything is okay. It's going to eat me up inside and I need to listen to myself. I feel like he's taking everything that we're providing for granted.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What do you think I should do? Is tough love the only answer here? 

TD;LR: My depressed, videogame-addicted brother has lived with my husband and me free from bills, obligations or consequences for 2.5 years. 4 months ago, I let him know that he needs to figure out a plan on how to move out and be independent.

My (33F) partner (32M) is unhappy that I am encouraging my childrens involvement with their heritage,"Hey all 

i have 2 children from a previous relationship who are dual nationality (their father is from another country which is how they have obtained dual nationality) Kids are 10 and 9 

I have been with my partner for 6 years now and their father, although he has EOW custody, only sees them 2 - 3 times a year (due to his choice) they see their grandparents and aunt on that side around every 6 weeks

Partner is annoyed that I include their heritage as part of them and make sure that they know about the history of the country, speak the language (they are trilingual so speak 2 languages that are not english) he doesnt like hearing that particular language in the house. We celebrate their new years and some of the other festivals and religious days just like we do here with xmas and easter even though my partner and I are both atheists. This has all come to light in the past 6 weeks as we are arranging who will be where for the next 6 months (eg when the kids will be going to their dads or aunts etc) 

He thinks that as their dad is the link to this other country that he should be putting the work in supporting them understanding the country and what is going on there and the language etc but as he cant be bothered with the children its just another thing that we have to do to cover for him being a rubbish dad. the country in question is also quite controversial at the moment and my partner doesnt agree with a lot of what is going on there and is quite afraid of something happening to them because of their connection to that country. We live in an area with quite a few people of that religion and so the children do know other children that speak that language but we do not attend the language school or religious school. 

I dont even know how to start a conversation about this -My kids have aunites and uncles and cousins living in that country who we skype to probably once a month (its a great chance for the cousins to practice their English as well as my kids practicing their language) and the email with the help of parents cool pictures or memes or slime videos. As well as having 2 passports they have connections to this country and can move out there to live if they wanted to when they are 18. It is an active part of who they are rather than oh 12 generations ago 1 person in my family was from a random country. 

I really dont know what to do or say from here we havent really talked since he told me how he really felt about it all and we are just existing around each other at the moment. It is important to me that the children know where they come from and the history behind all of that and they have all the information so they can make the best choices when they are older and also encouraging language skills because lets be honest there isnt really any downsides to speaking multiple languages. 

TLDR - how do i have a conversation with my partner about him not wanting to support educating my children about their dual nationality country?",1530875559.0,VegetableWeb,relationships
Is the way my girlfriend (21f) and I (18m) argue toxic? How should I go about dealing with my own feelings of anxiety and rejection whilst encouraging a healthy relationship.,"
My (18m) gf (21f) is currently in exam season, and very stressed, which I understand, because of this her and I haven’t seen one another in a few weeks. She said something on FaceTime about my personal appearance that hurt, I waited a few hours to just see if it would go away, and it did, but than she brought up how she doesn’t like that I don’t jokingly be mean to her back. And that she “likes it.” I explained it’s not how I work, and I’ve tried hard to not be like that to her, which made her feel bad, I said it was okay that she did it, just to leave out stuff about my body (then blurting out the example from earlier in the day), and insecurities, she almost immediately said she was going to go and hangup off FaceTime, I sort of freaked out, and she said she was just stressed because of exams. Afterwards she texted me saying it was the first time in days she cried, and when I tried to comfort her she only responded with “yep” and “it’s fine.” Before saying “okay bye” and now ghosting me, she is studying so that’s probably in part of it, but I’m incredibly anxious as I usually am after our fights when we’re not in person, I never am able to reassure myself, or get the reassurance from her, that when I bring up things she’s done that have hurt me, I always feel like I’m a bad person, and that I’ve hurt her. Her response is always to leave the call, and my feelings of anxiety don’t leave for days after. I don’t know how else to deal with my emotions of anxiety and rejection, or how to bring my feelings up to her.

TLDR: girlfriend shuts me out after arguments, especially when it’s due to her hurting my feelings, it causes alot of anxiety to me, and I don’t know how to bring up how I feel healthily.",1733432629.0,ItchyMonth,relationships
How can I [22F] encourage my fiancé [21M] to contribute more at home?,"This is sort of a rant and sort of asking for advice.

I've been with Bruce since we were both 16, and we've been engaged for 1.5 years. For various (school-related) reasons we were each moving around a lot and it wasn't feasible to live together until recently. We moved into an apartment together in August, at the start of the our last year of college.

We had both been working full time at internships for a while, and I expected Bruce to have saved enough money to pay for his half of the rent while not working. I was wrong. As of last month he has $0. The budgeting thing is a separate issue that will have to wait. I still work part time, and have saved a lot (I'm not a big spender like him) so I can pay all of our expenses easily.

He has a prospect to start working sometime in January, but I have asked him to contribute in ways other than financially. I cook all the meals and do almost all of the cleaning, on top of work and school, and it's burning me out. Any time he's not in class or doing homework, he's watching TV or playing video games or D&D (I would estimate he spends ~8 hours a day doing these things). I try making chore lists for him, or asking nicely, or giving deadlines, but in the end it takes longer to convince him to do a chore than it would have taken if I just did it myself. *I don't want to order him around like a child. How can I convince him, as his partner, to step up and wash some dishes?*

"My sister [18/F] cannot carry a tune or act to save her life, but is encouraging my [25/F] parents [55/F/57/F] to pay her way to Broadway, and they're willing to pay.","My sister (Lola) is eighteen, and the baby of the family. Our parents have spoiled her rotten since she was born, despite having three other children, my brothers (19/21) and myself (25). We usually get neglected, and have had to pay for our own schooling and amenities. I only got my tuition paid for after I complained that they weren't being quite fair. My brothers have given up on college entirely, and I'm currently studying gynecology.

Lola has decided that she has a passion for theatre, after receiving minor roles in school plays for the past 3 years. She's always received a chorus part in the musical, because she cannot sing or act. On stage, she's constantly distracted, and her voice sounds like a terrible recorder performance, and that's being nice.

Last night at a family dinner, she told everyone that she wants to go to New York after high school (she's a senior). My parents asked her why, and she said she wanted to become a Broadway sensation. My brother choked on his water, and we all asked what spurred her decision. She said that she knew this was what she wanted to do, and my parents *applauded* her. They said she had much more direction than I had at her age, and will ultimately be doing more than the rest of us.

I asked my parents what made them think that while I'm in med school, and my mother replied that ""any old person can look at a vagina, it takes a real star to stand out on stage."" My father became a little more practical and asked my sister where she was going to get the money for this scheme, and she asked for a loan from them. To my horror, they agreed.

Lola is going around bragging about how she's going to be just like ""Hamilton."" She's always been pampered and has little idea of what ideas are realistic and what aren't, but this is absurd. Usually, I would let this slide and just laugh when they all come back crying, but her Broadway money is coming out of my med school money. If she ends up dragging this fantasy out longer than a year, I may very well have to find a second or even third job. How can I stop this madness and protect my tuition money?

TL;DR: My sister can't act or sing, but is being financed to get to Broadway by our parents, who are taking her expenses out of my tuition money. How can I get them to reconsider?

EDIT: It’s definitely come to my attention that I’m entitled. Almost 70 people have affirmed that for me. I do understand, but I think a lot of people aren’t entirely clear on the situation I’ve been in.

My parents are a bit nuts. They dropped thousands of dollars on a doomsday bunker when I was younger, and keep it fully stocked and force us to do “apocalypse drills” every few months. They’re also embroiled in a world of conspiracy theories and fantasy, and kept us in it too. I only realized that these theories were a little out of control when I broke my leg two years ago, and refused to take pain meds because my parents convinced me that the government used over-the-counter medications to distribute illegal drugs. My boyfriend persuaded me to take some Advil, and I promptly realized my parents were off on that one.

My dad works in finance, and I’ve always taken his word above all else. It sounds naïve, but I’ve been taught that the world of finance is corrupt, and he knows the true secrets. He “educated” me about loans in a way that made very little sense, but sounded very scary. He told me about a friend of his who killed himself because of debt, and others who lost their homes because of loans they took on in college. It sounds stupid to believe at my age, but these threads were a genuine eye opener about how loans actually work. My dad went over loans and such with me, and talked me out of about every single one.

I also do feel more resentful about my parents’ favoritism than I do about the money. My parents were exotic animal “collectors” (read: hoarders), and when my aunts and uncles convinced them to give up all the animals, they had Lola to fill the void. She was spoiled throughout her entire childhood, and the rest of us did get neglected because of it. My parents routinely stayed home with Lola rather than come out to my sporting events, and would “forget me” at grocery stores and friends’ houses.

I realize my behavior here sounds really childish, but we were always referred to as “money drains” when we were younger. I become defensive about this because it’s basically all I have to “prove” that my parents have some fair in me. Gynecology is a passion of mine, I want everyone to have good health care in a field that’s routinely ignored or shamed. If I had to give that up because of their favoritism, I’d be beyond devastated.

Thanks to everyone for their help, I’m finally understanding what my parents miseducated me about.",1506303402.0,ItsDeLovelyyy,relationships
I [25f] asked my SO [25m] what I thought was a reasonable question. He thinks it was loaded and unfair.,"So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'.

Nearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him:

* Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient.
* Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore.
* Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly).
* Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me.
* Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events.
* Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them.

This list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts.

Last night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority.

He then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say.

He is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things.

tl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered.

edit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.",1576163109.0,unfairgfthrowaway,relationships
"[UPDATE]My [26 F] with my husband [29 M] 1 year, he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, how to make it count?","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dheie/my_26_f_with_my_husband_29_m_1_year_he_has_been/)

Summary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.


Let me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore.

I'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished ""the list"" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you.

A special shout to a few people:
u/mistyranch for courage and sharing 
u/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!)
u/tacofugitive for looking out for me
u/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn
u/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions
u/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping
u/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me
u/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue
u/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year
u/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of
u/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days
u/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure
u/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments
u/daivyjones for the immense support
u/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel
and so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.

Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):
1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.
2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my ""next spouse"" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. 
3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.
4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!
5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.
6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.
7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex
8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. 
9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out. 
10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary
11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.
12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.
13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message 
14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.
15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.
16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his
17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with
   
I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget. 

I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.

In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.

Thank you all once again. 

**tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support

Edit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.

"How Can I [31/M] encourage my wife [30/F] to do something.....ANYTHING, without crushing her?"," We have been mostly together for about 10 years. We we first started dating in our early 20's she was a well rounded person Obviously the physical beauty was what first caught my eye, but getting to know her really made me fall for her. She had a thing about her, that she liked what she liked, whether it was popular or not, and she wasnt ashamed to get motivated about it. She had her own style....people knew, oh that looks like something your girlfriend would like, etc. She played multiple musical instruments. She did a LOT of art. She had hobbies and things she loved. 
Fast forward 10 years or so. Her daily routine mostly revolves around work, household chores, and at least a few hours of instgram/reddit/snapchat/pinterest/tumblr/celebrity gossip websites/etc.  She plays a musical instrument once a month, if that. She does maybe one small art project once a year. She dresses in whatever casual thing she pulls out of the closet, and anything ""HER"" has been sitting for pretty much years now. Her running shoes sit in the closet...i cant remember the last time ive seen her do yoga or a workout video, etc.
  
So here comes the issue. My wife is gorgeous/beautiful. Not just in my eyes, i've always thought she should be a model, and so have many others. When she was younger, this meant that the guys she knew only wanted one thing. And many let her know that. They couldnt care less about her interests or personal life, she was gorgeous and they wanted in her pants. She had low self esteem, and body issues so she ate up the attention. As she has gotten older she has come to resent that attention. She HATES when guys whistle or call her on the street solely for her body. She hates when the first thing people use to describe her is beautiful, etc. She has broken down multiple times to tell me she is sick of being just a pretty girl and wants to be complimented and appreciated for her talents, skills, intellect, etc.  Which i can totally understand. But it seems her actions are working to the opposite where she is removing all the other aspects of her life, leaving only the physical.


she is setting up her life to where, that makes it hard to do. We have recently moved to a new area, and most of our newer friends have no idea her talents, hobbies, etc. Its hard to find a compliment to give to someone when they are lounging around the house for 4+ hours on a tablet looking at photos of other peoples lives. 

Now comes the selfish part. When we first got together ,our sex life was frequent to say the least. as is normal, thats gone down, but at this point its almost non existent. She has said the reason is because she feels i only want her for her body and am no different than other guys from her past. I only show her so much attention when she comes out of the shower naked, or we get into bed together, etc.  Its demolished our sex life and negatively affecting our entire relationship. I still find her insanely attractive, and im stuck between purposely never telling her she is beautiful, which i dont like that idea......or telling her she is beautiful and have another argument over how i only want her for her body.

I feel I show her plenty of attention and look for ways to compliment her in many aspects. I dont think im a jerk (although, how many jerks think that about themselves). I have tried to support her over the years, buying art supplies and canvas/sketchbooks (all of which sit empty in the art closet), or musical instruments (which sit hardly played in the corner), etc. I like to think of myself as extremely supportive. I dont care if it costs some money, or my time, if its something she loves, i am willing to do it/learn it/buy it, etc. But it just seems like now, there is nothing she loves (except maybe social media platforms). I have always told her how amazing she is at those hobbies or personal things. 
 There is not much opportunities anymore to compliment her on things other than telling her she looks beautiful, which is just always there.

She is afraid of becoming ""boring"" and having no personality, or forgettable. but that seems to be just what she is becoming (i know how rude that sounds, but i dont know how else to put it). How can i encourage her to do something for HERSELF first of all, and second of all.....that will elicit compliments about another aspect of her life that is not her body. I feel like anything i bring up to tell her this, just reinforces that she is boring and has nothing in her life worth complimenting other than her body.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wife is super talented and smart and extremely beautiful. She now resents the beautiful part, and wants to be known for the talent/smart aspect. But life has gotten boring and routine, and now i need a way to encourage/motivate her to get back into those talented/smart things so that being ""beautiful"" is not all there is to her.",1492107634.0,welcomethrowaway,relationships
"My (26f) sweet, caring, loving, boyfriend (25m) went to a strip club and helped and encouraged his friend cheat on his wife. What is going on? What should I do? ","I'm 26/f and he is 25/m. We have been dating for four years and are in a very serious, committed, monogamous relationship. 

We have each other's passwords but we never check up on one another, its just for emergencies or convenience. I was trying to figure out when exactly he had booked our flight to see his family so I logged in to his email to pull up the confirmation receipt. The third email down was a thread with 50+ responses to one his close friends. They both work together and they were just talking about guy things I guess. I gathered from the emails that his friend was cheating on his wife (of only a year, who he has a baby with). I expected my boyfriend to tell him to wise up and instead he was covering for his friend and just being all around supportive. We are friends with his wife who is just a sweet heart. She doesn't deserve this. 

So after I read this, I did snoop through older emails. Just a lot of misogynistic language about everyone - which is surprising because it is so not like my boyfriend. What bothered me most though was they went to strip clubs on at least two occasions. I found chat logs from when they were talking and matched the chats with when the emails were going back and forth about the strip clubs. My boyfriend went back for private dances (as did his POS friend) and they both were shirtless and they were feelings all over the girls. I don't have a ton of detail beyond that but his friend said the stripper touched his dick so I assume same goes with my boyfriend. 

I'm pretty freaking mad. The encouraging his friend to cheat is fucked up but the strip clubs too. He never mentioned it and he spent money that we should have been saving. We are trying to save for a house and we are being really frugal and he went and dropped a lot of cash on other women. WTF. And not to mention that he was getting lap dances and feeling on some other girl's tits. Its pretty damn close to cheating in my eyes. 

Its so unlike him. He is the best guy I have EVER been with. He is so sweet and caring and goes out of his way to do loving things for me, even after 4 years. We have the perfect relationship and this shit is so not him. I'm amazed he could do this. I don't know what to make of it and I don't know what I should do. I don't want to break up with him over this but its not okay either. I'm planning on confronting him when he gets home tonight but I'm not sure what to do exactly. I'd love some advice. 

tl;dr My perfect boyfriend was a bit of an asshole in some emails to his friend and helped his friend cheat on his wife and they both went to strip clubs and got lap dances. I'm furious. ",1354933946.0,R-E-S-P,relationships
I (24m) don't want to come off as weird to my apparent guardian angel (40m),"**UPDATE:** 

Thank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like ""father figure"" or ""guardian angel"" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything.

Also!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know! 

Also also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?  

Thanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!!

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Most of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often.

About a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  ""You just need to be a barber.""  I laughed, and he reiterated, ""No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber.""

Flash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!

During every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.

This is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.

He has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like \*I\* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please!

&#x200B;

What can I do to encourage my wife in the bedroom?,"TL;DR me M(30) and my wife F(31) can't seem to connect physically since the birth of our son. It's been almost 2 years and I'm getting frustrated.

Looking for some perspective on how I can rekindle my physical relationship with my wife after our son was born. It's been 2 years and we are both very vocal and open about our love life but we just can't seem to connect like we use to. I totally understand and am trying to be patient but it's been almost 2 years. She's a stay at home mom and I work shift work. So we already don't get hardly any alone time but it still feels like she has almost 0 interest in physical intimacy. She always ""touched out"" by our toddler. I hate feeling like she's not interested in me anymore. She's even gone so far as to admit she doesn't even masterbate anymore, zero desire. We are both very open and have communicated about this topic many times but it doesn't seem like there's any resolution. We always seem to argue about which one of us is more tired and desperate for a break. I keep finding myself drawn to porn despite not wanting to because ive been exercising recently and have been having increased desire but shes never in the mood. If we do have sex it feels like pity and she doesnt act excited or into it at all. Any advice would be nice. Thanks",1727636392.0,One_Flounder,relationships
Update - How do I encourage my BF he's not just a trauma bond,"Tl;Dr., we are good, and talked it out. Can't write it all out in the moment, but I will update you when I return.

Old post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/3zf4MMXYwQ


My (F30s) BF ""Han""(M30s) and I hit a rough spot, but I am super happy today. Sorry for not linking or summarizing, but I am on my phone right now at the airport and don't have a bunch of time.

I again can not express what the reddit community means to me and the kind, supportive, and sweet messages and comments I have received.

In short, Han and I sat down and talked. He showed up at my place 1 night, and I was not in the best mental state, so I eventually broke down and cried on the couch. Not mature, I know. I expressed how lost I felt, how much I care about him, how much it threw and hurt me when I said ""I love you"" for the first time and he didn't say it back...everything. 

Turns out I was upset over *almost* nothing. Almost because he did have trouble with my brother's comments, and was very much troubled, and he was temporarily worried that I trauma bonded and didn't actually have feelings for him. It shook him enough to get a session with his therapist, and he was able to work through the insecurities in realizing the things I do for him and how I love him. It was so good to hear that and that he knew how much I love him.

He then gave me the kicker. He was distant because he was hiding something - a surprise for me. By nature of my job, there is a weird break in August where there is kind of nothing to do, so we essentially all, but Finance and the like take the month off. Well, Han took 2 weeks off, and he saved up for tickets to Aruba. Nearly two weeks in absolute paradise. I can't tell you how thrilled I was and how quickly I canceled my dentist appt, oil change all that crap. I am now packed up and waiting for our flight. He has us set up at a resort his brother works for, and so I also get to meet his twin brother and his SIL. I am beyond excited and a little nervous, but overall, I'm happy. 

Aaron isnhapoy for me and Inhave suspicions he knew, but that's for me to Nancy Drew when I get back. For now, a much freaking needed vacation is all I need. I hope to share on my page about how it goes in 2 weeks. 😊

Update: we've only been back a couple days but wanted to say that OMG Aruba is BEAUTIFUL and I didn't want to leave. I loved meeting Hans's family as well and everyone seemed to like me well enough in varying degrees. Life is still hectic but having that short reprieve really helped my mental health. We spent most of the time in the ocean or sitting on the sand just talking or reading or just vibing.  I love Han so much and he loves me too I think becauae now he's saying it almost as much as he constantly shows it. Thanks for the all the advice you guys. As always Reddit helps me sort out my feelings to allow me to think and feel supported even by strangers all over. I hope you all are well.

Husband kissed SIL,"This is so messy. My (42F) husband (45M) kissed my brother’s wife two nights ago while both were incredibly intoxicated. My brother is (was) my husband’s best friend. My husband also works for my brother. We’ve been married 4 years but together 9 years. My niece (11f) caught them mid kiss. I don’t know if things would have gone further if they hadn’t been caught. I haven’t talked with my SIL but I talked with my brother. He is inclined to believe that this was a one time screw up. I don’t know what to believe. My husband cheated early on in our relationship, about a year in. We worked through it but now I feel so stupid and wonder if he is just a cheater and this is his pattern. He did tell me as soon as he was up. He hasn’t exactly apologized other than saying “I f***** up”. He dumped all his alcohol when I said if we stay together that’s one of my conditions. He has a history of alcohol abuse. He has scheduled an STD screening, again, at my request and blocked my SIL on everything. I’m absolutely sick about this. I’m devastated that my niece’s world is forever changed. My husband is very close with all of the niblings and that is ruined. His friendship is ruined with my brother. His employment is compromised (brother did not fire my husband) but it will be awkward and different. My friendship with my SIL is over. I’ve still been working through feelings 8 years after the first betrayal. I don’t know if I have it in me to do the incredibly hard work again. I love him and I deserve so much better.

TL:DR Husband AND SIL kissed and got caught by niece.

Edit: I just sat down with my husband and told him that I don’t want to work things out. He said he understands and that I deserve better. I told him he was right. 

Thank you for the support, encouragement, and affirming comments. I agree with the majority of them and just needed the reminders. 

He’s agreed to work things out amicably as far as finances and sorting things while he also saves to move out. We don’t share children but we each have children that will be hurt by the split. 

I don’t hate him, or her. I’m honestly just sad and disgusted. I’m not really even angry anymore. At least right now. I imagine my feelings will vary as I grieve this loss of a partner.

Edit 2:  I messaged my SIL. She apologized, but it’s very hollow and only after I finally confronted her.  And she is lying about a message she sent my husband that he admits to deleting after they were caught. Doesn’t make any sense why husband would lie about getting and deleting a message. Husband says he can’t fully recall what she sent, but that it was about getting caught. They are both full of shit really.",1692637321.0,gearl13,relationships

Well everybody, I don't know how I managed to do it...but I did it. I ended things last night.


I went to my parents house after work last night after having felt very emotional and on the verge of tears all day long. I was just getting to a point where I couldn't stand the thought of going home. To make matters worse, my boyfriend was trying to push me into going on a trip to Hawaii with him for my upcoming birthday. Obviously I did NOT want to go at all and spend that time with him alone, but I was having a very hard time asserting myself with him and just kept saying ""I don't know if I can get the time off"" and things like that, which upset him even further. He couldn't comprehend how I wasn't falling all over myself to go on this vacation with him. So this was creating a lot of conflict inside me, and as soon as I got to my mom and dad's yesterday, I just broke down sobbing and couldn't stop for at least a couple hours.


I left their place and got back to my house at about 9 p.m. He had gotten me flowers and written me a nice card, which is pretty out of the ordinary. It said something like, ""I'm sorry, I've been a jerk,"" blah blah blah. Then he goes, ""I noticed you put a password on your laptop. What are you hiding from me?"" and just being accusatory and trying to drag something non-existant out of me. For some reason, at that moment, I just kind of left my body and decided that this was happening, right here right now. Despite not wanting to do the breakup one on one, it just kind of happened.


I told him that I don't think this is working out anymore. This turned into 2 1/2 hours of him begging me to give him ""one more chance."" He said he'll go to therapy, he said he will change, he said he will never say anything mean again. He just kept saying over and over, ""Please give me one more chance, I don't understand why you can't just give me one more chance."" I told him that I have spent 4.5 years giving him hundreds of chances, and that I can't subject myself to it one more time, and if I did, I would be insane. I said that I'm broken, depressed, and have to get out for my own well-being.


He would go from begging to saying ""HOW DARE YOU ASK ME FOR A FAVOR"" when I asked if he could watch the cats until I find somewhere to put them. Then a few sentences later, he would say ""HOW COULD YOU TAKE THE CATS AWAY FROM ME"" and ""DID YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD MAKE *ME* FEEL???"" and other stuff like that.


I have to say, it was very difficult standing there and repeating over and over that I could not give him one more chance. I had to continually tell myself in my head, ""Stand your ground. Don't back down, don't back down, don't back down.""


When I was packing up my essential things to take to my parents', he saw me grabbing my laptop (his Christmas present for me) and said ""I'm going to need to take that back."" I absolutely refused to give it to him and after he tried intimidating me, I told him I would call the cops if he tries taking it away. I know that seems kind of extreme, but I was not willing to let him bully me around. He went to the bathroom and I took all my valuables and sprinted to my car and put them safely in the trunk, and ran back inside with him none the wiser.


After the 2 1/2 hours, he finally said something like, ""I don't know how to say goodbye. I guess it's time for you to go."" I took all my crap and lugged it out to my car and drove to my parents house in a mental fog, not even feeling like I was inside my body.


I cannot believe I actually did it, and I did it all by myself. If it weren't for the support from my family, close friends, and ESPECIALLY you incredible people here on Reddit, I don't know if I could have done it.


Unfortunately, I had to leave my cats there. I have sent his mother a very sweet and apologetic e-mail, asking if she could please help take care of them while I find a place to put them. She is very very fond of my kitties and thinks of them as her grandchildren, so I really hope this wasn't inappropriate. I just need to know that they will be okay, and she knows how crazy her son can get and I would be shocked if she faulted me for having to get away from this toxic relationship.


I barely slept last night, but I knew I still needed to come into work to keep myself busy. I feel this strange mix of guilt...cautious relief...anxiety about tying up loose ends...but I DID IT. The worst part is over. My family will help me with the rest, but I did the hardest part. It's just unreal. I can't believe that I'm free. Best of all, my birthday is coming up on April 20th and I am just so happy that I won't have to spend it with him. This is the best birthday present I could have ever given myself.


Thank you all so much for your support. Any post-breakup words of encouragement are very welcomed.

UPDATE: My (24F) boyfriend (26M) has a long time female friend who's clearly into him and I don't know what I should do.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mnltmh/my\_24f\_boyfriend\_26m\_has\_a\_long\_time\_female/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mnltmh/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_has_a_long_time_female/)

After reading the comments I decided to just bring it up with him without telling him what I want him to do, to avoid sounding controlling.

I sat him down and told him that some of the stuff that she says really makes me uncomfortable. I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it.

He said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side.

He can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying ""my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore"" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text ""Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s\*\*t"". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like ""what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you"" ""I think you're misunderstanding"" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though.

I could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her.

Safe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was ""I WON!!!"" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations.

Thanks for the helpful advice everyone.

TLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great. Thanks to everyone for the great advice.",1618161056.0,ThrowRAjai0509355,relationships
"I [32M] love my wife [30F] as a person, but she's completely dependent on me and I can no longer handle her as a spouse","I am going to try my best to describe this situation, but I feel like I'm having trouble organizing it.  Please ask clarifying questions if needed.

I have been married to my wife for 8 years.  We've always gotten along spectacularly from a social standpoint.  Unfortunately, she came from a difficult home life, with two abusive parents who she was still living with when we met.  She moved in with me after about 8 months of dating, partially just to escape what she was enduring.  But that was fine - I was starting out a career after college, and having the company was really meaningful to me.

During these first few months, we tried to take steps to get her help and move past her trauma.  She started therapy and we tried to get her on anxiety meds.  At the same time, she was still depending on her parents for medical insurance and her parents began to ""forget"" to provide her meds as a form of control (including important things like inhalers for her asthma).  Due to the trauma and being far behind on life experience due to her parents, she was in no state to work, so we made the decision to get married much earlier than planned so she could be on my health insurance.  It was a small courthouse ceremony, which we were fine with.

We continued getting her care, but I noticed that things never changed.  She would have days where she just felt so off that she couldn't get out of bed.  Other days, she's stuck in the bathroom all day.  Her sleep schedule drifted all over the place.  We would try to go out and do things and she'd have to back out because she felt sick.  There was always something standing in the way of her becoming a functional member of society.

We kept looking into these problems.  Now that she had reliable medical care, she continued to be diagnosed with more and more chronic conditions: as of writing she has been found to have CPTSD, depression, ADHD, PCOS, IBS, AERD, asthma and psoriasis.  The list just kept growing, and it seemed like getting her into a functional state was just impossible.  But she was finding out what was wrong, and attempting treatment.  That was good.  I was willing to be patient with her and help her get better.  I've always made enough money to support both of us.  Overall we live very comfortably.  We hoped to work through the issues, live a quiet life for now, and eventually have more adventures when her conditions were managed.  

But here we are 8 years later and things look almost exactly the same.  Basically her whole life is within the bounds of the house.  She gets up at whatever random hour she wakes up, lays in bed for a while watching videos on her phone, moves to the living room and either plays video games on her computer or lays on the couch and watches Youtube on the TV or reads things online on her phone.  When I'm out there, we'll hang out and talk.  Sometimes we play games or watch videos together.  She'll move between the couch and computer a few times.  Sometimes she's on a voice call with some friends.  Then the day's over whenever she feels tired or sick and she goes back to bed.  That's it - every single day.

She wears the same outfits for days at a time (when she bothers to wear clothes), and showers once a month at most.  I've tried to encourage her to take more but she claims that it takes so much energy out of her to do so and that ""you're not supposed to shower every day anyway"".  Sometimes the burden on her does seem to be true, where she's struggling afterwards due to the heat or whatnot, but I think she doesn't give herself enough credit either.  She definitely was a lot better at the beginning with that - maybe not every day, but most days.  Needless to say, she tends to have a stench.  Of course, if someone is visiting she is able to force herself to take a shower, or uses enough dry shampoo to cover the smell.

She doesn't do chores around the house, even when I have split them up with her and given specific, simple tasks.  For instance, I gave her something small like emptying the garbage cans in the bathrooms when they get full.  Instead she just lets them overflow and claims she forgot.  Or maybe crushing pop cans for recycling - oh... she's too tired to do that.  The only place she cleans is her desk, and only when company is visiting.

The way I interpret her failure to do things, it's like she has become ridiculously risk averse - if there is even the slight possibility she won't be able to complete something, she won't start it.  And when she does start it, that fear of not finishing makes her sick and then fulfills the prophecy.  So she keeps doing less and less and never wants to expand her horizons.

Trying to do things outside the house with her is like pulling teeth.  Medical appointments, she's fine with... but dinner dates?  Best we can do is cheap fast food, and she will probably want to leave as quickly as possible if she's even up to going there in the first place.  Usually, she'd rather I just pick it up in the drive through and bring it home.  Visiting family for holidays is a nightmare.  She's always looking for an excuse not to go, and if we're there I have to keep an eye on her the whole time to make sure she is okay.  She'll constantly text me asking when we're going to leave.  So I end up cutting things short.  I have better family visits when I just go on my own, but then everyone asks why she isn't there.

Regardless of the event, though, I have to prepare her days in advance.  Constant reminders, trying to force her to realign her sleep schedule (and waking her up for things - she refuses to use alarms), making sure she showers.  I can't even get her to take walks - it's too hot, it's too cold, too many bugs, too sunny, you name it.

I've asked her before, what happened to our plans from before?  But now she says she ""isn't really all that interested"" in going out and doing things now.  Neither of us are social butterflies but based on how we talked in the early days, I thought she'd at least want to go on trips with just the two of us.  You know, see some museums, some natural wonders, silly tourist traps, that kind of thing.  Or on a less significant note, just going to local events.  I like having those special moments and sharing them - not all the time, but enough to be significant.  Instead, now my life starts to mirror hers.  I'm always at home, don't go out, just doing crap on the computer all day.  Doing things on my own is an option, and I have, but the sharing of it is a big part of the enjoyment to me.  I only have a few local friends, having moved to this area as an adult for work, and a lot of times they aren't able to do these things with me because, as we get into our 30s, it's stuff they'd rather do with their own partner and/or kids.

The problem is, as long as we're just at home hanging out, having fun, and talking to each other, everything is great, and because we're home a lot it ends up masking some of the issues.  We get along so well in that respect and have a deep comfort with each other to just be ourselves, warts and all.  We very rarely argue, she is never mean to me, and always thankful for what I do.  She always seems well intentioned and while I'm not the best at reading people, she always appears genuine to me.  But I can no longer envision us doing anything more than being at home.  No trips.  No special events.  No accomplishing things together.  Hell, I can barely even picture us cooking dinner together.  Whether it actually is her health, or trauma, or just some kind of internal unwillingness to grow, it's apparent that she isn't growing with me and probably never will.

I know I have unintentionally enabled her this whole time.  It has been the path of least resistance as I navigate the challenges of life and my own personal struggles.  I haven't been able to decisively put my foot down - every time I do I end up backing off.  When I have tried to have discussions about this, it always ends the same way.  She starts sobbing, claims she's ""trying \[her\] best"" and goes mute for days.  So of course I stop trying to fight her - what's the point, I already know how it's going to end.

Obviously, there's a mental health component here.  Maybe the trauma really did break something inside her.  Unfortunately, she seems resistant to treatment.  Not as in she won't get treatment - but that none of the treatments are doing anything.  She's been trying different medications for years now with nothing making her budge, with the exception of finally eliminating most of her trauma nightmares (that's a good thing, of course!).  She goes to therapy, but that doesn't seem to help either.  In fact, once the therapist said that she didn't think she could make any more progress because my wife wasn't taking any action.  That stopped the therapy for a while, but she has recently started going back.  I'm still not seeing any action coming out of it.  I wanted her to try EMDR therapy for her CPTSD, but she thinks it's pseudoscience despite reading plenty of research showing it works.  I can't force her to, she's an adult.

Last year, I noticed my own executive function declining and sought help.  During that time I did a lot of introspection as well.  I suddenly realized just how messed up this all was.  I tried to tell her that I had long term doubts unless we could turn this all around.  It ended exactly as described above.  We ended up trying couples therapy, which brought many good ideas to the table and reminded us of the idea of compromise.  Maybe I can't get everything I want, but she can rise a bit to meet me in the middle.  We tried to better divide chores, try to commit to doing things more often... trying to get her to shower even just once a week.  She ended up reneging on every single thing.  I began to lose the urge to fight again, but the thoughts keep dwelling in my head.  I know that this situation isn't right and isn't what I want.

I've watched my 20s slip away from me with very little to show for it except working day in and day out.  My 30s are starting to look the same, and if that happens, the rest of my life will likely follow the same pattern.  As we get older, I will probably have to care more and more for her, beyond the usual aging concerns, and it will get harder for me.  Is she doing this maliciously?  Taking advantage of my hospitality?  Or, is it just that her mental health is that bad?  If she only actually loves me for being a meal ticket, she sure does a good job acting.  But at the same time, her actions don't match up to her words.

I feel backed into a corner with two options.  1) Keep the status quo and keep slowly trying to help her, as I keep shedding years off my life.  Or, 2) Divorce her, free myself of the burden, and try to start over.  Which sounds ""simple"" enough, but I will likely still carry a great burden - I know she believes there are no options for her outside of this marriage.  She's said before in passing that if it ends (for instance, if I get in an accident and die), she's killing herself, no ifs ands or buts.  I know this is a classic sign of an abusive partner.  I also know that she probably isn't bluffing.  She made attempts before as a teenager, before I met her.  Can I risk that?  I don't want her to die.  And I know that if it's a direct result of my desires, that I will always consider myself responsible.  To me, it would effectively be making a statement that I considered my life to be worth more than hers.

She's also technically right that there's nowhere else to go.  She has no college education, no work experience, no driver's license, no credit history, no local friends, no family she interacts with, and basically no exposure to ""adulting"" so to speak.  There's no other support network than what I provide.  If I leave, and she does stay alive, she has few options.  She can't even go back to her parents - not only are we estranged from them, but I understand that they are now both hospitalized and nearing end of life due to poor lifestyle choices.  I've tried to build a safety net for her just in case, but she just has no interest in it.  Driving - ""I don't have anywhere to go"" or ""I think I'll get distracted and crash, it's too dangerous"".  School, she just refuses to ever go back, says she can't bear to do it again.  There's an excuse for everything.

I came into this leveraging my good position in life to help someone I loved who was in need, but at this point it just feels like my gifts were squandered, maliciously or not.  I set myself on fire to keep her warm, but my wick is just about burned out.  As a friend said, it's like I am taking care of a child.  I still love her, but less as a partner and more as just someone close to me, like a family member (yes, I know a spouse is technically a family member - you know what I mean).  The romance is gone and I can't see her as an equal like this.  If she got better, would the feelings come back?  Maybe, but my hopes are so low they might as well not exist.

Is there any hope left to get her on the path to growth?

If not, what can I do to help her find her footing after me, and avoid having her death on my conscience?

TL;DR: My wife has many illnesses and uses them as an excuse to basically be a NEET and just sit around all day. I think she can do better, but no longer has the willpower to.  I realized I want more in life, but I'm worried if I leave her she will just kill herself.",1726845461.0,Sad-Jellyfish-8215,relationships
How can I encourage my boyfriend when he feels like a failure? ,"My (31 F) boyfriend (32 M) of 3 months recently had an exam that he did not pass.

Trying to change them or encouraging growth? ,"Here’s where I come from: my (25F)partner (26F) and I have a lot of disagreements lately, mostly about what it means to be a team, how we perceive relationships, ect. Basically, everything that defines an “us” according to… us. We’ve been together for 10 months now

My partner has never been in a relationship (we’re both 26) and I have been dating since adolescence. They are a very independent person naturally, so I try to find a middle ground on many things to make them comfortable. As an example, they don’t like having to say they won’t be home, what they’re doing, ect. It’s not about secrets, if I ask about their day they’ll tell me everything, they just don’t like having to text me for every minor disruption to routine. It doesn’t bother me at all, I simply get it if they’re not home by 6, and if I actually have to know, i’ll ask. 

The issue comes with “learning to be in a relationship”. For example, not leaving for work with all the leftovers in one big pot so they don’t have to repackage it (leaving me to find a different meal). I have to say to them it doesn’t make any sense for them to realize it, realize that I also need some. They always think in a me and you and not an “us”. That situation is an example of many. 

Is that something anyone has ever faced and am I insane to think that’s something that can be learnt, or am I just trying to change someone when we all know that doesn’t work? 
10 months in I truly thought we’d have made more progress (we have, but clearly not enough for everyone to be comfortable in the relationship). They are serving single child and I’m exhausted…
Edit; I forgot to mention a very important fact, we have been friends for 14 years, besties for 4, that’s what is making me think the switch is very hard on them 
Tl;dr Partner won’t take into consideration the fact that there’s an “us” in most situations and mostly functions as a spoiled single child, can someone grow into it or am I trying to change them? ",1724976109.0,Right-Low2718,relationships
My wife (33F) lied to me (28M) about her age,"TL;DR: My wife and I have been together for 5 years, having recently gotten married and had a baby. Today I found out that my wife is two years older than I had previously been led to believe and was using a misprint on her drivers license as her real age. Looking for help through this situation.

When my wife's family was visiting earlier, we were talking about how long we would wait until we have our next child. I asked my mother in law how long she waited between having children and she said 4 years... My wife corrected her and said, ""no, 6 years"" which I could see my MIL reacted oddly to. Reason being, my brother in law is 37 and so if he's 4 years older than my wife, that would make her 33. After seeing this exchange my heart sank because I knew in my gut that my wife had been lying to me about her age. This is because this event marked the third time in 2 months that I  had encountered information that suggested my wife has been misrepresenting her age.

The first time was in the hospital when my wife was going into labor 2 months ago. On the display of the medical device, it listed her birth year as 1990, and I pointed out to the nurse that the date was incorrect. They said they would need proof in order to change that date, so my wife showed them her old ID (with her maiden name) and the nursing staff was able to make the change. I thought it was weird that the system would have the wrong date, but my wife said her old ID had a clerical error and that was the one that she had registered with the hospital. As I understand it, these errors are rare and can only be corrected by showing two copies of your identification (in this case, passport and birth certificate). For some reason, this stuck with me in my head and I started questioning myself on the subject, but ultimately I decided to believe my wife. After all, I had seen her ID before and it said 1992 and we filled out our marriage license with that date without issue.

The second time was a month ago when my MIL was visiting and talking about when my wife was a baby. Since I was already having questions about my wife's birthday, I asked her, ""and what year was this"" to which she replied, ""1990"". I asked her if she meant 1992 and she said ""oh... yes"". At this point I was on high alert that something was up. I mentioned to my wife after the family had left that it was silly of her mom to forget what year she was born. My wife responded that she didn't know what I was talking about and that she didn't think her mom would have said that. I told her that I definitely heard her mom say that but she told me that I must have misheard her or her mom made a mistake. At this point, I went through my wife's closest friends' Instagram profiles and saw that the majority of them were in their mid thirties, not early thirties. Being overwhelmed by what I was seeing, I convinced myself that I was probably overthinking this whole situation and that the clerical error, her mom forgetting her birth year, and her being the youngest of all of her friends by a bit were unlikely coincidences but not impossible. I stopped short of going through my wife's belongings as that would be a massive invasion of privacy and she would certainly be aware as she is home on maternity leave.

That leads us back to the present and the family discussion about her brother's age gap. Of course, I brought this up with the thought of entertaining my suspicion, but seeing my MIL's reaction to my wife's correction told me everything I needed to know. This was the third insinuation that my wife was born in 1990, and at this point I couldn't deny it any longer. I excused myself for a bathroom break and her family left shortly after I returned downstairs. We cleaned a bit and got the baby changed, and when my wife sat down I said that something was bothering me and we needed to talk. I explained to her that 3 times over the last couple of months, there's been insinuations that my she is 33 years old. She responded that it's because she is.

After some silence, I asked my wife to explain herself and she said that this all traces back to when she got her driver's license in 2018. A clerical error had indeed been made, but one that printed her birth year as 1992 instead of the one on her birth certificate, which is 1990. As a result, she started getting jobs with that identification and for reasons that remain unclear, decided to use that age on her dating profile before we met. At that time, I was 23 and was only looking for matches between the ages of 20 and 26 so I distinctly remember her profile having that age setting, something which she still denies intentionally doing. On our first date, I even remember looking at her license since we got cocktails at dinner and sure enough her birth year indicated that she was 26. I asked her why she would lie about her real age, and she said that she never knew our relationship would get this serious... the longer time went on the bigger this lie became. She said that she has wanted to come clean about it for a long time but she was afraid early on in our relationship that I would have left her if I knew she was 5 years my senior. To be fair, she may be right as this would have been a larger age gap than I would have been comfortable with at 23. She even tried feeling me out at that time asking questions like, ""what would you do if I were even older than I am"" and I had answered basically that we probably wouldn't be dating in that case. For fear of losing me, she let this lie fester, and she said that this lie was in the back of her head during every major milestone we shared together. When I asked her to be my girlfriend, when I asked her to move in with me, when I asked her to marry me, when we got pregnant with our baby, when we got married, when we welcomed our baby into the world... Unknown to me my wife had an inner conflict that our relationship had been built on a lie and each time one of those milestones passed she chose to keep up the act instead of coming clean.

She says now that she feels much better for having finally come clean, but now we're so far down the road I don't know what to do. I don't quite know how I would have reacted in the past to this discovery, and that was before we got married and had a kid together. She's my love and my best friend, but I can't shake the feeling that our relationship was built on a lie. I'm also wondering what else my wife is capable of lying about if she could keep something as foundational as how old she is a secret for so long. In fact, all of her new documentation (license, passport) has her correct birth year on it now since she changed her name, so it was only a matter of time before I found out. My wife said that she recognized this and was getting ready to write me a letter on the subject. She even showed me her draft of this letter in her phone, dated back a month ago after the second event I mentioned earlier. Apparently, her mom had mentioned to her at that time that she needed to get that date ""corrected"", and today reinforced the point that she needed to say something to me after the third event. MIL encouraged her to be positive about the situation and that she is still the same person, regardless of her age.

MIL is right about this part, I do love my wife as a partner and a mother, but I'm struggling with the notion that we would have never met if my wife didn't lie about her age and probably would not have continued our relationship had I found out earlier. Now we have a great family life but it all started and was perpetuated by a lie. I have no idea how we are going talk about this with my family or our friends, as this could seriously impact how they see her. My wife and I both grew up in broken homes and neither of us want to impose that on our children. Part of the reason why my wife claims she didn't tell me the truth is that she was convinced that I would walk out on her and get a divorce. I haven't done that and am instead looking for recommendations on how to navigate this situation. How would you recommend we broach this topic with our friends and family? How can I rebuild my trust in my wife? How can I handle my feelings of betrayal?

UPDATE: I want to thank you all for the feedback, good or bad. One thing I want to emphasize is that I do not care that my wife is 5 years older than me. Sure, there was a time where this would have been an issue for me, but we are well past that. The issue for me is and has been the continued lies and actions to support a mistake that was made a long time ago. I also spoke to my wife again today after gathering my thoughts and considering the advice that's been shared here. I told her that I love her, that I have no interest in divorcing, and that I want to be a husband to her and a father to our child. But I also expressed again how hurt I was by her lying to me and that we were going to have to work together to reach a point where I can trust her. This will take time, but I'm sure we can do it, barring any setbacks. We agreed to meet with a counselor weekly until we feel comfortable and are working this week to resolve our documents that have her errant DOB. We also have no plans on discussing this matter with friends or family unless there is reason to. The one thing we won't do is be deceitful.",1703694803.0,ThrowRA-BigLie,relationships
My [31F] partner [34M] takes nearly everything I do personally. I think he needs to do some extensive work on his mental health. How can I encourage him to seek more help?,"Edit for additional info: I am already in therapy for myself and have been for awhile. Thanks to all who suggested it though. 

My partner and I have been together for years. Lived together for most of it. 

I’ve felt for a long time that I am not seen by him as a separate person with my own wants, needs, and motivations that have nothing to do with him. I haven’t been able to articulate the feeling until very recently. But for most of our relationship I’ve been letting that affect me, the decisions I make, and how I spend my time, so much that I’ve realized I’m feeling completely drained by the relationship. 

I feel like I’m not allowed to have feelings. I’m not allowed to be sick. I’m not allowed to be tired. Because if I ever express feeling these things he takes it personally. Like I only have headaches to avoid intimacy. Or I only feel tired to avoid spending time with him. 

And according to him the only way for him to feel loved and like I’m attracted to him is if I’m having sex with him. Every. Single. Day. Over the course of the last month he’s escalated his behavior around this to just sleeping in another room anytime I even hint at not being immediately interested when he is. 

But we have sex at least 4 times a week on average, usually more. And if not sex I’ll give him oral or hand stuff. Because if I don’t for even one day he’s back to being mopey and angry and feeling slighted. 

But I also feel like I haven’t had a legitimate day off in over a month. I’m either at work, or working on everything at home. I’ve been going non-stop and just have nothing left to give. I’m done changing my behavior to keep him happy. I’m going to do what I need and want to do for myself. 

I want him to go to therapy, because he has a lot of work he needs to do. If he truly can’t feel love or like he’s attractive or has worth if it’s not through sex, he needs help. If he feels like everything I do or feel is about him, he needs help. But he doesn’t see it that way. He sees it as me not caring about him. 

What can I even do here? I can get him therapist visits, online or in person, for free from my job. So it’s not like he doesn’t have access to mental health care. And he has health insurance and a doctor. He takes an antidepressant and occasional anti-anxiety med but I feel like he needs more. He needs to do more than just take meds and keep being an ass. Please help.

TL;DR: partner believes every feeling I have is because of him. Only feels love from sex, and treats me like I’m neglecting him if I skip even one day. How I can encourage him to try therapy or something else?",1685100332.0,Savings_Lion_6901,relationships
[UPDATE] I [24M] think my girlfriend [25F] is cheating on me,"To see the original story, I’ve linked it
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dihwh9/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_25f_is_cheating_on_me/)

[MOVING UPDATE]: She left an hour ago and got all of her things. She brought her friend, who was also my friend too, and they were packing her stuff.  But also giggling like a couple of teenagers? All I did was sit and catch up on some emails from work, not paying attention to either of them. After about 3 hours, she had all of her things in boxes. She tried to take some things that were mine, and I told her calmly that she didn’t pay for it, so to please leave it with me. I contacted the nice couple we rent our house from and they were extremely supportive and are letting me change all of the locks, so my buddy and I are going to do that tonight. He is also helping me move my desk and electronics to the spare bedroom, since my ex used it as a closet and storage space. When she left, I finally saw some remorse, but I think she was just being nice to me because she was happy to be going to that guy’s house. She hugged me goodbye, and I let her because that’s my way of getting physical closure. Whenever she hugged me, she would run her fingers through my hair, and she did it for the last time today. As she left I felt sad, but I also felt optimistic because I can now live in peace without carrying that burden of wondering if she is cheating on me. From now on, my life is just me, my family and friends and of course my pets. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. If anything else happens, I’ll try to remember to update. But until then, I’ll see you all around. 

Edit #2: Wow thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom and support. To answer some frequently asked questions, since there’s too many responses to reply to individually I’ll post them here. 
1. After this, I don’t have any intentions to ever get back together with her. She made it known who and what she wants, so I am going to put all of my energy towards my job and family and friends. Even if she does come crawling back, I will not have her number and she will have no way to contact me.
2. I wasn’t her first boyfriend but I was her first serious one. We got together when we were 19. I met her while I attended college and she worked at this restaurant just outside of campus. We were each other’s first couple milestones. Such as moving in together, getting animals together, giving a good part of our lives to each other.
3. I know there is better for me out there. Thank you guys for picking me up. For now, I will only focus on furthering my career and being the man of my family since my dad passed away in July. When it’s time for me to date, I will know. In time, I will find the right one, a great one. 
4. With the suggestions of my friends and most of you, I am going to get tested Monday morning. I don’t think there was anything being passed around, but you can never be too careful. So yes, Monday morning I’m going to make sure nothing is wrong. 

Edit: I appreciate the advice about how NFP is not a form of contraceptive, I get that. It’s definitely not something to do if you don’t want children. However before this cheating and sneaking around began, we were headed towards marriage (me planning on proposing for our 6 year anniversary in January) and wanting to start a family right away. For us and the state of our relationship at the time, and specifically for my latex allergy, we were comfortable with doing that. We were committed to it and had no problems or scares during the 5 years we were doing it. It doesn’t work for everyone, so please be careful. Please, guys, the last thing I want is to be scolded that I shouldn’t have used that method. I’m just looking for some pick me ups and kind words. Let’s put all that other stuff aside. Thank you.


So update as of yesterday, I asked her how come she had grown so distant. She didn’t give me any sort of answer, so I just asked. “Is there another guy?” I got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder. She told me that I just wasn’t the one for her. She got no satisfaction from me anymore and that I was just a weight in her life that kept her down. For the record, I haven’t stopped her from pursuing her dream career, even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so. I have always been respectful of her needs and wants. I like to think I have been a decent boyfriend to her. She asked for an immediate break up, because she was gonna move some stuff into the new guys house. I told her that was fine. But she had to get her stuff out at once. I didn’t want her to come back two and three times a week to get her things. She wants nothing to do with our pets so I am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom, who could use some company since my dad passed away a few months ago. It’s really hard to see how cold she was. No tears or sense of regret. So tomorrow (Saturday) she is taking all of her stuff in her dad’s pickup truck and moving to that guy’s house. I asked her how long this had been going on, and she said 2 months. It’s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time. I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren’t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. I’m sad because this is a woman I’ve grown to love and essentially have grown with as an individual. I just can’t believe how much she’s changed over these past couple of weeks. Hopefully she finds what she truly wants and is happy.

TLDR- my girlfriend I suspected of cheating on me confessed. We broke up and she is moving in with her new guy.",1571413007.0,theforgettableguy,relationships
I can't handle my husband's obesity any more,"EDIT:  Thank you all so far for the responses - I'm struggling to read them all!  I'll try to address some of the reoccurring questions/comments here, but I am trying to get to them individually!

1. The body odour issue is more a change in his personal scent, not a hygiene issue - I'm a *very* scent-driven person, so I noticed the change in probably the last 2, maybe 3 years or so.  He showers every day, and I don't think it's something other people really notice, but me being in close proximity and familiar with his scent it is noticeably awful.

2. Those pointing out depression are right, and I should have added that detail.  He is on an anti-depressant, which helps regulate but it's definitely not a cure-all for mental health.

2. There is definitely a metric shitload of undealt with trauma in his past and significant issues that he's working through - he still struggles with recognizing just how violent his own upbringing was and how it affects his behaviour.  To be fair, he has made some significant behavioural improvements in the last couple years, and even quit smoking (minus a few lapses).  Unfortunately the consequence seems to be that he's gotten worse on a dietary level.

3. He was on Ozempic, it didn't help him and let to a lot of increased gastric issues.  He's been medically cleared of most of the issues one would look for - his sister is a doctor who advocates for him and makes sure he pushes for the tests he needs, he has worked with a gastroenterologist and he's still seeing his physician to try to resolve any issues they can.  I am fully confident that his doctor's have ruled out every horse that could be causing weight gain, they're left with looking for zebras, but again, until he can actually maintain a reasonable caloric intake they cannot truly confirm if he's gaining or holding weight in an abnormal way.

3. We live in a small town - maybe 1,700 people (a step up from the last place where the nearest village was 200!).  There is a big gym here, but it's municipal and they don't have personal trainers and the programs are only month-long one-offs with no consistency.  I would happily pay for one if there was one!  Same issue with dietitians, counselling and psychiatry - the nearest resources are almost an hour and a half drive away.  We are going to have to revisit online counselling, but we have done it in the past and find it a lot more difficult than in-person sessions.  But enough of you have insisted, so you are probably right - even something is better than nothing.

4. To those who suggested counselling - especially couples counselling - I think this is the direction I will try go in order to bring up these issues to him.  The more comments I read the more I recognize  that many of you are right - I *really* need to have this conversation with him, but I think it will be best with a mediator!  I am by no means a perfect individual and I'm worried any conversation about my issues with him will devolved into a counter-attack that I have failings as well that he isn't holding against me.

Again, thank you all for your perspectives.



Sounds awful, but I'm looking for insight on anyone who has experienced this or can provide perspective from his post of view.  I'm at my wits end and it's awful, but I don't know what I can do about it.

I am an average-to-small woman, 5'4"" and 43y.  My husband is 5'10"" 44y and almost 300lbs.  He was fit and athletic when I met him 25 years ago, but has steadily increased his weight the whole time.  We've been married 20 years, have 2 children together.  I love him, and he is a dedicated partner and parent.

The biggest problem right now is ultimately his weight.  It's gotten to a point and for long enough that I am struggling to move past the resentment of him not actively working to lose weight.  He'll try a diet until he cheats, then considers it a failure so gives up completely and goes back to eating too much.  Every time.  He drinks too much (has been a problem before, less so now, but definitely binges).  He'll try to start exercising and will go to the gym regularly for maybe 2 weeks tops, then give up that too.

This has been the pattern for years.  I try to be supportive, encourage without berating, provide healthy food at home, etc.  Fat-shaming is a criticism I want to avoid, but the reality is that this affects MY life, too, and I don't know how to cope any more.

Brutal honesty here: I'm not attracted to him any more.  At ALL.  He carries his weight in an enormous beer belly.  We cannot kiss without me having to bend over it.  I want to cry any time he hugs me because I can barely get my arms around me and certainly cannot put my head against his chest without him bending down awkwardly.  I can't watch him put shoes on, struggle to get out of bed without vivid memories of being 9 months pregnant and how much it sucked doing easy daily things with that belly.

He has severe sleep apnea, which in the last 2 years he has FINALLY begun consistently using his machine for, but even then I have to be on him like he's a child to remind him to put it on or I have to deal with the snoring and choking, which at this point just fills me with rage and resentment.

The reason I can't sleep in the same room as him anymore though, is the smell.  OMG the farts.  When I try to sleep in our room and I walk into the smell of a septic lagoon I want to cry.  And it's *all the time.* Just when I think it's safe and I'm brushing my teeth to get ready for bed I'll hear another thunderous fart.

He has massive gastric issues that he's been to the doctor for, and their only answer is it's due to his obesity.  He has chronic... loose stool, I guess, as it's not diarrhea, but it destroys the toilets and it has come to be referred to as buffalo shits.  I get so angry when I clean the bathroom and just hours later the toilet is completely plastered (that he's incapable of cleaning it up himself is another matter).

Sex is difficult, and ED is now an issue.  The quality is not important - he makes up for performance issues with skill in other ways - but the intimacy has greatly suffered.

People call it fat-shaming to blame health issues on obesity, but literally every medical issue he has would be solved by weight loss.  He did successfully lose 50 lbs 6 or 7 years ago and his sleep apnea magically vanished, only to return when he gained it back.  Even his body odour has changed to rancid.

I didn't mean for this to get so long, but context is needed.  I don't know what to do.  It's all in his hands and it doesn't mean enough to him.  I don't want to leave him because he's fat.  I love him, but I resent the fuck out of him at this point.  I want to sleep with my husband. I want to be able to snuggle up to him.  I want to be able to hug and kiss without being a contortionist.  I want to be able to have meaningful sex again without me being unable to breathe being a legitimate concern.

I've had a glimmer of what his life is like.  Long story short, I went backpacking and ended up on the return journey with a pack more than double the recommended amount more my size.  When I worked it out later, my pack was roughly equivalent to the extra weight he carries every day.  To have even just spent several hours walking and trying to do things under that weight made it so real for me, like needing to pick something up from the ground and seriously considering if it was worth it.  I wanted to cry that he carries that pack every day.  But he won't drop it, he just keeps putting more in.  And I don't want this to be my life until he dies early from it.  I honestly don't know if I could forgive him if his weight kills him.

TLDR: my husband's weight is ruining my life/our marriage and I can't talk about it without being labeled fat-shaming.  If you managed to read this all, I truly thank you.  I appreciate any insight you can provide, good or bad.",1714667397.0,thumpythrowaway567,relationships
UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido,"I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: ""You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring."" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3",1584916178.0,DemiSeren,relationships
Do I encourage him or tell him the truth?,"TLDR: I need to convince my stubborn best friend to give up on some delusion(from what I think personally) he's got about being capable of being a streamer.

I consider myself(22f) to be a relatively decent role model to my friends, one in particular (20m) who l've been friends with for about 6 years, likes to be stubborn all the way to a fault. So understand my dilemma when I'm trying to be realistic when I try to convince him about how realistically he has zero chance of becoming a popular streamer. The problem is he's set this as his goal fully and utterly for some reason and he just won't let himself be convinced otherwise. I just want him to follow a more realistic dream so he can be more likely to be happier overall in the future.

honestly hope the best of the guy and love him to death. So understand I mean genuinely no harm when I say I'm only 2 years older than him but I have quite a bit more life experience no offence, and honestly he just doesn't have the personality for it. I've done my last act of supporting him by sending his link to friends and family over the week. But no matter how frustrated he gets he'll learn I'm doing this for the better.

I need advice, how do I convince him he's convinced himself of a naive dream and get him onto a more productive path? or do you think v may not be supportive enough of him.",1724082439.0,GuavaJuice0971,relationships
How can I encourage my siblings to help my overwhelmed mum? ,"How can I (22F) encourage my siblings (21F & 17M) to help my overwhelmed mum (52F)? 

I live at home with my mum, sister, and brother. I recently moved back home after leaving a domestic violence situation and had my baby shortly after returning. We also have three dogs, which can make things pretty hectic at times. My mum works from 9 am to 3 pm, Monday to Friday. My sister is in university and is almost finished with her course, while my brother is in his second last year of high school. One of the dogs belongs to my sister, another to my mum, and the third is mine from my relationship.

My mum is starting to feel overwhelmed because she feels responsible for everything around the house: looking after the dogs, feeding them, cleaning up after them, taking them for walks, cooking, cleaning, and doing all of the laundry. My siblings only seem to help when my mum specifically asks them to do a task or if they want something for themselves. I try my best to help with cleaning or folding laundry when the baby is asleep so my mum doesn’t have to shoulder everything alone.

I feel that my siblings don’t contribute much because they’ve become accustomed to my mum doing everything for them. Sometimes I think my mum even helps too much. For example, when I had to make a phone call and felt nervous, she offered to do it for me, but I insisted it was something I needed to handle myself. I believe that because my mum does these things, my siblings lack independence.

Yesterday, my mum was really upset because my sister was supposed to keep an eye on the dogs outside to ensure they didn’t get into trouble. I was home and saw my sister sitting on the couch next to the door, occasionally knocking on the window, but she never really checked on the dogs. She even mentioned that the dogs had knocked over a plant pot, so I told her to pick it up. When my mum came home from work and went outside, she found that the dogs had dug a few holes, trampled her vegetable garden, and the plant pot my sister claimed was simply knocked over was actually broken. All my sister did was stand the pot back up and put the broken pieces inside, leaving it outside.

My brother spends most of his time in his room or with his girlfriend, and he leaves his plates on the bench instead of putting them in the dishwasher. My mum also drives out of her way to pick up his girlfriend and take her home, which is a 30-minute round trip. She asks my brother what time he wants her to take his girlfriend home, but he often doesn’t tell her, and it gets late. Then she gets herself ready for bed, and that’s usually when he asks her to take his girlfriend home. Sometimes she asks him to empty the dishwasher (he refuses to pack it because he says it’s gross), and while he does it occasionally, there are times when he doesn’t and still asks my mum for favours.

I feel terrible that my siblings don’t help out, and I wish I could do more to support my mum because she does so much for us. 

Is there anything I can do to help motivate my siblings to contribute more around the house?

**TL;DR:** My mum does everything around the house, and my siblings don’t help much. She cooks, cleans, and looks after all the dogs.",1727503567.0,Jumpy_Cause_3307,relationships
He [38/M] encouraged me [37/F] to start something... and then sited it as one of the reasons for leaving me. Now I don't enjoy it anymore.,"Hiah...

This is just one small facet of my breakup.  But I'm especially focused on it right now with two festivals coming up.  

I'm a festival vendor.  I have a regular job too.  But I do about 6 festivals a year.  I have one coming up this weekend and then another one two weeks after that.  They aren't all this close together.  

My ex, who I was with for four years was the one who encouraged me to start this.  I have a fine art degree.  And when we met I had pretty much given up on making any real living in my field, and was happy with my Quality Assurance job in an automotive plants.  He started bitching about my job... making snide comments now and then and saying how I should use my degree.  

He suggested I go and work at this place an hour away, in the city he lived in at the time.  So, I actually started looking into it.  I didn't focus just on that company, but just employment opportunities in his city in general.  His city is a lot bigger, a lot more going on there.  It wasn't just to please him, I actually started getting excited about the possibility of living and working there.  Then he told me he didn't want me to move closer to him, because he was worried I would want to spend more time with him.  

Ok... I am not the kind of woman who wants a man up my ass 24/7.  And I don't want to be up anyone's ass 24/7 either.  I'm an introvert and like my alone time.  I wouldn't have wanted us to be together all the time.  We only saw each other on the weekends.  True, maybe I might have invited him to hang out in the middle of the week or something... but I wasn't interested in spending every waking moment together.  

He also tried to say I didn't have any support system in his city and before moving there I should try to develop a support system among his friends... his friends which he didn't introduce me to for another year or so.  

This whole thing happened a year into our relationship and I still hadn't met his friends.  I know that's messed up on it's own... but anyway.

His parents, sister and brother in law... all festival vendors.  He grew up in that scene. He suggested I start selling my work at festivals.  And I did.  His family actually helped me out getting started.  The first time I worked a festival, most of my booth (except the inventory itself) was borrowed from them or given to me by them.  

He was more than happy to help me at these events.  He never acted like it was a problem.  And it's not like every weekend I'm vending.  I only worked 3 events last summer when him and I were still together.  

Well, he made the comment last winter that he wasn't looking forward to festival season this year because he didn't want to help me.  Ok, fair enough.  I hired an assistant.  

Well, when he ended the relationship in February, that was one of his reasons.  He didn't want to have to deal with me working festivals and all that, because he grew up doing that and didn't want any part of it as an adult.  He didn't seem to care that I had an assistant and he wouldn't have to help me.  

SO... last April, the breakup was still pretty fresh and my emotions were still raw then.  First big festival of the year and the biggest one I have ever worked.  It required me actually staying in a hotel for a few days and everything.  Well, my ex and I were actually supposed to meet that weekend and talk, for closure.  This wasn't going to happen at the festival, it was going to be at the hotel, the night before after I was done setting up my booth.  Well, he canceled two days before, and then said he ""might"" show up that weekend just to check out the festival.  

I asked him to let me know either way, just so I don't have to be on edge all three days.  He didn't show up and didn't let me know.  He said it was because he was working a lot and completely forgot about it.  I don't know how he could have forgotten, he told me just two days before that he was thinking about going to check it out.  I don't know but it seems like he was just fucking with my head.  

The last festival I worked, in July, was awful.  It was two days of bad organization, a rude crowd, sexual harassment, and almost no money being made.  The second day I was there before anyone else to set up because I couldn't sleep the night before.  I got there and once everything was up I sat behind my booth for an hour and cried.  

Now I have another one the day after tomorrow.  Today I was gathering up the tent and all the tables, etc... (Because now I have a pretty sweet setup, all bought and paid for on my own.)  And I started bawling while getting everything ready.  

So... bottom line is, when I started doing this I loved doing it.  Working these events made me so happy and I was glad I was finally able to make money off my art and things I made.  Now though, I just automatically associate these events with my ex and all that raw emotion starts coming back.  

I don't know why I can't get over this man.  I am still in love with him despite him treating me like garbage.  The stuff with the festivals is only one thing... there were other problems in our relationship, too.  But now every time a festival is drawing near I just get depressed and start missing him/feeling angry with him.  

I don't know if there is any advice that can be given here.  But if anyone has any words of encouragement or support, that would be so great.  Thanks in advance...

UPDATE: I got out of the friendzone,"Two years ago I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83qg15/im_m21_in_love_with_my_best_friend_f20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that I was in love with my best friend. I was encouraged to do the dangerous thing and talk to her. We had a very honest conversation and she was very sweet about it and admitted that we did have something between us but we remained friends, with not speaking for a little while to begin with. As the months went by we both started seeing other people although I was still very much in love with her. Eventually both of us realised that we didn't want other people but only each other and a short time after that we got together. We have now been dating for 10 months and we are both extremely happy and are very much in love.

Just wanted to make an appreciation post for the ones who made me talk to her and to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was, it actually is possible!

Update: Has anyone excommunicated a parent? I (25F) am about to tell the man who raised me (47M) to never contact me again. I could really use encouragement and advice.,"It's been about 6 months guys and a lot has happened. Good news is I'm confident this will be the last update I have on this. 

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43la9b/update_has_anyone_excommunicated_a_parent_i_25f/)
	
So, tl;dr of last few posts: step-father (Merle) was inappropriate (not physically) with me shortly after I turned 18. I had gotten past it but then he showed severe favoritism for his daughter (Ashley/25) of another marriage and I realized I was still hurt and was starting to see him as a bad person. I wrote him an email basically telling him I'm done. Then, he got depressed, people started taking his side and I was debating if I could try again if he got the therapy he needed for his issues. 
	
In my last post, there was a resourceful redditor who checked my post history and saw that I posted in another subreddit about our fears of him having an intimate relationship with his daughter. We had no proof, but pretty much everyone who saw them together immediately thought they were a couple and they were incredibly inappropriate together. 
	
Here is the list of things done: 
	
-Going missing late at night with no answer as to where they were
	
-Constantly going off together (like getting in a car and leaving the house)
	
-Getting caught in a pitch dark garage with claims of having a “private conversation”
	
-He would go up to her room for “back massages”, never asking his wife for such things
	
-Constantly complimenting each other in ways lovers would “You're so beautiful” and such. Keep in mind that he had stopped doing this for mom.
	
-Spending all their time together.
	
-Sleeping in the same bed often (I believe the count was 4)
	
But, the final piece to this puzzle was something my mother found. She saw Facebook messages on his phone between the two and....well honestly it was incredibly disgusting so I'm going to spare you details here, but Mom confronted the two immediately. She called Ashley every name she could think of and Merle simply denied it's context and said it was “a joke” (there was no way. An appropriate father-daugther relationship doesn't joke that way). He also erased the messages before she had a chance to get the proof saved. And, Ashley reciprocated (if not initiated) the messages and things said so there was no evidence of rape. It was consensual. 
	
Now, at this point you would think Mom would have kicked them both out, but my mother has been through a lot with Merle and was willing to be there if he was willing to admit his wrongdoings and get help. Ashley soon moved back to her home town almost 3 hours away and blamed it on my mother's treatment of her. Not even a week after she moved, Merle was up there and spending 70% of his time with her. When he came back it was hell. I talked to Mom a bit and she had the right mindframe for a little while; she spoke of psychological, mental, and emotional abuse as well as manipulation and was ready to kick him to the curb. Her sister and I were both worried of her mindframe blowing over and this being swept under the rug like literally every other scenario and we voiced these opinions to her, to which she said that wouldn't happen. She was sticking to her demands that he either seek help and own up to his faults or she was done. 
	
That house well hell for a bit. He was living in the RV in the driveway and Mom moved upstairs. They talked of therapy (he was already in therapy after my email) and spending time thinking things over. Long story short, he told her Tuesday that he wanted a divorce. She was a wreck and, I know, I don't understand it either. I think he should have been kicked out after all of this bullshit, but all she wanted was for her husband to put in the same efforts she had put in with him and given her the same love. She just wanted to be treated equal and feel cared for. 
	
He was going to stick around town, take the RV to an RV park and come back for work (he ran a small car repair business out of his garage), but yesterday he simply left. He ditched everyone and left. My brother was a wreck. Yes, my brother was an ass for what he said to me after I sent that email, but his father just abandoned him and, of all us kids, he had the closest connection to him. My brother's heart broke. Him, my mother, and everyone else was left so he could be with Ashley. 
	
Mom is in therapy (we actually ended up with the same therapist. We had 0 conversation regarding where the other was going so neither one knew that we were looking into that therapist lol. We are both perfectly okay with it and not bothered in the slightest) and I'm hopeful she will soon see that he was holding her back and making her life worse. 
	
So, as probably guessed I am not budging on my stance with him. I was being pulled in two directions about what I needed to do regarding him and it was a huge stress on me. I bluntly told my mother to stop (she did, she only said something twice but I said I needed to hear nothing for now on) and I asked my husband to stop as I needed to decide for myself. I had decided that, if he is ever in therapy for a while, admits to his faults, and gets actual help that I may be able to try again in the future, but not until he actually changed and wanted to change. As you all can probably guess, that is not happening and I have no hope left for him. I see nothing but a selfish, disgusting, manipulative, and abusive man and have no plans to make any efforts with him. My family will take time to heal, but I'm currently relieved. 
	
Tl;dr: Mom found evidence of step-father and his daughter having a sexual relationship which, after several weeks, ending in him ditching his family to be with said daughter after she had moved 3 hours away. My family is grieving, I'm celebrating and relieved. I was done with him before, but now I don't have to look at him anymore. All is well.

"How do I F30s encourage my BF M30s that he's not simply a ""trauma bond""?","
My boyfriend of 5 months, Han (M30s) is awesome . He's good looking, fun lovng, funny and kind - literally the whole package. We did start dating during a trally turbulent time in my life (its in my post history if you have several days to read a novel lol) and I was admittably going through some shit, but I always had liked him and thought he was great.


Recently my older brother got a little too overprotective and had a huge issue with Han. Usually they are BFFs but this was a really off time for my brother and he has since apologized and explaoned to Han that his anger and such was all misplaced. The problem is during this fight they had he told Han that I only dated him to trauma bond and eventually I will wise up and leave him and Han hasnt been the same since, even after my brother apologized. Han and I even talked aboit it some and I assured him, he's not a trauma bond, he's my boyfriend and we shared a lot of trauma sure but we got through it together by communicating, loving one another, and working together. I even said ""I love you"" for the first time to him and he kist didnt looked at all moved, convinced, or like he felt the same way.

I adore this man, I really think he might be the one, but rhis comment seems to be eating at him. He just keeps asking the same question in different ways as if he wants me to ""slip up"" and admit he's just a trauma bond. He's not. I kmow because I did have a trauma bond once and this is nothing like that. How can I help him understand he is my partner, and I adore him? We do have couples counseling once bi-monthly but our next appointment is in September. What do I do?

"My (27F) friend (27F) of over 12 years wouldn't accept finals as my reason to not attend her out of state Bachelorette party. I agreed to make it work, but now there's absolutely no plan even though its in 4 days and I'm starting to feel bitter.","\*\*EDIT: Wow, I had no idea that this would get as much traction as it has. I wish I could go and thank each of you for your thoughtful comments, but time isn't really something I have a ton of right now ;) And for those of you who said you relate, might I encourage reading ""Boundaries"" by Cloud & Townsend. Obviously this is still a huge struggle for me, but I'm thankful for the example others who have figured it out can set for us ""people pleasers"".

One of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's ""busy"", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave.

The party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan.

Originally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say?

TL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say.",1564400437.0,twdfnl77,relationships
My [23 F] boyfriend [25 M] of 1 year encouraged me to go sleep with other men. I'm confused.,"Basically, my boyfriend and I have recently had mismatched libidos, in that he'll only want sex about once a week, whereas I'd be happier if it was more often. I had a discussion with him about this today.

He said that I should go sleep with other guys. Random or not, doesn't matter. He said that he wants me to be happy, and if I would be happy having more sex, then it would be selfish of him to stop me. (This isn't a fetish, he doesn't want to hear about it or know if I actually do it).  

That's not really how it works in my head. I see sex as something intimate (although I get how other people could see it as something purely physical, I'm not that kind of person). I'm also a bit upset that he would encourage me to have sex with someone else. For some reason I think that if he *really* loved me, he wouldn't want any other man to have me. But he doesn't see it that way.

When he was younger, he spent many years not in a relationship and having a lot of casual sex, so I think that's kind of 'warped' (for lack of a better word) his perspective. He thinks sex is as meaningful as kissing a stranger in a bar and never seeing them again. 

Essentially, I'm confused about how to react, and what to think. Part of me is suspicious of him possibly cheating, but I have no idea. 

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for your replies - I have read every single one of them. I'll post an update if anything changes/anything interesting happens.

My [24 M] flatmate's [21 M] skin condition and hygiene are affecting everyone in the flat. How can we encourage him to change his habits in as considerate and understanding a way as possible?,"There are three guys sharing a flat – myself (24), Tom (23), and 
Josh (21). We get on great and have a mostly fantastic time living together. We communicate openly and honestly about pretty much everything, so any household issues are dealt with quickly and amicably, if they even arise at all.

Josh is unfortunate enough to suffer from a genetic skin condition called psoriasis. It causes him a significant amount of discomfort and irritation and is visible enough that he is quite self-conscious about it. Tom and I were aware of his condition before we all moved in together and both make an effort to be as supportive and understanding as possible to Josh, especially when it's getting him down.

One of the effects of psoriasis is that the sufferer's skin produces new cells faster than the body can destroy the old ones, resulting in a near constant shedding of dandruff-like flakes. I can't even begin to imagine how upsetting and difficult this must be for Josh – almost everything he owns is covered in these flakes, and something as simple as visiting someone else's house must be a nerve-rackingly self-conscious experience. I would expect that trying to keep on top of cleaning the flakes up must feel very disheartening and futile too, due to their incessant production.

Given all this, I really do not feel good about considering the impact Josh's condition is having on my own lifestyle. After all, he is genuinely struggling with it on a daily basis. However, there are a few small issues that over time have become less easy to overlook. I want to figure out how to deal with them as sensitively and constructively as possible so that we can continue living together happily, and above all continue being open and honest with one another. So, I’ve come to you /r/relationships to ask for some advice. The key issues are:

* The flakes end up everywhere. Everyone who visits the flat leaves with a visible amount attached to their clothes, bag, etc. Those of us that live here find them on and in every floor and surface, all our clothes and belongings, our beds, and even sometimes our food. As it stands, Tom and I vacuum and wipe them up as often as we can. This doesn’t eliminate the problem by any means, but it definitely makes a big difference. Staying on top of it does mean vacuuming at least once, sometimes twice a day, though, and currently Josh doesn’t contribute at all to this effort. I don’t want to suggest that Josh should be taking full responsibility for this – it is in no way his fault that we have this extra cleaning to do – but I do feel it would be fair for him to pitch in.

* Josh has decided to forego the conventional medical treatments for psoriasis, opting instead to use a number of herbal supplements and moisturisers. He seems very happy with his current treatment plan, and says it gives him considerable relief from his symptoms, which I think is fantastic. He usually applies his various creams in the morning after his shower. I know this because when I enter the bathroom after him, this stuff is everywhere – there are usually dollops of it on the floor, taps & handles are coated with it, and the toilet lid is usually covered in a layer, and a lot of the aforementioned dead skin. I usually spend a couple of minutes wiping it all up, which is, in all honesty, a very minor inconvenience, yet I still feel the considerate thing for Josh to do would be to clean it up himself. This is more of a problem when guests are staying, particularly those who aren’t aware of Josh’s condition.

* Unconnected to his condition, Josh has a very strong, very distinctive smell. It is difficult to describe, but it is not typical body odour. It’s also not always entirely unpleasant – before moving in together, I just saw Josh’s unique aroma as a distinctive quirk. Now, though, the entire flat is filled with this smell, to the point that guests almost universally comment when they come through our front door. It also seems that Josh’s personal hygiene has gradually been slipping, and so the smell has taken on an acrid quality. Recently this has meant that it’s difficult to use the bathroom immediately after him as it’s so pungent, and being invited into Josh’s room is a very unpleasant experience. It’s the sort of smell that clings to clothes, too, and a few people have pointed out to Tom and me in recent months that we “smell like Josh”. Save for burning incense and opening windows, there doesn’t seem to be a lot Tom and I can do about this. I have no idea how to open a dialogue with Josh about such a personal subject, or if it is even my place to do so.

As I’m sure is clear, these are all issues that could be solved with some communication. Tom and I have discussed these briefly and it seems we are both in agreement that a small shift in habits on Josh’s part could lessen their impact on everyone in the flat, so it is clear we need to have a conversation. It is just made more complicated by their personal nature and Josh’s condition – none of this is Josh’s fault and the last thing I want is for him to feel like it is. So, guys, I turn to you for advice.

How can Tom and I initiate a conversation in which we suggest that Josh:

a) help clean up the skin flakes  
b) clean up the bathroom after applying his treatment  
c) put more effort into his personal hygiene

in a sensitive and considerate way, without leaving him feeling blamed or attacked?

I would also love to hear from anyone who has suffered with psoriasis themselves, or has lived with someone who has. Have you had a similar conversation? How did it go?

On the other hand, if you feel I’m being unreasonable, please do let me know.

Thank you so much!

I (28F) am getting a courage to break up with my bf (254M),"*edit*  I am 28F and he is 24M 🥲 sorry folk, he's not a vampire

We have dated for almost 4 years. We're on and off for a month but last week we were really good. He called and text all the time. He was so cute and sweet. But suddenly, this weekend 'things' happened. On Friday we were happy like usual, then after Friday evening he seemed strange. No reading text and reply, miscall and not call back until early Sat (3am) he said it was late but talk later *heart* 

That was the last time he replied my texts. Then all Saturday He didn't answer the phone, he read my text but didn't reply, so I didn't send anymore. Then I saw a girl likes his pic on IG, and turn out they just followed each other, I don't know when. This kind of thing happen before, and I'm so scared.

Now, it's Sunday, he still didn't reply my Saturday's text. And didn't answer my call on IG, seen but didn't call back.

It made me think what did I do wrong to deserve this. I cried non stop (by myself) with confusion because we were good for the whole week till Friday and now he just completely ignored me. It really hurt, really really hurt. Now I have a bit of sense and I just want to just ghost him, block him, or something that could hurt him. 

But I also want it to end well...it's quite stupid that part of me still want to hear his excuse...and I know he's going to call soon. I don't want to pick up tbh but I'm so scared of my weak self. 

I know I should let this person go, since what he did is really quite cruel. But you know, when a person is too deep in love, I just so scared of myself since his smiley face always make me dont want to lose it. I may overthinking this. Please kindly advice. Also, if breaking up, how should I write a break up email? If I ghost him, he will use that to blame me for sure. I kinda don't want that.

Tldr- Out of the blue, from a happy Friday, my bf doesn't reply my texts, and call for the whole Sat, I found he just followed a girl and she likes all his pics (I didnt confront him). And I called him on IG one more time on Sun he saw but still didn't call back or reply (Sunday evening now). I feel so confused and sad.

"Don't understand what customer [m/early 20s] hopes to achieve in pestering me [f/27] for almost a year, and how best to encourage him to stop?","For about a year now, this guy has come into the shop I work in almost every day. At first I just thought he was a guy who needed to buy a lot of stuff, but then a few months ago he basically ran out of small items to buy and it became apparent he was really just coming into the store to speak to me. By this point, as is normal practice with regular customers, I'd already told him my name and been perfectly friendly to him for a few months. 

This is usually what happens: he will walk in, stand by the till and refuse service from anyone else, until he gets the chance to speak to me. I'll ask him what he wants and he'll say 'oh nothing, I just dropped in to say hi' and then will try to force an awkward conversation. He can't remember how to pronounce or spell my name from when I told him months ago (it's an unusual one) and tries to ask for clarification often, which I fob off with excuses like 'it's fine, nobody says it right, just call me whatever'. He's tried, in various awkward, forced ways, to 'casually' ascertain my facebook details, tried to find out the name of my band (it's a guitar shop so most of us are in bands), where I hang out, what gigs I'm going to be at, my soundcloud, etc. I am a poor liar and when on the spot I panic and never think of something stern to say in reply such as 'I don't give out my facebook details to customers', but instead deflect these questions by mumbling things like 'I never use facebook' or 'I never go out; yup, I'm boring'.

He also will stare at my crotch and/or boobs if he thinks I'm not looking; this has resulted in me putting on a baggy jumper every time I see him come into the store which nonetheless does not stop him from trying to stare through it. Recently I've been staring him down pretty hard when talking to him and not breaking eye contact, which for the most part seems to control his staring (although I can see him having to control himself to stop himself from looking). Additionally he doesn't behave this way with other women that work in the store, so presumably it's a bit of a crush or something.

I've shoehorned in that I have a boyfriend, and also when it became apparent that he was coming in to talk to me I became quite abrupt and non-conversational with him. Obviously, being a customer/employee relationship there's only so much I can do to communicate with him that I'm not interested in speaking to him. 

I assumed it would drop off when it was clear I was not interested, but it's gone on for so ridiculously long now that I feel I'll have to do something else to discourage him. I don't want to be mean, or rude, or embarrass him; he's obese, has a lisp, English isn't even his first language and he's so socially awkward, sometimes I can see him forcing fake confidence. I feel his actions are probably born out of loneliness and sexual frustration rather than being some kind of genuine asshole, so unkindness is probably not what he needs. What I'd really like to understand is what the fuck he thinks he's doing? Has anyone else been 'this guy' in their lives and can explain what he hopes to achieve by pestering me? Doesn't he understand that it's awkward and unwelcome? Does he think over time I'll warm to him?? 


TL;dr - customer at the shop I work has been pestering me for almost a year, want to understand his mindset and what he hopes to achieve, and also how to make him stop without being a dick to him and maybe even helping him be less of a fucking wind-up to women in the future.",1356714500.0,throwawaything12,relationships
My (31m) wife (34f) is ghosting our marriage,"My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we’ve never had a lack of affection, but that she’s unhappy and she’s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left. 

We’ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren’t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn’t meet somebody else. We’ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She’s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me. 

All I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I’ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she’s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I’m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   

She’s not only pushing me out but she’s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I’ve been able to gather from mutual friends she’s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she’s at it because she’s micromanaging everyone. 

Since she left I’ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won’t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it’ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can’t convince her that there doesn’t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren’t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can’t see any of it and I’m afraid she’s completely ignoring what she’s doing by working so much she can’t think about anything else. 

I hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife’s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she’s not acting like herself but they can’t say anything to her or she’ll push them out too. It’s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.

I keep telling myself it’s going to be ok, she’s going to realize she doesn’t have to do this, but it’s been 20 days and I’m starting to lose hope. I don’t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can’t do on my own, but I can’t leave because I’m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of “us” and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. 

Tl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me.

Edit -
I think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.

I've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this.

The problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too.

I also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them.

Also -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard. I thought we were good at communicating to one another but apparently I thought wrong or something changed and took that communication with it and I didn't see it.",1556536242.0,uneasypeasy,relationships
"I 25F waiting to have surgery, How can I encourage 26M boyfriend to help me around the house?","I am 25F, My boyfriend is 26M. We have been together happily since August w/ virtually no issues in our relationship until recently. I am currently in the midst of health crisis that requires urgent surgery. My health situation has been rendering me pretty useless, yet somehow Im still acting like superwoman every single day. I am in level 6-8 pain daily, on a 5lb weightlifting restriction, cant even bend down & im still working full time, all while caring for our home & my four cats. If things dont get done around the house, I still *have to* do them myself. I have OCD & childhood trauma from my upbringing being within a hoarder home. I like clean, non cluttered environments, Its the only way I can properly function. My boyfriend is aware of this.


Last week, We got into a heated argument. It started when I said I need some help around the house. His excuse was that “If I needed help, I could have just asked” & “I can’t read your mind”, was one of his main focus points. I told him I dont understand why I have to do everything myself around the house, yet ASK for the help I need when its obviously things that need done in day-to-day living. He claimed that he will change his behavior toward these things, to the point it will be impressive to me. I have not seen this from him quite yet. However, I have noticed since this argument that he has done the dishes once. I am still doing everything else around the house. I have still been sweeping up, caring for the pets, etc.  Despite everything with my health, If I don’t specifically ask, I *still* wont receive. I am starting to feel like a live-in maid due to this dynamic. I believe this is due to him enjoying most of his freetime video gaming, while I am in poor health cleaning (when I should be resting.) I absolutely cannot settle my mind, or “just let the house go” as my OCD will quickly crumble my wellbeing. I dont appreciate being forced into wife duties as a girlfriend. I was looking for a partnership and I feel like I dont really have that. I am mostly on my own during this surgery/recovery process unless he proves otherwise I guess. 



TL;DR I am awaiting surgery, in very poor health. My boyfriend of 1 year has not been much help around the house, unless I ask for the help. This caused an argument last week, where he promised help that I have not yet seen. If he isn’t willing, I pick up the slack despite my health.",1719855563.0,Royal_Virus_4411,relationships
Outgrowing my husband (27),"We’ve been high school sweethearts, did long distance, moved out, pets, got married, bought a house, the whole shindig. There was a time i was madly in love with this guy and couldn’t think how id be otherwise. 

Well during covid my husband found out he has “curly” hair. Its actually a ball of matted fluff with some wave to it, but sure it was news to us so we grew it out, tried curly products and all that, i encouraged it. But now its this greasy mop that sits atop his head. Mind you his hygiene is rough too. We recently had to have a talk about showering more than once a week, which he complied with for about that week. I along with his family and my mom have gently told him it looks horrid (think cynthia from rugrats or rick from rick and morty) and to consider at least a trim. It honestly smells bad too and it pisses me off every time it gets on me. Now he has me putting clips in it so i have to rummage through the grease to pull it out of his face. 

The last few months ive become less and less attracted to him and started noticing other things that i cant seem to unnotice that has always been there but now i cant get past it like before. Like his nasty ass grown out toe nails with gunk under it (its apparently my duty to cut it? Hes waiting on me to trim his toes) or that he’s been dieting to loose weight and now he looks like a fragile sick man (he’s healthy but loves the frail look). Atop all the physical stuff, theres the usual “mental” stuff like wont initiate or plan dates and taking him anywhere means dragging him or giving him a pep talk before hand to not ruin my day, needs to be told everything that needs to get done around the house, wont listen when i approach him with these things or will work on it for about a day or a few and revert back. 

I get that it’s pretty dramatic but it’s not just the hair. I do think it led me to being grossed out enough to take a step back to assess the situation. 

Now it feels like i’m older and know what i want in a man which is a spontaneous, high energy, social butterfly, healthy, gym loving dude type but i went with the complete opposite because i was young and in love and he’s genuinely a good dude, just not what i want in a man at this phase in life anymore. On a day to day I keep it calm and mellow and try to get through it without loosing my cool but some days I just cant stand looking at that hair and everything else that comes with it and it pisses me off. Im sure to him it seems like I’m bipolar or mad at nothing but it feels like im mad at everything all at once if the wind blows wrong. 

Is this normal? Ive been exposed to couples that stay together but seem like they just gotten worn down from each other my whole life, i don’t want that. Is there any way to fix it since talking to him doesn’t work? He’s a great dude in many departments, better than most, but at the very least i just want him to just grow up and show his full potential. I get that the hair makes him happy but cmon.. it’s not just about the hair. 

TL;DR: 12 years into a relationship and realizing that I may be out growing my husband. Hygiene is what made me take a step back to see all the other issues. At this point in my life I crave a guy with different qualities and am wondering how to make things work out. 

Edit: hi! Lots of traction here.. lots to think about too. I guess my main question here is: How do I communicate these issues with someone who is very set on their ways and not the best at receiving feedback? ",1720614451.0,parrotmomforlife,relationships
"My BF (25M) is encouraging me to work harder to join him in the lifestyle he wants but I (25F) don’t know if I can and also don’t want to/can’t bear losing him, what can I do?","-insert typical throwaway spiel-

For some context, my boyfriend, “Todd”, came from a low to middle class background but is very smart and a hard worker in his own right. Well, long story short, he put in an insane amount of effort and time in the last two years and has made it into the job he wanted for a while. I’m talking 7am wake-up/work/study/network until 11pm every day consistently kind of work hard. The job pays him roughly $200,000 annually (before tax); I do ok for myself and make close to $70,000 . The thing is, he works crazy hours, I would say on average for the last 4 months ~80 hours/week while I just work the standard 35-40 hours a week. That being said, he’s on route to cracking a million dollars in the next 5-10 years given his profession and willingness to work those hours (not worth it in my opinion, especially since he’ll still be working ~50 hours at least by 30)

Well, Todd is truly one of the nicest guys ever, despite those hours really drilling into him and him constantly being on call. The thing is, he’s really gently encouraging and prodding me to get a graduate school education or some sort of certification (we both graduated from the same university in the same program) in order to propel myself further in my career. I really like my current job though and while the room for growth is quite limited, I wouldn’t mind making ~$100,000 by 30. His rationale is that he’s always wanted to live certain “high-lifestyle” by his 40’s and not that I don’t want it, it’s just I don’t want to work so hard. I know he supports me and loves me a lot but it’s getting tough because I want to meet his expectations and I don’t want to disappoint him. I know most people will tell me to just be myself and tell him how I feel but I don’t want to lose him. 

Is there any other way around this? Thanks a lot guys, just been on my mind for a while and it hasn’t really blown up. It’s just something I want to address earlier on right now.

Edit/addition as suggested - It’s important to mention that he does own our house and he pays for essentially all living expenses. I have offered to pay before but he has never even entertained that thought and even got a bit upset when I asked. He is more traditional in that aspect so I feel his desire for me to propel my career forward aligns with what many of you said, that he wants a “power couple” vibe to us. At least to a point where we can fuel each other’s ambitions and where I have a higher trajectory for growth. I completely get this mindset though as a lot of our couple friends are like this and he hasn’t been demanding it, more so encouraging it. Thanks a lot for the help so far guys, really really appreciate it :)

"My (36M) wife (34F) gave up a high paying, high stress job for a lower paying job that she enjoys. Now she feels like she doesn’t “contribute” enough in our relationship. How can I help her get past this?","My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been together for 5 years, married for 3, and have no children.  For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn’t like more money… hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house.

Once the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she’s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it.

The thing is, every once in a while, she’ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn’t “contribute” because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.

She recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn’t use it.  I felt terrible…

I’m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I’ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I’m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She’s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job.

I was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I’m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don’t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I’d love to hear how you dealt with it.

Thank you!

TLDR: My wife’s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn’t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I’m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share.

&#x200B;

Edit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I’d try to explain here:

Why did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)? 

While she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn’t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time. 

Can she increase her hours from 15 to XX? 

Without going into much detail, her job essentially gives her “tasks” each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she’s kind of maxed out where she’s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week.",1572287081.0,TAyepyepyep,relationships
I can’t get encouragement from my bf of two years.,"I’m 30 and he is 33. 

We met when I was in a really bad place and he gave me tons of encouragement and helped me out a lot. He convinced me to go out with him. 

I thought that was how he is, but that encouraging attitude changed to being critical. I understand compassion can get exhausted, especially for someone as hardworking as him. 

We don’t go on dates, I don’t get romanced, and I do not ask for anything. Latest I’ve been asking for some kind words and his mentality is *fuck that*, he’s going to be realistic. 

I’ll try to be optimistic about my circumstances and he will throw out any optimism so fast. For example, going back to school. He’ll remind me I dropped out before and it’s not realistic. 

He seems to get frustrated when I turn to him, so I mostly keep to myself, even with good news. It’s often met by *ok…*. There’s no sense of having a partner. 

I’m just sad and tired. I’ve tried to explain this to him and he starts getting heated. I’ve recently resolved to hanging up when this happens. I know this isn’t good for either of us, but how can I improve the situation while still in it?

[Update] Ex [42F] is creating so much drama in my[37M] life that I am having trouble coping. Considering giving up my kids just to get it all to stop.,"I was looking in my profile and saw my post in this subreddit from 7 years ago, as my Ex was causing so much chaos that I was doubting everything. That post is linked here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/ScafVaff3L

I took everything to heart and implemented several things right away. I became a grey rock… and started documenting my ass off. 
I consulted my lawyers, and they said they advised several steps. The first of which was a 730 evaluation. (This is an evaluation done by a psychologist) that process took a really long time as the 730 evaluator got very sick halfway through.  That took 10 months. At the end the report essentially read “Mom is volatile and disorganized and that dad’s home would be a more stable home for the children. However, there is hope that mom is starting to improve, so if things are still bad in 1 year it would be appropriate to change custody to dad”

This was a tough pill to swallow. Things were not better, and the chaos was just intermittent. So we just kept documenting, and doing our thing. Eventually, we started getting a lot of emails from teachers that Jill in particular, was often not bathed, never had her homework done, didn’t have school supplies and that she was falling way behind in her studies. We applied for a trial to review custody, and asked for primary custody to be swapped to us. That was at the end of 2019, and trial was set for May 2020. 

So as you can imagine, once COVID hit, everything got delayed. There was a large amount of events in 2020. COVID shut down. Donna and I had a child, Rebecca. And then my Ex started denying visitation to Jill and Marvin. Every 2 weeks I would go down… wait in front of the house. No kids would emerge. Sometimes I would have the police come, not to force anything, but to get the documentation in terms of a case number. This went on for 4 months, before I was able to start getting visitation again.

Eventually, the trial was set for summer of 2021 and went for 3 days and I had over 500 pages of documentation. Day 1 was entirely testimony from the Co-Parenting therapist we had been seeing for 5 years. She testified that my Ex was the most difficult client she had ever worked with in her career, that my ex never followed a single agreement in session, and that she was a pathological liar.

Last day of testimony was my ex, where she was caught lying on the stand, and was presented with evidence that she had been secretly taking the children to a medical professional for 2 years that I had explicitly not agreed to.

So starting in Aug 2021, the judge ordered the kids come live with me, primary custody and limiting my ex to 4 days a month. 

It’s now been 3 years: When Jill was in 5th grade she had a 26% in math, and a 40% in English. For the last 3 years, she has maintained a 4.0 every single year, and will be starting High School in Honors Geometry, Honors English and AP Biology.

Marvin has also been doing well also and just finished his first year of middle school with a 4.0 GPA, and is loving his coding and robotics elective.

They have new clothes, and have learned new skills and responsibilities. Donna has been crucial in setting up patterns to help with success in school. Their rooms are both immaculate, and they are the ones doing it with very little direction from us. They are happy and finally involved in activities and sports.

Our little Rebecca adores them both, and I will often find all 3 of them cuddled up together as one of the older two reads a book to her.

Jill made the decision recently to stop going on visits to her mom. The chaos and drama started being directed at her… along with lack of food, clothes that fit, etc. Marvin is still going for visits and we are encouraging that as long as he is feeling safe there. 

All in all things are going so well and the kids are doing incredible. There are hard moments still, but it has all been worth it, and we are able to shield them for the most part from any chaos their mom may want to start. 

If anyone is reading this that initially sent advice. Thank you. When you are in the thick of it, it is tough to not feel like it is impossible and you will never be able to overcome it. I needed the outside prospective.

Well, as a likely shock to no one, we (me, 30F and him, 29M) broke up. It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn’t meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us. 

Ultimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle.

I am sad, mourning ending the relationship, and feeling bad for hurting someone I care about. Frustrated that it was so messy, that it didn't work out, etc... just taking things a day at a time and trusting that I made the right choice (which is hard when there's no answer key for life to check against.)

UPDATE: My (29M) soon to be ex-husband seems to feel entitled to another chance with me (28F).,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gklndb/my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Well, turns out my gut instincts were right. The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass. 

 I thank the universe every day that he is no longer connected to me in a romantic way. It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy. 

To anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden.

My 32F son (15m) asked his dad to move permanently with him. ,"I, 32F, had my first child when I was a dumb 17 years old teenager and not even out HS. His father, 33M, I were on and of for most of teenager years, during pregnancy and for my son first year of life. I really wanted things to work out between us but it never happened. By the time my son was one, I was admitted at my dream college on the other side of the country. My parents are very well off and encouraged me to pursue higher education while supporting both of us. The paid for my full education, accommodation, my son's daycare etc my only job was being a mom and study full time for the first year my mom moved with me to help me settle. I know I was extremely lucky and privileged.  

In order to move with my son, his dad granted me full custody in exchange for not paying child support and agreeing to fly once on Christmas to be with us and I will fly to our hometown during summer. 

So that have been our life. I graduated from college, got a job and provided for my son. His dad only saw him a total of 4/5 weeks every year. Eventually I married and have a daughter that was born with a malformation in her hearst and needed surgery, this happened on 2019. So being between giving birth, having a sick child and COVID I wasn't unable to go for my home for the first time and my ex wasn't able to fly either on Christmas. On summer 2021 I was due to give birth and flying wasn't a choice. So I helped my son's dad with money so could come instead. Again on 2022 I was unable to fly, then again I gave my ex the money to come. 

Last year, my son asked if he could go alone to his dad. It's something I knew it was going to happen, I knew he will grow up and would want to meet his dad on his own terms. So I agreed and he has a blast, he asked again last Christmas and Summer the same thing. 

Since he came back last time I noticed something had changed on him. He always loved his dad and I always encouraged him. Probably due the all the changes in last few years (my marriage, pregnancies, him entering his teenage years) he started to log his dad. I noticed they were talking more and more often and knew it was becoming painful to him to know hi has a dad on the other side of the country but also not knowing what to have a dad is. So when 2 days ago he came to me and said he wanted to be live his dad, that he asked his dad about it and he has said yes I wasn't all that surprised. I was hurt. I was nauseous. I cried a lot privately. But I knew this was going to happen somehow, anytime. 

This morning I texted my son's dad about what my son told. He was very casual and chill. So I asked what his plan was (education, housing etc) and since he has already talked to my son and said yes. He backpedalled. He asked how I could be so eager to kick my own son out. I clarified as long as live my house will be his house too but if he wanted to be with his dad I wasn't gonna stop him. He said every kind of things that hurt me a lot: that I wanted to play house with my husband and daughters.  That I grew tired of be my son's mom. That once he has him, he would make sure my son saw me how I truly was, and many many more things. In the end said if you don't want to be a father to him for the first time in 15 years just said so and stop attacking me. He never replied.

I have to now look my son in the eyes and explain him why he can't move out to be with his dad and try to him to not to hate me. Honestly I never had such a big burden as a mom than to break the reality on 15 years old son about someone he worships. 

How do I have this talk to him? What can I possibly said to make things worst?

UPDATE My (26F) ex boyfriend (27M) and roommate (25F) are still hanging out and it's bothering me.,"Here is a [LINK TO ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/epmnay/my_26f_ex_boyfriend_27m_and_roommate_25f_are/) In summary, my ex and my roommate decided that they will continue to hang out together. 

So, the past week has been really hard for me. I am thankful that my boss is giving me 2 days off to recover and get back on my feet. Forty-eight hours after the breakup, I talked to my roommate and she said that while she understands how I feel, she will continue hanging out with him. I also talked to my ex and told him how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. He also said he understands, but thinks it's controlling of me to ask them not to hang out. Last week, they hung out for 5 days, for hours on end. They did respect my requests not to come inside the house when together, which I appreciate. 

Many posters suggested that they were having an affair. My ex claims that he did not break up with me to get with her. I did believe him at first, and maybe it was somewhat true, but I now think that something is going on and was going on. I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. Turns out I was onto something. I suspect they are now trying to hide their relationship from me, though I cannot be sure.

Two days ago, I told my roommate that I no longer think it is healthy for me to live with her. She was fine with this and is asking around for places to stay. I will also consider leaving if she cannot leave. The most crushing thing about all this is that the two of them were people I considered best friends. This is also happening LESS THAN 2 weeks after the break up. It feels weird and rude to me. Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. Maybe in time I'll be happy for them. 

TLDR; Ex and roommate hanging out still, I suspect something is going on and now they're hiding it from me.


Edit: you all are so kind! Thanks for the words of encouragement, tough love, and shared experiences. I am staying with a friend tonight and am hoping that the move-out situation goes smoothly. Living apart from my current roommate is the only viable option for me, moving forward. I will also be cutting contact from both of them as soon as the living situation is settled. 

I am going to therapy tomorrow, and went last week, so I’m hoping that helps. I am so thankful I have off from work. It’s been nice to just be able to rest.

[UPDATE] My (20f) friend (21f) is going to great lengths to ‘prove’ that my boyfriend (24m) is cheating even though I know he isn’t,"Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q10gs/my_20f_friend_21f_is_going_to_great_lengths_to/

So I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life’s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me.

After posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over.

… Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily’s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a ‘home wrecker’. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I’d been cheating on Sam and how I’d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he’d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend’s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn’t in the flat… I was celebrating Sam’s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven’t had any other messages from him since.

Emily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can’t say I saw anything, but I also can’t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I’ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be ‘free’ from our partners but she knew I wouldn’t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own ‘abusive’ relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off.

I didn’t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we’re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I’m breaking my lease, and I’m going to spend the night in a friend’s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I’ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision.

Also a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn’t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to ‘I know he’s not cheated on me with Emily’, but I do know he didn’t. He never contacted Emily privately, and was really only friendly to her because she was my housemate. Sam was just as unlikely to cheat with Emily as I was with any of his friends, family or housemates. I know some of you may still think that he could still have cheated/cheat in the future and I can’t definitively say he didn’t/won’t, but I’m not going to ruin my relationship with ‘what if’ style thoughts.

TL;DR - Housemate who was trying to prove to me that my boyfriend was cheating was actually cheating on her boyfriend and wanted me to ‘join in’ by convincing me to dump my boyfriend. Found out from her boyfriend, who had been told that I was the one telling her to cheat on him (I wasn’t). I’m moving out as quickly as my legs will let me.",1529408591.0,FriendConflict54,relationships
"My friend [26F] introduced me [27F] to her good friend [29M], encouraged us to date, and is now upset with me for actually dating him","One of my good friends (we'll call her Jan) introduced me to her good friend (call him John) about a year ago. We had good conversation and chemistry, but he had a bit too much to drink and he ended up going home with another girl in our group. Jan was really upset about him going home with her, and I assumed it was because she liked him. I asked her about it and she said she definitely didn't have feelings for him, she was upset because it was a girl she didn't particularly care for, who is known for hooking up with a lot of guys. She said she wouldn't have been mad if it was any one else he ended up going home with, just not that one girl. 


I didn't see him again until Jan invited him to a party 2 months later. After the party, he asked her for my number. She told me he liked me, and that I should go for it. I asked her a couple more times if she was sure she didn't like him and she said they were definitely just friends and she didn't like him that way. 


So John and I started texting a lot, we went on a couple of dates but never crossed the friend line. I wasn't very emotionally available at that time, I wasn't over an ex that I still hung out with a lot and I didn't want to make anything awkward with Jan by going for it with John when I knew it wasn't likely to work out with him. So I told him that and we continued texting once in a while, but didn't see each other after that. 


I ended up getting back together with my ex (big mistake) for a couple of months. That ended poorly and I was single again. Jan was there for me, she helped me through my newly single and sad phase. We went out to the bars and helped give me confidence again, talked about horrible dating experiences, etc. Jan and I got a lot closer through this. Even through this time we talked about John and again, she made it clear that she was not interested in him as anything more than a friend.


3 months later, John came out with us. We really clicked. I started thinking about how sweet he was to me and how much we kind of just made sense together. He asked me out and I said yes. I told Jan, to make sure and her response was that she was okay with it, but we couldn't talk about him the way we had talked about other guys. I wasn't totally sure what she meant by that, but I assumed it was the horror stories of dating, or just making fun of guys for doing weird or awkward things. 


Every time I brought him up after that she kind of avoided or changed the subject which I thought was weird. I know they had been hanging out a lot (they are neighbors) and she and I had been hanging out a lot, but it seemed like she didn't want to mix us. She and I also hang out at least once per week usually. 


On Friday I invited her to do something with me, she said yes, then I told her that John was coming too. She said she didn't want to hang out with the two of us so she wasn't coming. I asked what she meant by that (to see if she meant she didn't want to be a third wheel) and she never responded. 


I haven't heard from her since, but she has been talked to John some. They even went out for dinner in a group the night she texted me to tell me she didn't want to hang out with us, after confirming I wasn't there. Then yesterday I was at his house, and she had to drop by to get something she left there. When she came in and saw me she didn't even acknowledge my presence.


I don't understand how she went from being encouraging of it, to being okay with it, to just avoiding it, and now she seems to be pissed at me, simply for inviting her to do something with the two of us. I have no idea what to do in this situation either. If it were the other way around I would try to be encouraging, even if I didn't think it would work out. I wouldn't be passive aggressive or make my friends stop doing something that makes them happy because it makes me uncomfortable. Or I would talk about it with them. I don't think she's being fair but I also don't want to lose a friend.


**tl;dr**: My friend sort of set me up with her friend. It didn't work out at first. Now it is, and she is pissed that we are actually dating.

UPDATE: My wife of 15+ years friend-zoned me and wants no intimacy.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1eVrSXL54L

I wanted to give you guys an update of how the therapy session with my wife went this week. Not sure if this is helpful or not but I took many of the responses/comments/suggestions from my initial post and put together some things I wanted to discuss with our couples therapist to help us navigate some of the core issues that may be affecting this situation. 

One of the main things that is the ""buzz word"" of this has been the term ""resentment"" and it has been really eating me up inside knowing my wife keeps telling me she doesn't know why she's resentful or doesn't know why this is affecting her emotionally/mentally. I brought this up with our therapist once again and resurfaced the conversation about being married for so long (15yrs) and being together since we ere 14yrs old. Our long history of growing up and how having children when she was 19yrs old (me 20) significantly changed the trajectory of our lives. We experience sever poverty and many hardships in the process and we essentially had zero social life for the past 10 years because we were so busy raising babies (2 kids now ages 12 &14). She followed up with tons of questions directly mostly at my wife about her feelings towards this and 90% of the responses were very ""our kids"" focused. It definitely felt like she was afraid of saying ""yes it sucked"" because she would feel guilt or shame because it would imply she regrets the kids. I mentioned this in  the session and the therapist encouraged her to look at this outside of the lens of being a mother and to try to view it a bit more selfishly and individually and it was very eye opening. My wife mentioned that she was very frustrated with the fact that we did miss out on many things in life. She also was very clear in saying ""I do not think I missed out on other partners or dating or partying but I certainly lost all my friends."" This was huge because one of the big pieces that has caused a strain in our lives is how silo'd and isolated we've been (again busy raising kids). I followed up by reminding her that it's important to have good friends and to make time for herself and her friendships. 

For the past 3+ years, we've had multiple conversations about friends and how it is important to have them in life. Specially when you have similar peers that can help in many areas of life that perhaps we have no experience navigating and even simply for enjoyment. It has always been something my wife avoids, even  though she's always been someone who needs that external stimuli. The main reason for her not investing in friends or even herself has always been ""the kids."" Like I mentioned earlier in this post, 90% of the answers have to relate to ""the kids"" to some degree. 

At this point in our session I started to feel like there was a common denominator (the kids) in most of the frustrations and problems she was experiencing. So I simply asked her ""Do you think you may be upset at me because I'm responsible for these kids in the sense that I got you pregnant so young?"" I wasn't ready but she said that she was upset at me for that. She also followed up with the fact that she knows that's unreasonable because it ""takes 2 to tango."" I did feel like it was progress because it kind of gave us something to work on and help alleviate some of these ""burdens"" so we agreed to invest more time in nurturing good friendships both together and individually. 

Towards the end of the session, we began to discuss what actionable items we would take from this session. At this point, it was still all very ambiguous and blurry as to what the outcomes were. I was very direct and very forward in asking my wife what her plan is moving forward. (NOTE: I had decided prior to the session that should my wife say the same thing about being a coparenting roommate that I would take the 180 approach and essentially do me) She started basically saying the same thing, that she doesn't have any desire to be intimate or sexual with me as of now and that she loves me immensely and she feels bad for not being there for me (as mentioned in my first post). 

I also brought up the brief swinging that happened, to which for the 50th time said it wasn't a problem. I agree with her on this. This was something that was a ""mechanical"" approach for a solution to a problem that was very much in existent when we tried this. We (both) really have no issue to this. We know it happened, we tried it and mutually stopped and turned the page. 

I also brought up other life events that may cause resentment and really we ended up not getting anywhere else as far as the root for resentment which was discouraging. 

I then basically expressed to my wife that I will not be ok with that arrangement. I told her that I've really done everything I can and that this issue really has reached a point where it has nothing to do with me or require me to do anything that I'm currently not doing. I was very direct and saying that I will not be accepting this dynamic and that I need to be with someone who is actively involved in our marriage, works towards resolutions and is very much interested in maintaining an active intimacy and sexual relationship. I expressed how I am not going to be a ""convenience"" and that there was more to life than being roommates and coparents. I made sure she knows I love her dearly and that I do want this to work for the better. I also told her that I'm fully committed to this marriage so long as she is as well and that is she wasn't, its ok, however I will not be a part of something where these efforts are not reciprocated. I told her I have no plans of leaving, and I do not want a divorce, however, I made it clear that if this dynamic continues that divorce will be the only outcome. 

Of course tears were involved and it was a very bleak and sad ending to the session. Still nothing was said and I walked out very discouraged and very determined to start working on the 180 as soon as we left the room. It's painful and very difficult because much of the 180 requires you to be very short and cold and transactional. The saddest part is realizing, this dynamic already is very cold and transactional. 

Here is where it gets VERY interesting. I started working on implementing many of the 180 recommendations that same day. I mentioned to my wife that, ""hey, things are going to be a bit different moving forward. I'm going to honor her roommate/coparent dynamic without reproach and that it should be no mistake that I am not happy here and I am never going to be ok with it but I am done working on it if she wasn't going to work on it."" She agreed and went to bed. I started to build distance and started to basically focus on myself. Very short and transactional. She asked for help on some of her personal things to which I declined and it really shocked her. She was upset saying I was being petulant. I explained to her that, she is now fully in charge of her own life and her own issues. We didn't talk all day and we only spoke when necessary. Few days I keep this going and she's very visibly upset and stressed. I typically react to that with gestures of help or nurturing but I didn't this time. That night she was crying telling me she's stressed and she things something is wrong with me because I'm ""indifferent."" I simply listened, then I told her  that this is the dynamic she proposed and that I'm simply (much like her) taking care of myself and focusing on myself. I'm not going to lie, it has been VERY hard to be cold and distant because as I mentioned before, I love her and I wish I could hold her and love on her. However, I know this is somewhat manipulative in a way just to get her way and still keep me in the friendzone. So I've been staying the course. 

We're now going on a week of this 180 and let just say, there has been MANY changes on her side. I think she is starting to realize there is more to me than just ""friends and coparenting."" I sent her a text a few days ago essentially itemizing bills and separating the financial responsibilities 50/50 and SHE LOST HER SHIT. She basically told me it was ""out of left field"" to which I responded ""hey, friends go in 50/50 and as your friend I expect nothing less."" This was very eye opening because it gave me a glimpse of I'm really taken for granted and how her level of comfort and convenience at my expense is really overlooked. I pushed through anyways and basically told her that this is the new dynamic she asked for and that its still a ""bargain"" because she would have to be 100% if she was on her own. 

I'll wrap up with this. While the 180 has been working in many different areas, I am still very much sad about the overall situation. There have been MANY eye opening statements being said and realization that have not been pleasant to encounter. It has also sparked new energy and new efforts on her side as well. She's definitely seeking to talk to me more often and while its hard to turn down, I hope if things improve, this continues to happen. I've also noticed that she's making more time for herself aside from being a mom which is HUGE because she pretty much neglected herself for years. I'm very pleased seeing her be more herself. My hope is that as we work on ourselves, the marriage improves. There really is no telling at this point where this will go. We are very much cordial and amicable even to this day and that's a very good sign. Boundaries are set and expectations are very clear and I feel that no matter the outcome, I will be at peace with everything that has been done.  We're still going to continue the couples therapist until we either rekindle our marriage or end up in divorce. I feel like having this nonbiased third party really helps as a witness and as a guide through this. No matter what I will always love my wife, however, I will not participate in a sexless, intimacy less marriage because we both deserve better. 

Thank you all for all the kind words and recommendations and feedback. This will be my last post on  this topic and I wish you all the best. 

TL;DR: My wife friend-zoned me wants to just coparent at my expense but I started the 180 method to try and find a solution because she doesn't want to work on us which seems to be working on getting her out of her rut and helping me discover more about how she feels. Also, therapy is paramount and highly recommend to all couples. ",1715796901.0,themachucajr,relationships
UPDATE: girl (20s F) in my DND group post (20s M),"Hi everyone, so a few days ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xoy6k/this_girl_early_20sf_in_is_tearing_our_dnd_group/?sort=confidence) about this girl (Sam) in my DND group who everyone has a crush on, and how it's causing a lot of my friends to turn on me cuz they think she has a crush on me.

&#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

So I wanted to thank everyone for all the great advice I got, and it led me to take some action over the weekend. So on Sunday (yesterday), I was txting with Sam and I decided to bring up and ask her how she was feeling about our gaming group. She confessed to me that she's been feeling really stressed out lately because she feels that Jake and Dave (our DM) have really been ostracizing her, because she's been getting closer to me. She told me that Dave would send her private angry or rude messages, saying mean things about me to her behind my back. I was shocked and honestly kind of defeated to hear how these guys who I thought were my friends treated me behind my back. She said she was so cut up about this and that she didn't want to come to DND anymore because she didn't feel like it's any fun anymore, and that hurt me the most, having her lose something she loves because of some dumb guys.

&#x200B;

So, based on the advice I got here on my last post, I did two things after getting this knowledge. I called up Dave, and told him that he either needs to grow up, and treat her with the respect she deserves, or she will leave the group. He was backpedaling, but eventually came clean that he has a thing for her as well and was just jealous of the attention I was receiving from her. He said that it's not her fault and it's not my fault and it's just something he needs to work through on his own, so at least he was able to be cognizant of that. The second thing I did was talk to Sam frankly about us and our relationship. I told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she liked me as well, which she said she really did, and had for a while now (which made my heart want to explode out of my chest). I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, even with all this drama going on, and I told her that I was on her side and would support her whatever she wanted to do with our gaming group. In the end, we've decided that we are dating now and we'll both be taking a break from DND for a few sessions before we go back and tell everyone. I am just so happy to have her in my life, and if my friends can't get over the fact that we're dating, she and I will start a new DND group with people who can be adults about it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, thank you all for your help, and I'm glad I bit the bullet, I couldn't be happier right now!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I asked the girl out, she said yes we're dating now :) I called out our DM on his BS and he apologized and said he would cut it out. Looking forward to brighter DND days with my girlfriend!**

&#x200B;

**EDIT: 1.2K?? I never expected this to blow up so much! Thank you again, everyone, for your kind words, thoughts, anecdotes, and advice. I've talked to Dave again today actually and told him that Sam and I were officially together and we want to be able to come back and play all together again, but my respect for Sam's feelings overcomes my want to continue playing with them. Dave told me that he was really sorry for being such an ass before and that he is happy for Sam and I and doesn't want this to come between our friendship. I am hopeful that we can move past this! Also -- to those who suggested Sam invite a female friend to our group, she reached out to one of her best friends from high school who still lives in the area, and she is interested in joining! I think Sam will feel more comfortable, and it'll take some of the spotlight off our new relationship if we invite a new player into our group. Anyway, wanted to update and thank everyone again for all your kind comments.** ",1542640455.0,dumbthrowaway843,relationships
"My friend (24F) is encouraging me (23F) to ask out my crush (later 20's M). But they have some relationship I don't understand at all, and I'm not sure if it is a terrible idea?","First of all, I am sorry if this seems dumb.

Anyway, I started a job as a server a couple months ago. I got hired here mostly because one of my friends (Tori) was already working here and got me the hookup with the manager. 

Once I started here I met Brian. He works in the same building but in a different business (he runs the front desk of an attached hotel). I wound up crushing hard on Brian for a lot of reasons.

He is very handsome and charming, and is super nice to everyone. He is also going to college right now for a field relating to my own studies so we have a lot to talk about.

I kinda asked around trying to figure out if he was single so I could ask him out. The bartender told me he and Tori have some thing going on, which I thought was odd because she's my friend and has never mentioned him before. I asked Tori if she was seeing anyone and she told me no.

So, I figured the bartender must be wrong and thought I would ask him out. But before I got the chance there was a night after work I found Brian and Tori leaving together and behaving in a way that didn't seem very single, so I tried being a little more direct with Tori and asking her ""Hey, are you with Brian?""

She was a little coy with it and answered me something along the lines of ""It depends on the day"", which was just more confusing, but I figured I had an answer at least so I told her ""Oh, okay. I was kinda trying to feel out if he was single, no biggie.""

Surprisingly, Tori actually loved the idea of us being together, I guess. She told me he is actually a perfect guy for me and if I'm interested in asking him out I should go for it. I told her that I like, just saw them leaving work together and they seemed like they had something going on, but Tori said it was nothing like that and she wouldn't see him anymore if I was interested.

I'm incredibly confused by this whole situation. Did I accidentally break someone up? I just wanted to find out if he was available and asked a couple questions. Now Tori is all caught up in trying to set us up while I feel like I am snatching her boyfriend. 

I really like the guy and I'd love to go out with him, but I didn't mea to set all of this stuff in motion. Is it a terrible idea to ask him out now?

"Me 27F with my 27M husband of 5 years, needs tips/advice/encouragement for dealing with an uneven division of household labor","My husband is a very messy guy, he doesn't steam his own clothes or pick up his own wrappers or wet towels on the floor, fills the car with trash constantly, etc. That's part of his personality IMO- his dad is the exact same way and his mom never made him change his habits. He's ""eccentric"" if you want to give him the benefit of a doubt- he has a PhD and he's intelligent, he's book smart but lacks all the common sense. Ok, so I've established he's messy and lazy when it comes to menial household cleanliness. 


While we were first dating, I told him I wanted to have kids one day and if I had them with him I'd want to stay home with them while they are little because in our relationship I did all the household tasks and he enjoyed working super hard on his goals and work. For example, he was the messiest member of a 4 person dorm apartment so I'd go over and wash dishes and clean up the trash and bathroom in exchange for him letting me nap and study there (I lived far from campus). He thought that was cool- seemed like we would complement each other. 


We got married, we both went to grad school- he went for a PhD and I went for my Master's, then he got a job offer and I got pregnant.. we both graduated and moved back home and he started the new job. 



After baby came our car unexpectedly suffered total engine failure (I don't know what else to call it lol..) so we had to buy a new car that we pay $277 a month for now. Then I had to have my gallbladder out as well as a second surgical procedure and we reached our $5k out of pocket max. On top of that we've both had dental work since getting dental insurance and it has still cost more than $1500. So even though he has a 60k per year job and can rake in $5k teaching an online class, I am working about 30 hours a week and taking the baby to work with me. 


This is totally different than what we planned and I know it's out of necessity and I should just suck it up because TIS LIFE but this new situation is making me want to move in with my parents so bad and leave my husband behind... not because I don't love him, but because of the WORK it takes to live with him. (AKA being the only person who lifts a finger in my house and the person who takes care of baby except for once in a while he can feed or play with her) 


Each time we fight about this stuff he says he will change and start doing more stuff but he procrastinates til the last second when I have no bottles that are clean or the trash is overflowing onto the kitchen floor, etc. His standards of living are just SO different and I do not want to ever be that stupid nagging wife! He is not my child. I know it was probably a mistake to get married to someone who is so different from me but I really did think we had it all worked out, he would work hard outside of the home and I would work hard INSIDE of the home.. at least while the kids were little, and once I go back to work I'd plan on having a housekeeper and getting almost made meals and stuff.

Financial situation has changed and I want to know how to deal with either having to do everything or how can I get him to do more without being a nagging wife all the time?

I (27M) just found pics of her (27F) cheating,"I'm sorry if this sounds disjointed, I'm in a bit of a state right now.

I was using my girlfriend of 5 years' computer, and I opened an unnamed folder on her desktop. Inside I found pictures of her clearly having sex with someone I have never seen before. I can barely type right now, let alone speak. She is at work right now, she won't be home for another 6 hours. I don't know what to do, reddit. I can't think, I can barely move, I feel so... lost.

I don't know how I am going to recover from this. I can't afford to move out, but I would rather be homeless than spend one more second here.

Any advice on how to proceed or even just some kind words would be appreciated.

---   
**TL/DR: Found pictures of LTR girlfriend cheating. Please help.**

Slight update: Once I felt like I could breathe again, I looked at the EXIF data from the pictures. They're from last month, taken by her phone. 

Update 2: Thank you, everyone. I still feel like I want to throw myself in front of a bus (less so than before), but I found somewhere to stay until I get back on my feet. If anyone has any suggestions about how to stop feeling like there is a weight slowly crushing my chest, I would really appreciate it. I have some packing to do, but I will try to respond to the thread when I can.

**Update 3**: I'm not vomiting or crying anymore, so I will consider that an improvement. Now I just feel empty. Like, somewhere between my belly button and my ribs is a space that used to be occupied and now is vacant. Time heals all wounds, I suppose. 

First, thank you all for responding to this thread. You have no idea how much it means to me to know that others, even if they are halfway around the world, care about this. Your collective advice and words of encouragement have helped me immensely. 

Second, to update the situation, my things are packed and in my car. I found someone to stay with temporarily, although I'm not sure for how long. I took the things that were sentimental to me or reminded me of her, drove them out of town, and burned and smashed it all. It was cathartic. I suppose littering the outdoors with my mementos isn't very eco-friendly, but I'm hoping Mother Nature will give me a pass on this one.  

Third, as per a number of requests in the thread, I changed her desktop background to one of the pictures. Having to look at it again while I did so was even harder than packing, I think, but it is done. It was unnecessary, as I have already asked her via text to never contact me again, but it is satisfying to know that she will have to come home to that. 

To answer some of the other questions posed in the thread: 

* EXIF data from the pictures said they were taken by her phone last month.
* I have racked my brain, and surprisingly, I cannot come up with any red flags about the relationship. She is a redditor, so I am trying to avoid specifics, but they were taken while she was on an extended trip. Perhaps she thought that she could have some sort of fling with someone she met and I would be none the wiser.
* I can't explain why she left a folder containing these pictures on her laptop. It seems incredibly stupid to me, but it isn't like they were in plain sight. They were among a number of other, seemingly benign pictures.
* I do not believe she wanted me to find out; she seems very upset and has been begging me to talk with her about it.

Finally, I just want to reiterate: Thank you, Reddit. The support, the stories, and the kind words have meant more than any of you could know. ",1400681970.0,Throwaway110901,relationships
How can I (35/f) encourage my husband (35/m) to lose weight?,"We’ve been together for 10 years now. He’s always been overweight/obese throughout that time, though his weight has fluctuated. Well, he’s been overweight most of his life. 

I’m currently a little overweight and have my own goals to lose weight and get stronger. I’m doing it for me, though I admit part of it is because now that I’m not so young anymore I’m scared of problems down the line if I don’t address this now. 

He knows about this because I am an anxious person so lately I’ve been yapping a lot about this. He tells me I’m not fat, that I shouldn’t worry too much, that I’m healthy, etc. 

But I also wish he’d be on board and we could do this together. In part because even if I try to eat healthy stuff for lunch at work and whatnot, he usually buys treats or junk food for us to have at dinner or weekends. I find it hard to say no to yummy food! Also I feel bad telling him to eat it by himself.

We’ve had periods where both of us were  eating a lot of crap, enabling each other, basically. Usually when I’ve been depressed. I’m better now, but I guess he still sees me as his binging buddy.

When his son (teenager, previous relationship) is over at our place (which is often), my husband will double down on buying treats or junk food, he’ll even cook, but it’s unhealthy stuff. His son has gotten a lot into fitness lately, and he’s made great progress, so I feel we should encourage healthy eating. But we hardly eat vegetables when he’s here! (Usually it’s just me making salad and the eating the salad). Of course this hasn’t impacted his son greatly, because he has the metabolism of well, a teenager, but I don’t think we’re doing him any favors.

My husband usually goes home for lunch, because his work is close to home, but mine isn’t so I have lunch at work. I usually prepare healthy meals for myself, and leave some for him, but many times he doesn’t eat that and will buy junk food on his way home. This hurts my feelings a bit, but I haven’t told him, because I feel petty. 

Other times he has lunch with his workmates, who are also junk food addicts. They smoke, too, which my husband quit when we got together, but I suspect he occasionally smokes with them too.

In terms of physical activity, this is a struggle for both of us. I love walking, but everything else for me is so difficult and plain boring, especially working out at home. But he doesn’t like gyms. So ok, let’s try working out from home. I usually get home tired though, but I’m making the effort, because if I’m not the one actively starting the work out, he won’t join. He also does his own “routine” which is the same thing he’s been doing over and over forever, no real progression. He does walk to and from work everyday, which amounts to like 20-30 minutes daily walking.

He’s very supportive of my goals and when I bring up how “we” have to start moving more and more importantly, clean up our diet, he usually focuses on my goals of getting fitter and how I’ll definitely get there, etc.

But I think I have to be more direct with him, and this is difficult, because his weight is a really sensitive, raw spot for him. His issues stem from childhood, where his parents simultaneously didn’t encourage healthy habits and bullied him over his weight at the same time. When we’ve talked about this before, he’s ended up in tears.

I’m concerned about his health though. He has clear symptoms of insulin resistance, and I’m afraid he might even have diabetes. His family has a history of thyroid problems too. But my husband is the type that hates going to the doctor, in part because they always focus on his weight in accusatory tones, and also because of his childhood trauma he always tends to like, not take care of himself because his parents didn’t really take care of him. He’s told me (in the context of other things), that he grew up feeling he didn’t matter because he was always expected to prioritize other people first (his parents, younger siblings, even grandparents). He also had an eating disorder  which went unchecked (again, neglectful parents) during adolescence.

He has issues with his back, has sleep apnea, varicose veins, but won’t go to the doctor. He says “I know I have to lose weight, and I want to”, but he doesn’t make the effort. 

I know a big part of this is related to mental health as well, but he doesn’t want to go to therapy, he has huge issues opening up to people (even me), so…

I know a lot of this makes him sad, and I want to help him, but it’s a delicate subject. I’m afraid of making it worse. At the same time, I don’t want to feel like the mother he’s never had, if you get what I mean. This is frustrating for me, because when I’ve talked to him about this, he tells me I worry too much, but I feel it’s easy for him to say because I have no weight related issues.

I feel this is a bit unfair to me, since he doesn’t really have to worry about me having an early heart attack, while I do worry about that. Lately I’ve been thinking about how I wish we could both get to old age active and healthy, but I don’t know if we are both on the same page about that.

Finally I should add that attraction is not a problem for me. Sometimes sex is a bit uncomfortable due to his weight, but nothing else.

TLDR: my husband is obese, says he wants to lose weight, but isn’t making the effort. I want to help him but I don’t know how. He has a lot of unresolved trauma surrounding this.",1696271020.0,namelessworried,relationships
[UPDATE] Mom thinks our relationship could be better. I'm happy where it's at but don't know how to tell her.,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i76bqk/mom_thinks_our_relationship_could_be_better_im/)

TL;DR: I wrote down what I wanted to say, including boundaries. She didn't blow up, but as predicted, she didn't take responsibility either. But I've now done everything I can and can move on.

No one asked for this update, but I guess I wanted to give some of you ""told you so"" rights? I was able to use bits and pieces from almost every comment. From preparing myself for it to not go well/needing to hang up on her, to making sure I didn't fall into the trap of explaining/listing out past incidents. I basically said the following:

""I'm happy for \[list of accomplishments she's had\]. Unfortunately none of that erases 20+ years of lack of support and actions by you that clearly indicated I wasn't a priority. I'm not looking for explanations nor apologies. I've worked hard to make my peace with it, and I've worked hard to get our relationship to a point where I can maintain my mental health and have you in my life. So when you say it could be better, in my mind it's right where it needs to be. If that's to change at all, I have some boundaries that **need** to be followed: \[list of boundaries, some specific but two big ones of *Respect my boundaries* and *Respect when I say 'No'*\]. If you want us to talk more, I'm happy to pick up the phone. You have every right to ask things from me, but have to respect when the answer isn't what you want to hear.""

First question was if I thought our relationship was better before my stepdad came around - No.

Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done ""lots"" of reflection and couldn't see it ""until \[stepdad\] came into the picture"". She pushed a couple more times for examples. ""Is it because I missed some events *your dad* was at?"" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences.

Her last question was, ""Is there any way we could ever push past this all?"" I told her this is what ""past this all"" looks like. She pushed back a little bit, but when it was clear that I wasn't moving an inch, the call ended with ""Well, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.""



None of her questions or responses were any indication she was worried that I was hurt. She was trying to find justifications I might listen to, anything to poke holes. There was part of me that wondered if she always recognized how much neglect there was and just didn't want to face it, but claiming ""lots"" of reflection and not having a single incident come to mind that didn't involve blaming someone else answered that question. While she was ""calm"" while she tried to respond, her tone was very tense. Worst case here she continues to try to push boundaries and I cut off contact and it's one less stress in life, best case she respects them and it's one less stress in my life (I know this is likely a case of she'll respect them until she doesn't). The important thing for me was that I was up front with her and set clear boundaries. I've done my due diligence to telling her how our relationship could ""change"" (I used ""change"" instead of ""improve"" very intentionally with my mother). I'm relieved. Ball's in her court and I have some answers. Thanks again for the advice, sharing of your own experiences, and encouragement. It gave me the confidence and a plan for that phone call.

My(f25) sister(f31) doesn't want my bf(m26) at her wedding bc her BIL(m29) is infatuated with me and I punched her in the face. Don't know what to do now.,"I posted a few days ago about **my sister(f31) saying I(f25) cant be in her wedding if I bring my boyfriend(m26) of 5 years.** That post has since been removed, but I will quickly summarize the situation because it has escalated. My sister's fiancé's brother has made several sexual advances at me in the past and my sister has encouraged it (she tricked me into a double date). My relationship with my boyfriend is very serious and we will get married sometime in the future. The brother has always made me uncomfortable and I try to stay as far away from him as I can. My sister then decided that I was going to walk down the aisle with him, instead of with my brother(that was the original plan, theres 4 of us siblings, 2 guys, 2 girls). I told her at family dinner I didn't want to do that, some arguing was involved, she was crying, then she said I can't bring my boyfriend to the wedding and if I do I am no longer a bridesmaid.

Most of the comments said I shouldn't go to the wedding at all, but she is my sister and I don't want to miss her wedding. I went to my parent's house with my brothers and told them about everything the BIL has done that makes me super uncomfortable and how my sister is disrespecting my relationship. My dad was pretty pissed off about the date stunt that she pulled and is on my side. My mom, however, says that I need to try and resolve this with her because if I am not part of the wedding party ""people will talk"". I honestly couldn't give a shit about what extended family has to say. My mom called a family meeting and told my sister and my twin to come to the house. My dad asked her why I was no longer walking with my brother, to which she responded saying that its what her fiancé wants and she just wants to make him happy. I pressed the issue asking why is this such a big deal for me to walk with him and that he's super weird and I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to assault me. That really pissed her off. She starting crying and yelling saying a bunch of bs how this is all she's ever wanted and we're trying to ruin her special day, blah blah blah. I was tired of the arguing and just straight up said I'll go to the wedding as a guest then I'm leaving before the reception. My twin and younger brother took my side and said they don't want to be in the wedding party if i'm not. This made my sister lose her fucking mind. She was screaming now, calling me a bunch of names that I can't say on this sub; a b\*\*\*h, c\*\*\*t, w\*\*re; and also calling my boyfriend names. I decided to leave and let my parents calm her down, but before I could walk out she ran at me and yanked my hair(still screaming). She wouldn't let go, so I yanked hers too and she let go. She has extensions and apparently i fucked them up, and ripped some hair out. She tried to grab me again, so I punched her in the face. I didn't mean to hit her it was just my instant reaction to someone coming at me.

So now she has a black eye, a cut on her cheek, and missing some hair. She's absolutely livid because her bachelorette party is next week. My mom is mad at me, my dad is not. My sister is now saying that she's going to ""press charges"" against me. Can she actually do that or is she just trying to scare me? She's also pissed off because my other siblings won't be in the wedding. She told my mom if I apologize to her and agree to be in the wedding she'll let me walk with my brother. I feel like that is bs and she will still make me walk with the BIL last minute. At this point I feel like it's not worth the trouble and I just don't want to go at all. My mom and dad want me to do what she asked because they're paying for the wedding and want all their kids there. My twin and younger brother said they'll do whatever I want to do, but I don't think I should be the reason they don't go. My boyfriend feels like he started all this drama when none of it is his fault. My sister believes I ruined her wedding (she ruined it herself) and I don't know what to do. So options are go to the wedding as a guest, be in the wedding, or not go at all. My parents will be upset if I don't go, and I really don't want any more tension, but she disrespected me and my relationship. As soon as this wedding is over I am going to limit my contact with her for a while.

TLDR: My sister doesn't want my long term boyfriend at her wedding because her future BIL is infatuated with me. I told her i would not walk down the aisle with him and just be a guest. She lost her mind, became super angry, and attacked me. In response, I punched her in the face. 2 of my siblings don't want to go anymore either. Now she's saying I ruined her wedding and she'll let me walk with my brother, but I don't believe her. I don't know whether to go or not because I don't want anymore family drama. At the end of the day, she's my sister and I love her.",1681004169.0,ThrowRA-calicoastin,relationships
[UPDATE 2] I [21F] suspect that I may be my boyfriend [29M] of two years' side chick.,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lxo9t/i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend_29m_of/)

**tl;dr** Together for 2 years. Strange behavior and circumstances makes me suspicious. Found pictures on facebook of him with a girl. Can't prove whether that girl is his ""ex"" or not. Looking for advice.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rdxxz/update_i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend/)

**tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.


Again, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM. 

So, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity. 

I wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to.

On Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home. 

On Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it. 

Throughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either.

So, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again. 

I feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time. 

Thanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it. 

**tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again. 

**quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them. ",1446999600.0,throwmytroublesaway,relationships
"My husband [45M] of 10 years encourages our sons [6M, 8M(twins), 10M, 11M] to fight as a way of solving their disagreements with each other and gets upset when I [34F] try to stop them.","My husband believes that because he and his brothers were raised by their father to resolve their conflicts through fighting and everything turned out for them then it's the only way to raise boys to become ""real men."" We've had disagreements over this in the past, but as our sons get older, he has gotten worse about refusing to mediate their disputes and mostly wants them to work it out on their own. If our sons get physical with each other, most of the time he'll just watch but won't do anything. Same thing if the come to him with some sort of disagreement over a toy or sharing something. He will just tell them to resolve it on their own.

I've talked to him about how much I hate it when he does this, but he always tells me that they need to learn to resolve disputes on their own and without our help, especially our younger ones. He thinks it builds toughness in them and determination, but I think all he's teaching them to do is use violence to solve problems, and that is not what I want our sons to learn. If I'm home and around when a fight starts, I will always break it up and mediate, but my husband gives me a hard time when I do this because he says I'm babying them and that I need to let boy be boys.

I don't feel like I mother them too much. I understand that they need freedom to explore and grow, but I reject the notion that hurting their brothers is part of their development. I know it will happen at times, but I think there's a difference between accepting that brothers will fight, which I do, and standing by and letting them beat up on each other. 

I love my husband, and he is a good father in a lot of other ways, but I find his way of thinking very strange and dangerous for our sons when it comes to this. I have tried talking to him and sharing articles or books that dispute his parenting style, but nothing changes his mind. I don't know what else to do except leave him in order to protect my boys. I'm so worried that one of them is going to get seriously hurt one day while I'm not home, and I don't want to deal with that because I wouldn't do the right thing when I could. I wish there was another way to change this outside of separating, but I don't know of anything else to try except that, so any suggestions would be greatly welcomed.

My girlfriend says I'm cherry-picking her flaws. I'm thinking about breaking up. [20M][21F],"We're in an 8 month relationship. She is my first girlfriend.  
  
She has this thing where she takes hours, and I mean hours to wake up every time. So every time I wake her up, I need to come back every 20 minutes, and try to wake her up again, or otherwise she'll sleep until 3-4 PM. She's very grumpy whenever I try to wake her up and as soon as she wakes up, she's all over her phone.She has a daily screen time of 12 + hours on average.I told her both of those things bother me, and she said:""Just because you don't spend time on your phone doesn't mean I'm not allowed to"", which I totally agree with, but, like, when I leave the room to grab a drink, literally for a minute, she's already all over her phone. I just feel like it's unhealthy.And about the sleep thing, she said I don't let her rest (she sleeps for 12+ hours every day), and I stopped even bothering to wake her up.  
  
Today she refused to eat the food I made for her because it's too oily, and I understand, she's trying to keep her diet clean, and got angry and said I'm going home. (My plate was less oily than hers, but she wouldn't even eat my plate).  
  
On occasions I feel like walking on eggshells when talking with her. She can get angry out of the blue and that can last from minutes to hours, depending what the reason is. A few days ago she got mad because I didn't tell her it's raining, although I was bed-ridden and sleeping because I had a fever. She got really angry and I spent the whole evening trying to cheer her up.  
  
Sometimes, she'll just leave/ignore me when things don't go her way. Whenever I don't want to do what she wants to do (e.g walk, since I had epididymitis) she gets upset and says ""fine"" , ""I'll just walk myself"", ""You never want to do the things I want to do"", although ever since the relationship started I've been trying to please her.  
  
Recently, I feel like we've been growing apart. She's on her weight-loss journey and I'm in my first internship program and we both just focus on ourselves, seeing each other less and less.  
  
Today, after the food argument, we talked about this. I told her about the things that have been bothering me and I told her I'm not really enjoying the relationship all that much. She said, maybe you should find someone that was raised by parents like yours (my parents are very toxic and I've been verbally abused throughout my life, and I still live with them since I can't afford to live by myself) and that really hurt. She said she can't change, and that she thinks I'm looking for someone like myself, and that there are other parents like mine, that can raise the kind-of children like I am. I don't know whether that was an insult pointed towards me, or my parents, but it wasn't a nice thing to say.  
  
I'm unsure whether I'd want to be with a lazy person, and I'm unsure whether she's lazy - that's a subjective thing. But to me, spending most of your time on your phone and sleeping 12+ hours a day is laziness. She is VERY supportive of me, she encourages me and she helps out when needed. She's in general a sweet soul but I'm not sure we're meant for each other as we have different values and views. Should I try to make it work since I love her, and sincerely enjoy most of the moments we spend, or should I call it quits and just work on myself?

&#x200B;

TL;DR :   
My girlfriend always wants things to go her way, and in case they don't, she'll make sure to let me know how unpleased she is. This happens almost every time she makes a compromise. She spends most of her time on her phone, and sleeps for 12+ Hours. I Talked to her about these things but she doesn't seem to want to change. Am I overreacting?",1686836785.0,kvst4,relationships
I (19M) got black-out drunk and woke up with a friend (20F) who now thinks we're in a relationship which I don't want.,"I feel like such an idiot about this but I really need advice about what to do. I know its my own fault. TLDR version is I (19M) got very drunk with a girl in my friendship group (20F) and woke up with her with no memory of what happened but apparently we slept together and now she thinks we're in a relationship. 

I'm trying not to make this too long and hopefully it makes sense. To give you some background, I'm a uni student and I have a group of friends who I spent most of my time with. The girl I'm posting about is one of the people I'm less close with in the group if that makes sense. I've known her about 1.5 years but she's childhood friends with several of my friends so they are probably closer to her than me. She also lives with two of my closest friends. I knew she was interested in me because she has tried to make a move a few times and has asked me out in the past but I said no. I wasn't interested in her other than as a friend. I'm also avoiding getting involved with anyone due to some confusion I'm having but I haven't discussed that with anyone whatsoever so most people assume I'm just shy which is also true.   

I recently went out with some of my friends and this girl was there. Not many people stayed out and at the end it was just me and her at a bar. I don't remember how that happened but I know in the past some friends have encouraged her to make a move because they think it would be good if we got together so maybe it happened like that on purpose. I don't normally drink much and I was extremely drunk. I barely remember the part of the night when it was just me and her and I don't remember going home at all. When I woke up she was there and we were both naked. She said something about how she was happy we finally got together and at the time I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to admit I didn't remember and regreted it because that would be hurtful. I was also extremely hungover and confused. She wanted to hang out more that day but I convinced her to leave because I was so hungover. I have avoided seeing anyone since then.  

Ever since then she's been talking like we're in a relationship and I suppose in her view we are even though it's not what I want at all. This all happened around a week ago and she has been telling everyone we are together and our friends are all happy about it. I have no idea what to say which I know is weak but I don't want this relationship and I don't want to hurt her by saying it was a big mistake. I don't think there's anything I can do that won't end up with me being the bad guy and probably losing most or all of my friends. I've been trying to avoid everyone but I can't do that forever and she is pushing to spend time together which I understand since she thinks I'm her boyfriend.  

I'm probably just going to be told I need to grow a pair which is fair enough because it's true but I really need advice. I'm a socially awkward person and this is the first time I've had close friends. I don't know how to deal with this scenario. I had a dream last night that it didn't really happen and I woke up feeling so relieved then I remembered it was real and I feel so hopeless now.",1713192056.0,ThrowRA-0342,relationships
Found out husband has slept with my friend before we started dating ,"Hello. I am so heartbroken and I need different opinions on my “problem”. So I (31F) have (had) a very very good friend (34F) for 10 years. I would say best friend. I always told her everything. Every detail about my relationships and sex life. And she to me too (or I was only thinking that). My rule my whole life was to never be with my friends ex. Never. I dont like that. I dont like sharing same person with my friends (That’s only my opinion and my preferences if anyone is offended) 

So I started dating my husband (37M) and my friend was so excited. I knew they were friends before. I told her everything, every detail of our sexual life and she was so excited for me and encouraged me. 

So fast forward 5+ years my husband and I have a long rough period. And in one fight he told me my friend has gave him a blowjob. I was shocked. And I have called my friend and asked her is that the truth. She told why would he say that? And we finished conversation. 

Today he started a fight and I asked him, has he slept with her? And told me yes. A couple of times. I asked her she confirmed. She told me that was one-two months before we started dating and that she didn’t want to tell me. They had talked then and Said that they wont tell me that. she confirmed me that he wanted to tell me that at start our relationship. And that he didn’t want problems one day when we have kids. And she begged him not to tell because that would ruin our friendship.

Im so heartbroken and I dont know how to feel. She knew every detail of our sex life for past 5 Years, she knew about every fight. About everything. And she stayed quiet. So was he. Im so disappointed, shocked. Betrayed. The thought she knew how my husband privates parts are and sexual preferences makes me sick ( I am aware that he had other girlfriends and I am alright with that, but I can’t feel the other way). Goes the same way for my husband and her private parts and other. So they are the same to blame.

The only thing I told her that if she only told me they have been together I wouldnt be with him. Ever. 

The reason he told me that is because he saw text messages between us where I spoke with her because of our problems, and he lost it and was so mad at her. So i should know who I tell my marriage problems to (funny, after 5 years)

I just feel like a fool. And I dont know how to navigate with both of them. Cut out or not. My feelings are so mixed.


Tl;dr: Husband and almost best friend slept before we started dating. They agreed not to tell me. After 5+ years my husband told me that in a fight. 

Update: thank you all for your comments. I have read them all and probably will read it two more times. I have posted this to see another opinions - good or bad. And other view of that because sometimes our feelings can overcome our mindset. And I am greatful for all the comments, really.

I know sometimes I have told too much. But that was not coming in a bad way. I was to naive and I trust people too much sometimes. I understand that can hurt people. And I understand his reaction but not in this way. 

For the situation, I dont know what to do yet. I dont mind he slept with someone else before me, I have had other partners too. Simply it hurts so much because I wouldnt have guess it, never. They had a choice to tell me, they didn’t. But I guess it was from a place that is good for both of them, not me. In that time she didn’t lose a good friend and he got a wife. That is selfish from both of them because they didn’t think how would I feel knowing all that.

From this I think I cannot be a good friend with her anymore because in every situation I have supported her and gave all my best. In fact she was the first person to know I am pregnant. For my husband, he lost my trust and I dont know how work this out.

UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.,"Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

**Edit:** Formatting

**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. 

Love to you all.


**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

My BF (24M) is trying to convince me (24F) that marriage is meaningless and men who marry are stupid and insecure.,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been fighting over the same issue for months. I want to get married, and he doesn’t. It’s not like I want to get married right now, but I just want to know if marriage is in the cards for him or not. We have been dating for three years.

He hates the idea of marriage, saying things like 'it’s just a piece of paper,' 'I don’t want to involve the government,' and 'guys who want marriage are stupid and insecure, and any guy who marries is just sexually deprived.' He believes that 'any guy that will agree to marriage is either a religious fanatic or just hasn’t gotten any female attention in his entire life.'
I argue that women and men provide different things to each other. Women provide nurturing, and men provide safety. Legal safety is very important to a woman, and most women who are investing time and energy in nurturing and taking care of you would want that legal safety because, come on, we are not hominids that require physical safety at all times.

He is adamant in his views, just like I am in mine, but I’d be lying if I say this hasn’t been affecting me. I am starting to feel like maybe he is right and that I am stupid for wanting these things. Maybe any man who would want to marry me would be an imbecile just marrying me for sex and not to love me.
I have loved and dated this man when he had nothing, and when he was nothing because I saw the king in him. He is now a bit successful. He is smart and handsome, everything I could ever want in a guy—like my soulmate; I have never loved anyone like I love him.

But is there a resolution here? What if I really don’t find love again? And everyone knows arranged marriage is a gamble (though I am open to it). I don’t know what I am looking for here—maybe advice, maybe someone telling me why marriage is important, maybe encouragement that yes, I am capable of finding someone willing to marry me for me and not just for sex?
I also have never broken up before. I am confused and unsure what to do.

TLDR: My bf says men who marry are stupid and insecure and this is affecting my psyche.",1708269356.0,FamousMap5947,relationships
*UPDATE* My wife [40f] and I [40m] are having problems over one of her friends that she skis with.,"Original post:

The funny part before the rest: I had her read the original post to show how it looked to everyone. Her palms started to get so sweaty it left a stain on the laptop. She didn't have a lot to say about it except ""wow this is a lot to process.""

We set up a counseling appointment to work on things.The working solution we had was that she would tell me when they texted each other. My wife was following through with that and I thanked her every time. I also told her if she slipped up in some way to just acknowledge it, not delete messages and what not.

The counseling session was lame. The counselor seemed like he was on autopilot and just wanted to get to the Gottman books. We set up a couple of future appointments.

She had a work trip coming up. We went skiing the day before and I took her to the airport and kissed her good bye.'

I texted her from time to time and she would send pictures of the things she was seeing but seemed a little unresponsive. I figured she was just busy with everything going on. She never called me or our daughter. She would say she was taking a bath at the end of the night.

I picked her up from the airport and brought her home and she seemed distant. i had to ask for a hug. She went skiing the next day. Things felt weird and i checked the phone bill and lo and behold she called Josh for an hour one night then he called her two other nights for a couple of hours.

I checked her Facebook. The messages from her friends were talking about how he tried to kiss her at some point. But they hadn't cut him out of the group in anyway. Also one of her friends told her to delete messages and call logs before coming home as I might check them. These are all garbage people!

I put her stuff in garbage bags and told her off when she got home. I told her she was a cheater and the guy was a cheater and they deserved each other. She didn't have much to say because she couldn't even come up with a bad lie. Filled her car up and left.

I'm astounded at how morally bankrupt she is and her friends are as well. I've met these people. They know who I am and that I'm a decent guy. I just can't imagine encouraging someone to hide immoral behavior. I asked her from the start of this mess if she wanted to exit the relationship and she said she wanted to work things out. She saw how much pain it was causing me and she kept doing it. You think you know people.

I believe she was playing me and the guy off each other. Hinting to him that our relationship wasn't solid and maybe someday they could be a couple while also trying to reconcile with me. She's a narcissist and this was feeding her ego.

The short term sucks because I'm stressed and it's hurting my ability to sleep. Sorry if some of this doesn't make sense. I know I'll be better in the long run but this sucks right now. It's pretty lame that she gets to shack up with this dirtbag and I probably won't feel like dating for years.

Anyway, once a cheater always a cheater. Trust your gut. I should have told her to fuck off a long time ago. Hope I don't get destroyed in the divorce.

"[Update] Single father [38M] with my daughter [17F], discovered she has a large amount of cash and I'm suspicious.","I was signed into this account on my laptop and noticed I received PMs asking for an update to my [post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2or7bz/single_father_38m_with_daughter_17f_discovered/). So, here it is. 

I had a long talk with my daughter Sarah that night. I sat her down and described the circumstances of the discovery. I explained that I was worried because it's a large sum of money and I didn't want her savings to be stolen. 

Well, turns out the elderly neighbor, Anne, has been giving her cash for the better part of a year now. Anne wanted her to have the money to help with college expenses, and told Sarah to keep it a secret from me because I've always refused to accept money from her. Sarah also told me that part of the money was her own. She had been saving up for my birthday present and didn't want to put it in the savings account because, well, she'd have to ask me and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. 

Later in the conversation, I brought up the expensive clothing. Those were throwaways from her friend's mother. Her friend is really tall so she couldn't wear them and gave them to Sarah instead. They needed some slight alterations so she hasn't worn them yet. I apologized for snooping and explained that as a father, I was obviously concerned for her well-being. I also assured her that we are financially stable and that I've put aside enough money for her college expenses. I told her to keep an eye out for Anne, to make sure that her welfare is not affected by the money she's paying Sarah. Also, I asked her to write a thank-you card to her friend's mom and to include a present for her at Christmas this year.  

After the revelations, I wanted to reward her for her savings habit, so I offered to start a checking account for her and we looked into the options online. Turns out, the bank I use offers a junior checking which I can co-sign (overdraft fees, etc) for her. It turns into her own personal account at 18. She'll have the use of a debit card, the bank also offers an online-based financial planning guide, so she will read that before starting the account. We're going to the local branch to set that up for her this weekend.

Sarah seemed to reflect well to our talk. She took the opportunity to reveal that she has been in a relationship for a couple of months. I've actually met her girlfriend a few times before, they go to the same school and I just thought they were good friends so that was a surprise. So yes, she came out of the closet to me. 

Being a dad, I still verified the clothing story with her friend's mom. Overall, I'm happy it was just me dramatically overreacting. However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess. 

P/S: I didn't reduce her allowance but did encourage her to keep saving because it's an excellent habit. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Money from neighbor, clothes from friend's mom, so she's getting her own checking account. She also disclosed she's in a relationship. Worst of all, my tortured soul is left wondering what she's buying for my birthday.

"My (26/F) boyfriend (28/M) has become suspiciously close to a model (26/F) he photographs, and has a practically naked photo of her as the wallpaper on his phone.","Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. 

He's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. 

This is actually how we met. 

I modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. 

That was, until, Rachel came into the picture. 

I've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. 

That said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. 

The lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. 

They also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. 

I'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. 

Rachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. 

The real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. 

Rachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. 

I really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. 

He has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just ""kindred"" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. 

Am I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? 

TL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? 

**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.

**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. 

**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. 

In any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. 


**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** 
 [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)

First of all, I’d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. 

Second, I’d like to address a few things: 

1. My boyfriend — sorry, ex boyfriend — has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That’s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. 

2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I’ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that … but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they’ll find other ways to cheat.

3. I’m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just … yeah.

Okay, now for the good stuff! … or I guess, the bad stuff. 

I met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you’ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, “What’s going on between you and Rachel?” His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, “DO NOT bullshit me.” 

I tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer … ? 

Yeah, I’m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I’m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.

He could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I’d had a switchblade on me, I can’t say for certain I wouldn’t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.

Kidding. Totally kidding.  

We met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or … I don’t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!

I asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. 

The moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn’t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. 

**BARF.**

They kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. 

They had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.

And they’ve been fucking ever since. 

He mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don’t care. I’m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don’t know why or how. I didn’t ask and I don’t care to know.

Funnily enough, Ian said he doesn’t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he’s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. 

I literally said that.  

In any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. 

My friends and family, and most of Ian’s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she’s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she’s always there for me. 

For real, you guys, I’m going to miss his family. They’re good people. The best people. 

This is my first “adult” breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you’re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you’ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it’s … well, it’s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.

So, that’s the conclusion to this story. That’s what happened. 

Thank you again to everyone. 

If I have anything to add, I’ll do so below.

TL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.

**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* 

**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys.

Update: My (28F) boyfriend (32M) told me a “white lie” for almost 3 years and I’m not sure if it’s a red flag,"

Tl;dr: we broke up lol 

My previous post got more attention than expected so I figured I’d update.

Well, it’s over. As many of you suggested, I couldn’t possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically. 

I initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his “life”. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly.

For those of you who were confused about how I didn’t know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like “hey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?”. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn’t have been keen to what I was talking about anyway.

It got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I’m pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough.

I’m sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don’t even care. I’ve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I’m killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works. 

I want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you’re getting. I’m so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I’ve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I’m a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you’re not as worthless as someone made you feel. 

Thanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don’t look back.",1604431377.0,Intelligent_Ad3412,relationships
"My partner [28/M] of 7 years, deleted me [26/F] from various Instagram posts in order to continue to receive attention from someone else","

Hello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!


I have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. 


Throughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.


Things where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. 


However, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqué, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.


The next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.


At the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.


When he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. 


I asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. 


So though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. 


This has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. 


Despite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. 


Do you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!


Do you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? 


Alas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.


TL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming. He doesn't want to end things or see other people, I am a bit unsure about where to go or what to do.",1556378685.0,Feelbetterfriend,relationships
I’m [25F] tired of my boyfriend’s [30M] younger brother [19M] living with us.,"
My boyfriend and I have been together for over 1 year, living together for 10 months of the relationship. We had been friends prior for about 4-5 years with feelings for each other for years, so moving as fast as we did felt natural for us.

About 6 months ago, my boyfriend’s half brother that he has never met reached out to him on Facebook. My boyfriend and his family were aware that his bio-dad had another son but they had no idea of his identity. They started chatting off and on for about a month. I think this was exciting for my boyfriend somewhat, as he always wanted a little brother. The brother mentioned that he was about to be homeless. I’m not sure what his living situation was but I know that living with his mom was not an option.

My boyfriend asked me if I would be okay with him asking his brother if he wanted to move into our spare bedroom. His brother lived on the other side of the country (he is from Florida) so my boyfriend’s plan was to buy him a one way plane ticket to Washington. I said yes, but I didn’t really put much thought into the impact of the situation. I looked at it purely from a financial benefit. With him here, I would save money on rent and bills.

The brother decided to move in with us. My boyfriend, who is a manager at a restaurant, gave him a job that makes above minimum wage (minimum wage in Washington is already relatively high). My boyfriend decided that he would not have to pay rent for the first 3 months so he could save the majority of his paychecks on buying a decent car. These are the terms the brother agreed upon moving in.

The first few weeks were fine. My boyfriend and his brother have a lot in common, so naturally, they bonded. They both worked at the same place and worked similar shifts so they were able to carpool most of the time, occasionally asking me to drive him to and from work. Things were good.

The moment things really went downhill is when the brother quit this job after about a month and a half. From what my boyfriend explained to me, there is a lot of drama at the restaurant. To put a long story short, someone started a rumor that he sleeps with his mom. This is obviously untrue but my bf’s brother got really offended by this and quit without putting in notice or having another job lined up. Before he quit I URGED him not to, telling him my bf went out of his way to get him a job, that this reflects poorly on my bf, that he needs to be making money. Ultimately, he did not listen to me.

He didn’t work for a little over a month after this. Any money that he saved quickly got spent on fast food, take out, weed and vapes. I got irritated by this, because all he would do it play video games in his room all day, not clean up after himself, and eat our food. He showed no initiative to work again until my bf reminded him that he needed to start paying rent soon, regardless that he messed up his chance to save for a car.

He finally got another job around the beginning of last month, but could not for the life of him work a consistent week. He called out at least once a week for stupid reasons. When he did get paid, he never bought himself groceries and he would find himself broke only a few days after getting paid because he spent all his money on video games, weed & vapes. 

Then, when he has no money, at least twice a day he knocks on my bedroom door asking if he can have some of the new groceries I just bought (I swear, it’s like he waits for me to restock the fridge) asks to hit my vapes because he ran out on his, or ask for “just a small” bit of weed. I get asked the most because I work from home so I am literally always home. It drives me absolutely insane because I didn’t sign up to have someone dependent on me like this. Doesn’t he seem something wrong that he is constantly asking me for stuff but I never need to ask him for anything? Right now, he drives our cars for free, gets free weed and food & I honestly don’t think he’s trying to meet us halfway at all with the help we’ve given him to be successful. I don’t understand how he can have no shame in having to ask for stuff all the time and I don’t think his poor money management should mean he should constantly try and inconvenience me.

However, I am aware this is a behavior I encouraged by my inability to say no. I usually give him what he asks for. I’ve only recently started setting some boundaries regarding food & groceries but he still asks for food. And the weed mostly belongs to my boyfriend so he usually lets him have some unless we’re out.

My boyfriend gets irritated when I bring up my frustration about the situation. He tells me he has mental health issues and that we need to go easy on him. But me and my boyfriend both have mental health issues of our own and I don’t think either of us have the capacity to deal with this. I think his brother needs to grow up and learn how to take care of himself.

I also want to mention that my boyfriend’s brother’s room is absolutely disgusting. There is trash everywhere and I was absolutely livid to find that the new spare room mattress I had bought prior to him moving in was covered in garbage. The bed he was SLEEPING in was missing the fitted sheet and was covered in spoiled food, wrappers, and other trash. My boyfriend removed the garbage and found the whole bed covered in garbage juice. I was infuriated because I felt like his brother had absolutely no regard for something expensive that belonged to us. But again, my boyfriend justified this saying that it’s because he’s depressed.

My boyfriend and I both worked hard to get to where we are at. I don’t understand how someone can so blatantly be so lazy and non-compliant with the terms he was given to when we gave him the opportunity to move in with us. I want him to move out but honestly if he doesn’t live with us, I don’t think his life will ever get on track.

TL;DR - My boyfriend’s 19 yr old younger half brother moved in with us 6 months to get his life together but I feel like he is taking advantage of us and doesn’t take any initiative to change.",1633974597.0,angstyintp,relationships
My (m29) gf (f27) got implants and now wants more work. How do I discourage her?,"
We’ve been together for almost 2 years and she’s always been self conscious about her chest. They were small, but I thought they had a great shape and really fit her body. I discouraged her, even suggested she try therapy before getting implants. She didn’t talk to anyone other than a couple of friends and her surgeon. When it became clear she was doing it, I supported her. 

She went too big and they look and feel terrible (imo) but she absolutely loves them. To me they are so bad that I’m not as attracted to her as I was before. 

She’s so happy with the results that she’s talking about getting more work done. I’m hoping that she loses interest before she has the money to get more done. 

It’s affecting our relationship in other ways. She’s so focused on getting her implants paid off and saving for more work that we don’t do much anymore unless I offer to pay for everything. 

TLDR; my gf got implants, wants more surgery and doesn’t think she needs therapy, she only listens to family and friends that support her. 

How can I support the (wrong IMO) decision she’s already made without encouraging more work?  Do I even bother and just end it?

 I understand it’s her body and decision but supporting potentially harmful behavior isn’t being a good partner. 

Edit: she’s talking about having procedures for things she’s never expressed unhappiness with before. It was always her breasts were too small. Now she says her face is too round, her butt and hips are too small (wants a more shapely form to match her chest). That’s why I’m concerned she’s might be heading down an unhealthy path.

"My (F31) brother (M36) is ruining our parents (M,F60s) lives!","This is going to be quite the wall of text, so feel free to jump down to the tl;dr.

So in the past month my older brother's fiancee left him. This meant he lost his house because the home they lived in was in her name. He lost his vehicle because what he was driving was her old car. He also lost his job because he was so focused on his breakup that he was constantly making mistakes. He moved in with our parents who live about 5 minutes away from my husband and I.

I DO have a lot of sympathy for him. He literally has nothing, no home, no car, no job, no relationship. The problem is, this is third time this has happened to him. That's right, he has had 3 fiancees leave him now and every time he winds up losing everything. He has had two cars impounded because he gets so upset over his breakups he loses his job and can't make payments on his vehicles. My parents and I have bailed him out of these situations every time. I even paid off his back payments on his car, paid for his dog's vet bills, AND paid some of his rent before. My parents and I have literally spent thousands of dollars trying to 'help' him. Each of the past two times he winds up moving back in with my parents who are in their late 60s.

While we pay for everything for him whenever he goes through a breakup he becomes a total jerk. He spends every weekend with his friends out camping or vacationing (how he pays for it I have no idea, after the second fiancee he took a trip to Fiji with his friends but couldn't afford to pay his rent). He mostly ignores me unless he needs money, which, during this breakup I am refusing to help him out at all. The worst part is he treats my parents like garbage. If they ask him questions like, ""have you been looking for a job?"" he will yell at them. He has no problem eating the food they provide for him and living in their house rent and utility free, and driving my mom's brand new car (which she got because he totaled her last car) but makes them absolutely miserable. My mom told me he will yell at them, call her stupid, trashes their house, sleeps all day, and leaves the care of his dog up to them. Every time I see my mom lately it's obvious that she's been crying.

The most recent event took place on Sunday. In an attempt to get him out of the house for a while I offered to take him out in our boat. He seemed super excited about it and when he's excited he can actually be a lot of fun to be around. He tells me he's hanging out with friends but will be back in town Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon rolls around and he's nowhere to be seen. I get a text around 6pm that he's decided to go to a local tourist destination with all his friends, they are going to tube down a river. I'm bummed because I was honestly looking forward to it and because my brother has once again chosen his friends over his family. But it's whatever, I honestly don't rely on him for anything so it's not that big of deal. But then I find out he's driving my mom's car and she has to be in her office early Monday morning. Then the peaceful protests in our town turn into full on riots and my brother is still not home. At this point he can't get home because they've blocked off access to our town so he just stays with his friends and I wind up taking my mom to work. My Dad tries to talk to my brother on Monday about how irresponsible he was and my brother just yells at him and then locks himself in my parents basement for the rest of the day.

My parents are miserable. They want to help and have always said they will do anything for us kids, but they are just enabling my brother every time they bail him out. My Dad has major health problems that are being exacerbated by the stress my brother is causing. My mom has a history of severe depression that I see her slipping back into the longer my brother is with them. I'm really close to my parents and they are usually very fun people. The longer my brother stays with them I am seeing them become depressed, short-tempered, and miserable. I tried telling them to kick him out, one of his friends would surely take him in, but they insist that they don't want to leave him homeless. I can't convince them to kick them out but is there anything else I can say or do that might get my brother to get his head out his ass and get a job? How can I get my brother to see his behavior towards my parents is unacceptable?

It just sucks, I used to really look up to my older brother because he is outgoing and funny and the sort of person everyone just gravitates towards. Now I'm just pissed at him for how he treats my parents and simultaneously scared for his mental health because he clearly has a lot of problems.

&#x200B;

tl;dr Older brother lost his fiancee, house, car, and job. My parents took him in and he is now treating them like garbage.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Thank you for the responses. A couple of things: I am in no position to psychoanalyze my brother or parents, but I do believe that mental health is a primary reason for how any human acts the way they do and clearly my brother's mental health is not good. I am encouraging my family to see therapists, but decided I will not be paying for my brother's because there is truly no telling if he would go or be willing to change. Also, my mom works for a not-for-profit for the elderly and specializes in elderly abuse cases. She told me that she knows what he is doing is 'technically' elder abuse, but she does not want to report it or want me to report it. If things get any worse though, I will go behind her back. 

I went to my parents house last night for an unrelated reason and had a brief talk with my brother that devolved into a shouting match. I started by showing him four different jobs I found online that he could apply for, but none of them were 'good enough' for him. He was 'insulted' that I thought he would work those jobs and that's when the shouting match started. I'm an educator, I KNOW I shouldn't have let myself get into a power struggle with him, but siblings just know how to push your buttons, you know?

ANYWAY, I was able to talk to my mom one on one and she is totally unwilling to do anything about him. She will not even give him a deadline of when he has to have a job, nor will she stop lending him her car. She also reiterated how miserable she is in her own home with him around, but insists she's feels so bad for him she doesn't want to force him to do anything. 

So I told her that I am done with him, and I will not be spending any time at their house as long as they continue to let him drain them of their health, finances, and mental well-being. I told her she and Dad are welcome at my house any time, but my brother is not. I have to tell you, I have never felt like a shittier person, it's not in my nature to just give up on people.

"My [27F] Husband [28M] is addicted to porn and has 0 interest in me. I've been supportive, but reached breaking point. What next step to care for my own mental well-being?","You can probably imagine the details about porn addiction.

""The situation"" is me venting, you can skip that to get to my actual question. Thank you!

#The Situation

At first I was patient, comforted him that it’d be okay. It was good he was aware of it, don’t be so ashamed of it. I think at that point he was procrastinating with porn? I’m not sure where the line is to call it addiction… I gave tips on self-forgiveness and preventing it from getting worse. My focus was 100% on being non-judgemental and encouraging. 

I didn’t mind that he was disinterested in sex or affection. Lower libido, not related to porn, right?

It got worse. 

I started feeling really starved of affection, so I focused on that. Made a lot of advances on him all day long. Aggressive advances and just small gestures of love, like rubbing his shoulders or kissing his head. I didn’t get rejected… I didn’t even get ignored. I just didn’t get noticed. Mentioned it in couple’s counseling. It doesn’t have to be sex, but I’d like it if you reciprocate me kissing you etc. He tried. Awkwardly. The disinterest was painful to see. It was so obvious he was forcing himself.

I asked for things. Can you do this or that? Can we have shower sex? I scheduled sex together with him. Tuesday evening. Tonight. It didn’t happen. I combined the planning with seducing him - getting us out of the door for a date, dressing up in exactly what he’d like, sending naughty pictures and messages to prepare… No matter how physical the advance, like naked and rubbing oil on his genitals, it wouldn't get a rise out of him

I've bought gifts for him and left notes.

My face is not the prettiest, but goddamn I have smokin’ hot body. With the combination of lucky genes and daily hard work on myself, I'm very aware of looking awesome (at least below the chin :P ).

So I’ve tried to make my own selfies and videos - I’d spent 2-3 hours daily for a few weeks to get the best possible with self recording, so he had least could show appreciation by having me on his screen for one out of ten fap sessions or I don’t know?

I remember that I’d dress up and we’d go out and he’d be so proud. Now he’s ogling every 
woman out there.

Like if he sees a woman with long dress, he needs to fap to porn of women with long dresses. If he sees a jeans ad, he needs to go fap to butts. If there’s a blond girl around, … You get the gist.

I’ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. Not even every time… just… I want something.

I’ve encouraged more sleep and exercise, I’ve overly enthusiastically praised him for having fun with friends. He’s not depressed (yes, got checked out by a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he doesn’t want therapy anyway because he thinks everyone should fix themselves).

Eventually I outright begged him to get better (I left time between each time I asked to not overwhelm him). In person, in voice messages, in text messages. I explained how horrible I felt. 

I outright told him ""I've been feeling secondary to porn"". I'v explained exactly how I felt, how he could help by just showing some interest in me... just anything, you know?

A few days ago he said ""I still think you're attractive"" and yesterday he said ""Your selfie is nice"", but... that's all. That's all.

It’s not even about fapping, I think, he doesn’t seem horny at all if that makes sense. It’s just porn, porn, porn. He’s got things going on, a part-time job and some freelance work and he’s dropping the freelance work. He’s got plenty of friends and hobbies, so I don’t see it being a cop-out for boredom or loneliness (I think it started as procrastination and got out of hand because porn is inherently addictive?). 

I’ve begged him to find help/support. When he didn’t, I figured he didn’t know where to start, so I’ve made a document with therapy options and helplines, that he didn’t download or open. I’ve sent to porn addiction helpline to his phone so he could just tap it to call. 

#I'm giving up, what now? 

I seriously can deal with not having sex. I'm a horny woman but I'm also patient and considerate. It’s this horrible feeling of being unwanted, absolutely unwanted, by the only man I want to be desired by. Heck, even just disinterest would be easier to deal with than him actively choosing porn and pictures every single time. Everything and anything on his screen is better than me (not sure how to interpret ogling strangers?). It's crushing. I rocked this situation like a champ but the past three weeks it’s finally become too much for me. Now I feel devastated, alone, I’m crying so much.

So… I’ve tried everything. I give up. What now? I’m not ready to divorce, but I wonder if a separation would be good? Not to shake him awake, but for my sake… not being around him, not being confronted with him prioritizing porn over me or our marriage. Would that help? Because moving out would also rub it in my face how bad it has gotten. I’m also not sure what a timeline would be before divorce happens. Do I wait one year? One year till what, effort to get better or being addiction-free? 

**I want to shift my focus onto myself.** What do I do? I'm in therapy, but we're discussing work anxiety (I work from home & recently botched a big project, that's been rough on me). Note, my husband is not emotionally available to support any other aspect of my life like work, health, general concerns.

Because it's an addiction , I'm actually not mad at him. But it reached breaking point and I'm suffering. I cannot help him. How do I help myself? 

I need to stop thinking ""I can find *something* so I can help him"" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day. 

I've not been wanting to talk about it with anyone, since it's waaay too personal information about my husband, that would be a breach of trust.

I'm gonna repeat this for emphasis; I do not want to divorce yet. I will consider other drastic steps like moving out. Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. I got some donuts, lol, but that didn't make me feel better. They were yummy though!

**TL;DR** So yeah, while half of the post is about being affection-starved, my actual question is: ""What do I do for self-care, when feeling devastated that my husband isn't there for me?"". 

## Small update:

Established a two-day no contact with husband in the hopes this can recharge my batteries a little. I’m in a work crunch, so it’s not relaxing time. It should help though?

Need to hold myself accountable to moving out next month, because I’m afraid of being swayed if he shapes up temporarily to prevent me moving out. ",1528180475.0,GuerillaHug,relationships
"My (32F) Fiance (34M) walked in on my therapy session, overheard, and is perhaps upset","**\*\*EDIT: I shared an update (positive) in comments section, as 48 hours must elapse in order make a separate update post. Thank you all for the thoughtful and compassionate responses.**

Backstory: I (32F) have been with fiance (34M) for several years. I've been in therapy since 21. I am admittedly a ""work in progress"" as I always will be, though I would like to think that I try as hard as I can and have developed some strategies to utilizes when things seem to be spiraling. This has allowed me to have a stable home life, relationship turned engagement, and I've always been able to hold down a decent job.

My fiance does not have mental health issues, but often acknowledges that he wishes he was in therapy to deal with how he handles frustration and crisis situations. He has insurance, but can't seem to find the time to make an appointment for himself. He respects and is proud of me for going to therapy myself and when I become extremely anxious about situations (even about things related to our communication) he encourages me to talk about it (but not in a diminishing or gaslighting way).

Prior to COVID, I (like most others) went to see a therapist in-person. Now it happens virtually, and I actually find it more effective for some reason. When I talk about really difficult subjects I'm processing, I tend to raise my voice and cry. Fiance and I live in a small apartment and it has happened so far that he has been out of the house during my sessions, so this issue hasn't yet come up.

Today, fiance unexpectedly came home for lunch in the middle of a session. I knew that he'd come back at some point but wasn't sure exactly when. While on the phone w therapist, I was pretty viscerally upset and going off about some deeply-rooted, abuse related issues about family and ex. Fiance got home and walked towards my room to say hi and opened the door. He walked on me me speaking about something in abstract, and quickly left the room. He went into the living room and put on a podcast, maybe in an effort for me not to be worried that he was eavesdropping. So I figured he wasnt listening and continued to vent (about past resentment). Then But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was. It was a super awkward situation all around and I'm not sure how I should have handled it.

He then left the apartment and I'm not sure if I upset him. I'm also wondering if I messed up by not warning him in the morning that I would be in an appointment later. I had a million other work related things to do today on the forefront of my mind. I texted him that I'm sorry I missed him, and no response for an hour.  If I did in fact upset him, not sure how/if to apologize, so any advice would be appreciated.

tldr; fiance came home unexpectedly, most likely overheard me venting about serious issues unrelated to him, left abruptly and I'm afraid I upset him",1598467604.0,ThrowawayAnxious444,relationships
I [26F] need to break up with boyfriend [26M]. Please give encouragement and advice on how to do,"I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend of 3 1/2 months and haven’t been happy. I broke up with him a few weeks ago and got back together with him a few days after (initiated by me, stupidly). 

There have been so many issues regarding communication and clear issues with difference in values between us. He’s made so many misogynistic comments and jokes, he’s randomly cold and rude to me at times, sometimes won’t even respond to what I’m saying, and there already been issues about money (constantly borrowing from me and not fully covering dates when he invites me out—mind you, I never asked for his money when it’s my idea to go on a date or ordering food for us.) I feel unhappy and emotionally unfulfilled in this relationship. A lot of times I’m walking on eggshells because he randomly goes cold on me for no apparent reason. I’ve had several conversations about these issues, but there hasn’t been progress, and to be honest, I don’t think he sees a real issue with the stuff he has done, and supposedly, no one has ever complained about these issues except me, and that he’s never been the problem in the past relationships (clearly he lacks a lot of introspection). 

I feel horrible about breaking up with him. We were on the phone for hours last night and he’s supposed to be coming over today. But at the same time, I don’t know how I’m supposed to get over these issues (especially the derogatory comments about women). Unless he magically has a breakthrough that all the things he’s done/does are issues… I don’t see how this will work. He’s coming over tonight, and he has stuff here (including a whole table he built me) that I would need to give back to him. How should I end things? I don’t hate him, but we’re clearly incompatible. Also, I have a long workday ahead of me tomorrow, and I’m moving soon. How do I keep my sanity through this breakup because I know I’ll breakdown and I have no days off right now. 

TLDR: I need to break up with my boyfriend because of communication and compatibility issues, and he’s coming over tonight. How do I break this off with him respectfully?",1688762725.0,ImHereMe,relationships
Should I [40M] be concerned that my girlfriend [39F] of two months sees no problem hanging out with men that encourage her to cheat behind her partner's back (both me and previous partners)?,"We met on a dating app. We share so many experiences, values and opinions that we fell VERY deep, VERY fast. However, there's one area where our values don't quite line up... and it's a big one!! I should mention that one of the things we bonded over is our fear of abandonment issues (not a great start, I know!), and in our own ways, each of us have problems setting boundaries. I'd like to think we're both very recovery-minded and interested in improving ourselves, and I personally think I've made quite a bit of progress in my healing.

I'll come right out and say she's stunningly gorgeous and gets alot of attention from men, constantly! I knew from the start that I'd have to be ok with that and just trust that she'll do the right thing. That's just a foundation of a loving, trusting relationship, right? However, apparently she doesn't see a problem continuing to associate with men who proposition her after she's set up a boundary, and said she's in a committed relationship. I'm talking about the type of scenario where a guy says, completely seriously, ""Well, he doesn't have to know,"" when she tells them she's in an exclusive relationship. That's cool, she says... they can still be friends, and she'll pretend it didn't happen.

My gut reaction is that I have a problem with that. That's a dude who just trampled right over the boundary she set like she's a prize that can be won. I, personally, don't see any reason to keep a person like that in my life anymore, and it seems like it's a red flag to trust someone who would. But maybe I'm wrong? I mean, for one, she's transparent and telling me about this stuff, so that counts for something, right? I really like this woman, so help me understand where she's coming from, Reddit. Or tell me that I need to run if my gut is right on this one. Help either way would be appreciated.  


TL;DR: I don't know whether my long-standing issues or solid intuition is telling me to run far away from my girlfriend, who I recently discovers keeps (many?) men in her life that have previously encouraged her to cheat with them. What to do?",1574143739.0,throway6626,relationships
"I've [f/29] started dating someone far more attractive [m/31], help?","We've been dating for 3 weeks. Too early to know exactly where it's going, but so far he's been openly enthusiastic. I haven't felt this nervous in years! Obviously I know he's not perfect and I'm keeping an eye on that side of things too, as it's easy to get swept away.

He's very attractive, well spoken, well-read, open about his interest but not over doing it. Fantastic kisser. We're in the same industry and have similar life plans. Lots in common as far as interests. Hell, even similar ugly-duckling stories. He's been super respectful anytime I mention a boundary of sorts. I have a few as my last long-term relationship was quite abusive. Luckily my ex has been out of my life for 2 years. FWIW - I haven't mentioned my ex yet, just vague things like ""oh do you mind not surprising me from behind? I'm a bit jumpy."" This isn't my first time dating since my ex and I have plenty of  (positive!) dating experiences from before him too. I really shouldn't feel so... Almost starstruck.

**I just feel like a teenager again. Half the time I don't know what to say I'm so flustered. How do I get my nervousness under control and just enjoy the moment?** If this doesn't work out I'll be fine - I'm not so worried about my heart so much as trying to act like myself and less struck on dates!

Edit 2: I should have phrased it like I'm not used to being so attracted to someone. I'm quite confident in myself and his interest!

"My brother (M27) saved me (F20) from a life as my sisters nanny and helped me go to college, we both got disowned by family, please help me help him with his depression and isolation.","I hope this is the correct sub to post this, lmk if its not.  TA account.

Hi, I (20F) am currently in my 4th semester of college.  The fact that I am able to go to college is largely thanks to my brother Mike (27M).  This resulted in us both being estranged from family, and the reason for this post is that I need to help him with his resulting depression and isolation.

Some backstory:  We come from a patriarchal, conservative Christian background, altho we didnt really practice.  But everything was always in the “obey your parents” vibe.  My parents (both 43) are the oldest siblings in their families.   My fathers family (parents, 2 brothers, 1 sister) all live within 20 minutes of my parents home.  All aunts/uncles are married and I have 8 cousins on that side.  My mothers family is originally from here as well but has all since left the area (grandparents moved to a retirement community in AZ several years ago, uncle is career military currently stationed idk where, aunt (K) moved to AZ after graduating college for her career)  We are from a Midwest US state and are Caucasian.

This whole fiasco started when my older sister Lisa (22F) was in college back in spring of 2020.  Right before COVID shut down her college that March, she got pregnant after a party (she didnt know until after she was back home).  In fall 2020, my senior year of HS, I started my college application process while my pregnant sister lived at home.  Mike had finished school several years prior and had started his career about 90 min away from our hometown.  Lisa gave birth to twins a few days after Thanksgiving 2020.  In Jan 2021 I received my early acceptance to my dream school - nothing like Harvard but a highly rated “Public Ivy” in my state.  I had also gotten enough of a scholarship to cover the tuition (but not room/board).  Obviously I was ecstatic!  Unfortunately that was about to come crashing down.

In May 2021, my parents told me that I could not go to school and that I needed to stay home to raise my nieces while my sister went back to school since she needed to support her kids and thus needed a better education.  Much screaming ensued, with my father eventually telling me that his decision was final and that was that.  Well Mike learned what happened, called me and said “Yeah thats not happening” and we made plans.

I would like to take a moment to give a shout out to the Reddit posts back in early 2021 that discussed the steps to take and things/docs to gather in order to successfully leave home for good.  And thats what we did.  We had discussed plans a few times when he visited and took me out to lunch, and one day that July I had my essentials all packed, left a letter for our parents and after lunch we just went back to his apartment.

As you can imagine, the fallout was explosive.  Starting with angry calls and texts and lead to us both being disowned by the family for being “disloyal”.  MIke had predicted this and we were both prepared for it so it wasnt a surprise.  Anyway that August he paid my remaining school balance and dropped me off at my dorm and I have been living and studying here since then.  He has continued to pay my room/board and whatever else scholarships didnt cover ever since. I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for me.

Since then, we have had pretty much no contact with our parents, sister and all aunts/uncles and grandparents on dads side. I am still in contact with 2 cousins (F19, F17) who support me and think we made the right decision.   We do have contact with moms side, and have both flown out to AZ the last 2 holiday seasons to spend with them.  This past holiday is when Aunt K  first talked to me about her concerns for Mike that she noticed.  They are very close (she is only 3 years older than him and we all grew up together in our grandparents house) so they are like siblings and I guess she picked up on some things that were off.

The issue I need help with:   Aunt K and I have noticed him seemingly becoming more depressed and isolated and this is what I am hoping for some help in helping him.  Mike is somewhat introverted and has always had a very small social circle and a lot of his social outlet was with our extended paternal family.  There were family BBQs very often, especially during football season when it was pretty much weekly.  Throw in holidays, birthdays etc there was probably 2 big family events a month minimum.  Mike was able to attend most of those and he always tried to hang out with my dad and uncles even tho they always acted lukewarm to him.  With that now gone for the past 18 months, he hasnt really had that outlet. So please Reddit, any advice would be appreciated.  He gave me my life back and I need to find a way to do the same for him.  Thank you all.

Note:  I do plan on sharing this post with him when he visits me next weekend (my school is a 2 hr or so drive from where he lives so he meets me for lunch 2-3x per month).  I want to be able to sit down and read this through with him and talk with him about everything so thank you again.

Tl:dr:  My brother helped me escape life as a forced nanny and go to college, we both got disowned by family and he is becoming depressed, I am looking for ways to help him.

&#x200B;

ETA:  I saw a few comments below regarding our extended family so I thought I would add a couple notes:

My moms side totally supports what Mike and I have done.  We both talk to our grandparents and aunt regularly.  We have even visited them a few times in the past year in AZ.

From what I can gather on my dads side from talking with my cousins, some of the family dont think we are wrong and are just following my dads lead since he is the oldest sibling.  My uncles (dads brothers) are still very much supporting my dads point of view.

According to my aunt, my mom and sister both want to put this all behind us and move forward but my dad is being stubborn and wont let it go and they dont want to go behind his back.

The craziest thing to me is that my sister didnt even want to go back to her school!  My dad was going to force her to go back.  It boggles my mind still how they thought it would work out.

Growing up, our parents had always encouraged all 3 of us to pursue some kind of higher education after HS, either a traditional college or trade school.  So there wasnt really the gender dynamic of ""dad works, mom raises the kids"" in the extended family.  None of my aunts (or grandmothers for that matter) are traditional SAHMs.

I would also like to thank everyone who has commented so far.  I have shared this post with both my aunt K and some friends here who are aware of my situation.  Mike is still planning on coming down here on Saturday so I am hoping to update this after.",1676229330.0,Novel_Tap1132,relationships

Thank you for all the comments, my post didnt get a whole lot of traction, but I figured I'd post an update anyway.

We're broken up, I'm trying to organize a trip to see some friends next weekend. I'm not really sure what to do before then, I haven't eaten much or slept much. I've never been this alone before. I had someone to talk to for the last 7 years. Some friends reached out to me, which was nice. And I didnt cry at work. But I'm still all alone in a city that I know no-one in and this is all starting to seem like the worst case scenario for the end of a relationship. I guess I have to learn to deal with this now.

Update to previous post: I (28F) feel like I'm ready to leave my marriage to my husband (42M),"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rwcpxl/i\_28f\_feel\_like\_im\_ready\_to\_leave\_my\_marriage\_to/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rwcpxl/i_28f_feel_like_im_ready_to_leave_my_marriage_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

 Here is a little update to those of you who wanted one. First of all, I would like to say thank you for all the kind words and genuine advice, though it was all things I had heard before, it made a massive difference hearing it from strangers who don't even know me. All of that and my friends giving me some tough but much needed love, I finally got the courage to talk to my husband.  

Not long after I posted my original post my husband called me to tell me he had ended up *LOSING* the job he abandoned me for. He doesn't have a good track record with work (Just in general has been seen as ""lazy"" ect.) so this wasn't shocking but was a *COMPLETE* slap in the face. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I felt let down *again*. As soon as he lost the job, he immediately started talking about how he was going to move in with me, I became sick to my stomach because *I DID NOT* want him here. I felt and still feel like a fall-back option. I wasn't his priority in the first place but now that he is down on his luck, it's just ""easier"" for him to move here and start over with my help. I told him to not look at jobs here right away and look where he is, and he somewhat agreed.

 After about a week of us not talking he messaged me out of nowhere telling me that he had found a job in my area that ""Was a great opportunity"", he used the same wording he had used with the job he had just lost. I was talking with a friend when he sent the message, she told me point blank 'Talk to him now, or he is going to show up on your doorstep and you are going to be stuck in this situation for another few years, and you promised yourself you would talk to him this week."" She was 100% right, so I went and talked to him. 

I told him everything, how I felt, how I am feeling, how heartbroken I am, how his issues and his treatment of me have pushed me over the edge. He realized that a lot of what I said was things I had already brought up, he did own up to somethings, yet not everything. I had given him a million chances during the conversation to tell me the things I should improve on because I am well aware I am not blameless. I should have talked to him more etc. The only thing he could think of was the fact that I don't incite/participate in sex with him. I brought up my issues with sex and my insecurities, he said he understood but I don't think he understood how much it affected me (from my past trauma and other bad experiences), and how he never made me feel better. I then brought up how I hate how much porn he watches (side note: I don't hate porn, I just think excessive use can be bad), and how it gave him an unrealistic expectation of sex, he said, ""I feel like I have to watch it to get turned on to have sex with you"", that comment made my stomach drop, and my already low self-confidence deep dive even lower. Also, I knew this was a complete lie, as he NEVER initiated sex after watching porn- not once. I knew right then I was ***done***. How could I even consider repairing this when he feels like he needs to watch other people to get turned on enough to have sex with me?! Mind you, he would casually watch porn without jerking off or anything, this man always had porn open like a Spotify playlist. 

He is trying *DESPERATELY* to keep me, messaging me constantly how much he loves me, making YouTube playlists of songs, sending me flowers etc. but it's all too little, too late in my eyes. He's also downplaying the situation to his closest friends and family, just chalking it up to me being upset with him. All of this just makes me more upset, anxious, on edge, and quite frankly mad.

 I already started filling out paperwork to file for divorce when I am 100% ready and will be asking him to stop texting me as much (particularly all the lovey dovey out of character stuff) and sending me things this week.  This whole thing has been a lot, but I am grateful for everyone who took the time to send me words of encouragement. I have realized, and am continuing to realize, my self-worth and I know I am worth so much more than a man who never tried in our whole 8 years of a relationship up until now. There's more I could get into, but I think I'll leave it here. Thank you all again for all your kind words and advice. Feel free to comment on the original post if you’d like to say anything, or would like to give words of wisdom or advice.

TL:DR: I finally talked to my husband about everything and will be leaving him soon. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post!",1643859908.0,wheresthecoffeebro,relationships
[Update] A colleague (30ish M) that I (28F) dislike keeps trying to force an uncomfortable conversation with me. How do I navigate this?,"[link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7wewwb/a_colleague_30ish_m_that_i_28f_dislike_keeps/)

I wanted to post a quick update because a lot of people here seemed  as annoyed with this caveman as I am. 

I got a ton of great advice (thank-you!), and I started practicing what I would say to his face the next time I ran into him. I also considered alerting the management at the club he chased me out of, but I didn’t have to do that. Apparently he brought it to the club himself and tried to rat me out for my “rudeness,” but it totally backfired. 

One of the managers approached me a few days ago and said “Justin” told her about what happened. My stomach sank at first because I thought she was going to encourage me to talk to him, but she said just the opposite. Without even hearing my side she told him that I don’t have to talk to him if I don’t want to. She also said she won’t be booking us on the same shows anymore, and that the staff knows not to allow him into the building on nights I’m performing. She said she wants me to feel safe at the club, and she’s got my back. What a win for sisterhood!

After that, he tried reaching out to my SO who also shut him down and told him to leave us alone. I don’t know if he’s let it go at this point, but I’ve been making notes about everything like some people wisely suggested, and I’m feeling validated and supported.

My [45F] sister’s [41F] boyfriend [40sM] has encouraged her to make herself unhealthy for his sexual pleasure. I am worried about her but she thinks I am overreacting.,"In the past year, my sister has gained a lot of weight. It's enough to be concerning under any circumstances but especially since our family has a history of problems with heart disease and diabetes. It was also concerning because she seemed to gain it so quickly, so I thought it might even be tied to a medical issue. 

She never mentioned any problems or brought it up, so I debated for a while whether or not I should say something or mind my own business. It is easy for me to sometimes forget that she is an adult who can solve her own problems because in many ways I still see myself as the older sister who needs to take care of and look out for her, but ultimately I decided not to say anything until a few weeks ago. I felt like I needed to say something for the sake of her health and well being since it was becoming clear that the weight gained hadn’t stopped and that she was continuing to get bigger. Separately, I have also been concerned about how any health problems she might have could impact my niece [12F] and nephew [14M].

I tried to be as polite and sensitive as possible and focus solely on my concerns for her health rather than on her change in physical appearance. Initially she downplayed it and tried to act like it was only a few pounds. I kept asking questions trying to understand if this was due to a change in lifestyle or if this could be a medical issue, and she at first told me that nothing much had changed about her diet or level of physical activity. I thought that in that case it could be something serious, so I started pushing her to see a doctor to find out what was wrong. That was when she admitted that her weight gain hasn’t been an accident. It was encouraged by her boyfriend who she said has a thing for women who are larger. 

She said that not long after they began dating last year he told her about his preference and said he thought she would look sexy at a heavier weight and filled out some. At first she was hesitant, but he persisted and eventually she agreed. It started as 10-15 pound test gain to see how she felt, but after she gained the weight, he asked her to gain another 10-15 pounds and she did. This led to him asking her to gain an even larger amount. 

When I asked her why she agreed to go along with this, she told me that initially she did it because it made her boyfriend happy and very “appreciative” and also because she liked him and figured that at 40 and with two kids her dating pool was much smaller and getting smaller each year. She also admitted that she didn’t mind so much because she figured that with her approaching middle age she would have gained weight anyway. 

However, over time she said that she gradually got adjusted to the lifestyle shift and started to like not having to watch what she ate or feel obligated to go to the gym or make herself miserable trying to stay skinny. She also said that the weight gain had made her feel more feminine and sexy due to her boyfriends reaction and some of the changes to her body. 

I tried to point out that beyond this being unhealthy physically it was deeply concerning that her boyfriend had pressured and possibly manipulated her into making such significant changes to satisfy his personal preferences, even at the expense of her health, but this upset her. She thinks that he encouraged her to gain weight because he saw how miserable she was trying to stay in shape and knew she would be much happier letting go, not because he is manipulative.  

She hasn’t really acknowledged anything I’ve said since she told me all of this and seems set on continuing to gain weight until her doctor “forces” her to stop despite having already gained 60 pounds in the last year for her boyfriend, and I don’t know what to do. She is an adult, but I don’t know if I can stand by and watch her do this to herself. I don’t want her to die or develop heart disease or diabetes like our dad and other family members did, but I think she likely will if she continues to gain weight. I also think about the impact that this will have on my niece and nephew. What if she does die? I can’t imagine how that will affect them. And even if she doesn’t die, what if she ends up like our father and severely limited by her health for the rest of her life? It was awful and heartbreaking to watch him suffer for years. I don’t want to have to do the same with her. I want her to be healthy and able to enjoy her life. I also think she doesn’t realize that even if she changes her mind and wants to lose weight it won’t be as easy as she thinks. I know how hard it is to lose a few pounds as you get older personally, so I can’t imagine how hard it would be to lose 60 pounds or more.  

I am stunned and saddened that she doesn’t seem to care about how any of this affects herself or her family.  I don’t know how to get through to her. I feel very powerless, but I feel like I absolutely need to try and do something even though I believe it will create tension in our relationship. I just don't know what that would be. But then again maybe I am wrong. I know she is an adult, and I do wonder sometimes if I need to instead learn to accept that ultimately I cannot change her mind. 

Torn over which way to go. Hoping someone can help me decide.

"(UPDATE) My [26M] gf [23F] instantly gave away an expensive and thoughtful gift I got her, I'm pissed and don't know how to address it","OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38dbzb/my_26m_gf_23f_instantly_gave_away_an_expensive/ 

Hello /r/relationships once again, 

I did not expect my post to get this much attention, to be honest, I got completely overwhelmed with the outpouring of support I have received and would like to warmly thank all those who commented and sent PMs. This is a throwaway, so it was difficult to keep juggling between this account and my main one. 

____________

Here is the update: 

Before I submitted this, I already knew I had to talk to Kara about all of this. Most of you encouraged me and gave me pointers as to how to proceed. However, I really did not want to see her/talk to her. Instead of giving her the silent treatment, I was a bit cold and stiff. I was extremely nervous because I did not want to bring it up and blow up in anger or turn it into a fight. Kara started noticing something was seriously up, and she started pressing it. I told her I'd take her for a drive to talk it all out. 

I took her for a drive that evening. She was starting to act a little cool herself and as soon as I started talking (before getting to the gift issue), she cut me off and told me I'd been giving her hell through out the past week. She started telling me she did not like ""detached"" me. I told her to wait and please let me continue and hear me to the end. 

So I talked. I told her everything calmly, rationally, and nearing the end, I broke down and got very angry/emotional. She kept completely shut, and held my hand, patted my back,... She then told she preferred not to answer, because any answer she'd give me ""would never be good enough"". I told her I saw no logic in giving away instantly such a thought-out meaningful gift. She thought I was mad because of the money, and the argument derivated on that for a while. 

I kept telling her that her unwillingness to say anything beyond a bland ""I'm sorry"" over and over was frustrating me. She finally caved in and told me she had felt ""pressured"" by the prom-organization committee because she hadn't contributed enough this year to this organization. Between work, us, her social life, her hobbies and other charitable organizations, she found herself contributing less (understandable). She wanted to make a significant donation to appease the prom-organization committee who were already running into other troubles. She said one of her friends kept talking about how wonderful that gift was. I felt betrayed. I told her I felt unappreciated, and low on her priority list. 

She hasn't stopped apologizing. She thought I'd be happy that a gift I gave her would make such a significant donation. When I asked her about why she felt the need to give away the significant pieces (custom necklace and box), she said she'd forgot and was too embarrassed to ask back for them. I told her about the selfie text and how she responded to me by lying, and she said she meant that I'd get to see an unfortunate girl wear it and be happy, not her.

I told her I needed to think this through, because I felt my feelings and thoughtfulness did not seem to be sufficiently appreciated. Kara is a forgetful person, and I have to remind her of many things, which I just took as a character trait I'd accept. But I never thought she was careless and/or oblivious. 

I talked to this about many of my friends (not common friends, but my friends who have met her before), and they seem dumbfounded by her behavior and attitude. We're currently on a break, but she keeps calling and texting and I'm doing my best not to answer. I just don't know what to say and am simmering in my hurt. I might be able to pick myself up and move on from this incident and get back to our relationship normally, but I'm too hurt and raw right now. 

I don't have any particular questions, but if anyone has any advice I would gladly take it.

UPDATE: I left and you can do it too!!,"UPDATE: I left and I just wanted to shout it from the Mountaintops!

My first and only Reddit post  is here [I need to leave my husband](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d1licq/i_know_i_need_to_leave_my_husband_but_im_feeling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

And I am just so thankful for the insights I gained there. There was some blunt reality but it felt loving and it’s a big part of what made me realize I was fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habits and behaviors wouldn’t negatively effect our kids.

I was encouraged to start seeing a therapist which I did. The first one I tried ended up being a beautiful fit which I regard as nothing less than a miracle. She was blunt and insightful and gave me the courage I needed to face my guilts and fears and put my kids first. 

He’s an addict. That is a lifelong battle. And because of everything else he has put me through and let me do alone, I just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever. 

It took me just under 3 months from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubts, making a plan, and getting the hell out. Making that plan was seriously my biggest obstacle. And I let it be, I think I used it as a crutch. Finally, I sat there for 2 hours and went through every possibility till it just clicked and I went “duh! That can totally work!” 5 days later I took all my stuff and the kids while he was at work. 

Here is what I want to share with those who face similar situations: my therapist let me know as kindly as she could that although I did a great job of protecting my kids, there was no way I could guarantee 100% that they would always be safe there. And if they ever got into any of those drugs or were harmed because of them, my kids would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where I knew those dangers were present, for subjecting them to it. 

That shattered my perception of control real fast. Because its true. We cannot watch every movement every minute. 

I just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 years of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness, equality, and a partnership, I was finally able to leave the man I have been in love with for 16 years. I truly believed with every fiber of my soul he was my one true love. 

And I almost didn’t make it through the first week away...it was much more difficult than I expected having grown to hate him so much...it still hurt...but I did make it through and already I am so much happier, so much freer, my kids are more loved (he is finally giving them attention), and I can see hope for us all. 

I made excuses for his behavior because I felt I could see the nuance of it all...But what others helped me realize is that some behavior needs no nuance to it. Some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it.

So I just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation, you might need to start talking more about your problems so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is. Then put yourself first, don’t let them manipulate you back in, and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should.

TL;DR my husband is a lazy, selfish drug addict who I could just never quite convince myself to leave. But I finally shared my struggles with others who helped me see the real problems and accept the solution: taking the kids and GTFO. Already we are so much better off ☺️",1575949691.0,mrsgulch,relationships
Update: Has anyone excommunicated a parent? I (25F) am about to telm the man who raised me (47M) to never contact me again. I could really use encouragement and advice.,"K so I'm on my phone and apologize if this is a huge mess. I'll post the orignal post below but I'm not sure I can get it to link on the app.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42gvai/has_anyone_here_excommunicated_a_parent_im_25f/?sort=confidence

So, I had planned a letter I was going to deliver while he wasn't home but he ended up not leaving that day so, not wanting to wait another day, I sent an email. The email was worded in a way which summarized events as well as explained how he had made me feel but not how I felt about him as, in my eyes, that wouldn't be productive. Many people told me it was well written. I also informed him he would be blocked on all forms of communication and that any attempts to come over would be met with a call to the police. Finally, I told him he didn't get to be a grandfather to my son any longer.

His reaction was one of two I was expecting, but not the one I wanted. I wanted anger. I wanted him to throw a fit and curse my name! But, he's been holding back tears for days (I can only recall 2 times in his life he has ever cried. It's not a norm for him at all). My brother said he is a wreck and hardly speaks. There was apparently a rather bad incident where he almost broke in saying he'd never see his daughter or grandson again. This was all very hard to hear. He was a wonderful father, truly, until he fucked up that day. It's been hard for me to see his positive attributes after all he's done, but they are there. The problem is he was raised in a time where men were taught to not express their feelings if they are ""effeminate"" ones so all he does express is anger or joy. There's not a whole lot of middle ground. This, often, paints him as an ass and makes connection difficult. But, despite all my issues with him, I knew there was empathy in there, it just took a lot to get it out.

No one has ever done this before. Many complain of his lack of proper communication and his lack of abilities to express himself without pretty much being an ass, but no one has done what I did. No one laid out, maturely and calmly, every hurtful thing he did and told him to back off. It has hit him hard.

My brother (the one I was raised with, I have a few siblings) isn't talking to me. He's calling me unreasonable and saying I never even gave this man a chance. Please remember, I have already talked to this man prior about how wrong what he did was and how he hurt me, so yes he did get one. I'm also being told that it needed discussed because he didn't know I felt that way. News flash: this is a problem that a reasonable adult knows about and would know that saying such things are selfish, damaging, and not easily dropped. 

My brother brought me to tears. He painted my father as the victim despite my 6 years of hell after all that man said to me. I did receive some comforting advice from my aunt though and she helped me to put on my big girl boots and stand my ground. No one else's opinion matters, no one went through what I did and can't judge, and don't let them see you cry or they will try to weasel back in. 

I did get some confirmation from my mother that he has chosen to seek counseling. This is HUGE! He has always opposed counseling and considered it bupkis, so not even having to debate it and saying ""Holy shit I need help!"" on his own is very big! 

I have thought about a lot and there are a few major points:

- Reacting in dispair instead of anger and hate showed that he cared and felt bad. He didn't blame me at all as he realized he fucked up and hurt me. He has only blamed himself.

- I stated that a normal person doesn't need to be told how damaging this can be, but that doesn't mean there aren't ignorant people out there. To him, he apologized so it was forgotten. He didn't consider that just because HE dropped it didn't mean I might not have and could have been still hurting. It's looking like he really didn't know it could effect me like this.

- This makes sense. See, my aunt (Mom's sister) married his cousin (yeeeeeeaaaaaah.....I know) and she said that it runs in the family. Her husband often thinks that because he was capable of dropping something or because he moved on that there's no way she could still be upset. Apparently, it's normal for that family to not consider that another's feelings could work differently than their own. There is an abscence of knowledge that two people don't work the same...just because you can doesn't mean I can too...

So, I have a question here. I find the ignorance of not knowing how damaging these actions were to be a legit reason as to why he went about his way and didn't think I could be hurting. To me, that's an ""Okay, well that answers a few questions."" moment. He actually didn't know that asking to see the girl you raised as your daughter naked could seriously fuck her up. In his mind, it wasn't a big deal. Now, while I do see this as reasoning it's way fucked up! Like ""Okay, well now I know why but this is not okay and simply talking things over won't fix this!"" so I 100% think he needs therapy. I have been handed several resources and start my own in a few weeks so I also think he needs to let me have my space and get through my own, but am I crazy for thinking that, if he gets the therapy he needs and learns about boundaries, why they are there, and why this was so damaging that I'd be willing to have a discussion with him? 

Like I've said, before this he wasn't a bad dad! I have always bragged about my awesome childhood and we never had any prior issues. Sure, he tends to judge before speaking of pride...but those types of issues could have been discussed in my eyes! If you remove the disturbing conversation and keep the minimal affections, diverted attention, and irrational judgements those are things I would have insisted needed a serious conversation and I would have expressed myself. But, after making me feel like less of a child of his and leaving me so scarred I was too hurt...I couldn't understand how he could have been so selfish. I thought it was all just him not caring that he hurt me when the reality is he didn't know! He thought after his apology that I couldn't hurt anymore. Is it unreasonable to be understanding of this and willing to try again after space and therapy?

 I never WANTED to do this but I didn't want to stay in my position either. After all he caused I found it the best option and I still do. But, if one says ""Holy shit I didn't know she couldn't let it go and I didn't know that this was such a horrible thing to do and could cause damage like what she described! What's wrong with me?! I need help!"" is it unreasonable to want to talk after time and space (and therapy)? 

As said in my last post, he has issues. He's makes many racist and sexist comments, he's a huge perv, and he'll yell before he talks while also being overly judgemental of small things, but these traits never affected his caring nature. Sure, I am the polar opposite of his political and moral compass, but that's not uncommon in families. I was okay just avoiding all that before. As long as we don't have to talk about those things then I'm good! But he has always opened his house to those in need and has, many times, been there for others when he could. He's not uncaring, I think he's just emotionally ignorant, if that makes any sense. 

I find myself flipping between ""he's a horrible person"" and ""you just need to ignore his ramblings"" often. I feel like if he was that horrid that he would have told me to fuck off and thought himself in the right. But this opened his eyes and he's wanting to truly change and get help. He's at least intelligent and respectful enough to know that forcing yourself on someone is wrong so he never touched me, for which I am grateful but no, it doesn't lesson my pain.

If your shitty parent(s) said ""I didn't even know I hurt you so bad and I should have. I need help and I'm going to get it because I love you"" would you be willing to talk after a decent time out? 

TL:DR: Dad broke and decided he needed therapy with no instruction from anyone else despite being against it all of his life. Am grateful and thinking this is something that could lead to forgiveness if executed properly. Am I crazy for that?",1454279043.0,NicoleMitchell,relationships
My fiancé is hiding my medication from me,"I could use some help navigating this situation, please.

My (26f) fiancé (33m), together a total of over 4 years, are getting married this August. We have a 2.5 year old son as well.

I am diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress disorder, and obesity.

My fiancé is diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. 

My family has extensive history of mental health disorders and my childhood was traumatic. 

I've always had issues, but they got worse after having my baby and I was finally receiving extra care through a postpartum program so I received medications for the first time. An antipsychotic and an antidepressant. I took those for about a year and a half, and they helped me a lot. Things weren't perfect, but I was much more level headed and capable of facing life's challenges.

Well, around last fall my fiancé decided he can't stand me on medication. He never loved the idea, but he really started to hate it then. I gained 30lb from the antipsychotic and that was certainly part of his concern. Now I'm 40lb heavier than when we got together.

Over the course of many months, he would guilt me every day about being ""drugged"" and ""dependant"" and encourage me to come off of my medication. He believes that I'm being manipulated by ""big pharma"" and prescribed something that I don't really need. 

I consulted a psychiatrist and they didn't support me coming off of my meds but helped me do it anyway.

I've been off of all of my meds for a month and a half and GUYS it is not. going. well.

My mood swings are incredible, I'm agressive and mean, violent, having insane manic episodes, spent literally all of my money (financially dependant on him now... I'm a full time student who doesn't work), and also miserable depressive episodes. I also had a 4.19 GPA in school, but this semester I am failing. 


My fiancé believes that if I: Have proper sleep, eat half my maintenance calories, and exercise, among other healthy habits, then my mental health issues would be resolved. Believe me when I tell you that he puts IMMENSE guilt and pressure on me every day to push these things on me. 

My mom, his mom, my siblings, my friends, my therapists (I have 2), my family doctor, and myself all believe that I need to be medicated.

He says he refuses to marry someone who is ""on drugs"" and has given me that ultimatum. 
I had a very scary manic episode last week and I reached for my antipsychotic, and he wrestled it from my hands, spilling it all over the floor. He picked them up and hid the bottle from me, and refuses to tell me where it is. 

Yes, I know these are red flags, but please remember that he has Asperger's syndrome, and that I am putting him through hell too. He cries every day from the stress of dealing with my mood swings. But he believes it will get better without medication. I don't. 

My question is, how can I navigate this situation? How can I convince him that this medication is not a ""drug"", it's literal medicine to ease the symptoms of my very real conditions? How can I convince him that these intense symptoms are not only withdrawal? And how can I convince him that all those cruxes of health that are ever so important to him that I achieve cannot be accomplished or even worked on while I am struggling just to stay sane?

Thank you.

Tl;Dr: My fiancé is preventing me from taking medication that I believe I need. I don't know how to convince him to let me make my own choice and respect that decision.",1718330929.0,somethin-cool,relationships

I'm on my phone but I wanted to give an update because people like them.
First off, thank you for all the replies. Emotional manipulation is hard especially in a relationship. For me, I like to see the goodness in people and I trust people, which are great qualities, it can also set me up as a target. Thank you for confirming what I was seeing and feeling, it's difficult to see these abuse tactics from inside, so much so that you start to actually think what this person is speaking truth because why would they tell you differently. I mean why would your partner be intentionally hurtful?

On to the update

I didn't want to ghost him because I think that's mean so I sent him a short text that said ""I don't feel that we should see each other anymore. I wish you the best of luck.""

He sent me a couple of wtf texts, with the last one saying ""you didn't honor your promise to me. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings but you don't keep promises."" Followed up with ""I'm a really awesome person, you'll come to your senses and figure it out. Let me know when you are brave enough to be an adult relationship."" Ending with that ""I don't deserve to be treated this way and I will not tolerate it but you're amazing and I love you. Please don't contact me again"" 

There was more, it was pretty lengthy but that's the core of the message.

I read it and said oh okay, don't worry to myself and blocked him.

So not a big drama, it's just over and I'm done. I'm going to take some time to myself and do some home projects that I've been meaning to work on and enjoy the holidays with my friends and family.

"Me [28F] with my BF[30 M/F] duration 1.5 years, My BFF (28F) came out as Lesbian and my BF is furious with me.","I'm gonna keep this short. I have been best friends with Nina for 12 years now. We became especially close about 10 years ago when she confided in me that she was Gay and depressed. She comes from a conservative christian family. She was dealing with a lot of personality conflict and was suicidal even for a while. I became her support and cheer leader and encouraged her to get therapy. I wnet with her to LGBT support groups and while her mental health improved, she decided to ""stay in the closet"". She dated a few girls through the years disguised as ""close friends"" and ""room mates"" I was the only one who knew about her relationships. 

Now, like many female BFFs we spend ALOT of time together and know an unhealthy amount of info about each other private and personal life. She has also supported me through my difficult times and is truly my sister in spirit. 

I have been dating my BF for a bit over a year now and things are getting serious we are at point of discussing future plans like moving in together and time line for marriage etc. We have a good relation ship over all. 

Now, 2 weeks ago, on her Bday. Nina finally came out. First to her family and then on FB to everyone. A lot of her family has abandoned her over it. so I invited her to spend thanks giving with us (I'm Canadian). We had our own small dinner with just some close friends on Saturday. At dinner Nina gave an emotional speech and thanked us for loving her as she is and then thanked me especially for saving her life (her words) and supporting her all these years.

well, after everyone left i could say my BF looked irate. I asked him what was wrong and he suddenly kinda exploded like YOU KNEW ALL SHE WAS  GAY? i was like yeah...and i thought he was upset i never shared it with him and started explaining that it was not my secret to share. 

He goes on to explain he feels betrayed that I had a close friend who would be sexualiy interested in me! He went on about all the times I spent the night at her house even sleeping in same bed with her and concluded that I have basically been cheating on him this whole time. 

I was baffled and mad and answered probably louder than I should have that he was insane and she is my best friend and basically my sister and what he was accusing me of was sick and he needs to either apologize or GTFO of my apartment. 

Well, he did. and later texted me to un-invite me to his family's dinner which was on monday. He said if he was this close to a girl I'd be mad too. I think his comparison is insane. anyways its been almost a week and neither of us thinks we should apologize. What do you think? what would you do? I'm tired of living like this even a break up would be less frustrating at this point. He claims I disrespected our relationship and i think he is way out of line. who is wrong here?

Friend [F27] encouraging me [M27] to stay single while she dates?,"So I have a friend I've become pretty close with and we discuss a lot of personal things with each other, one thing being relationships (or my lack thereof).

However, there is one thing that slightly bothers me whenever we talk about it: she seems to discourage me from finding people to date whenever I mention it for more than a few messages or days. She has called me desperate, told me maybe I don't need to date, questioned why I wanted to date and has made a few other dissuasive comments whenever I talked to her about things related to getting dates (I'm not even getting matches on online dating though, and I suppose height, looks, a bad profile could be to blame). I guess I feel like it's a bit unfair because she's always talking about her guy problems and it also makes me feel undesirable.

What's most confusing to me is that she has told me a number of times that she values and trusts my judgement, but at the same time it seems as if she thinks she knows me more than myself when she makes these comments.

My question is why is she behaving this way? Or could it be that I'm talking about dating girls too often (a couple of times every 2-3 months) / in a desperate way and that annoys her?

FYI, I've been told I was cute by girls a number of years ago when I dated and before I became busy with my career. Friends also often tell me I'm a nice person, they tell me I have a sense of humor and I'm respectful, so I don't think I'm some sort of jerk.

We live together, split rent, and have a great time together. We have been looking around to buy a permanent home and I can really say I love this girl and want to marry her.

I wanted to help her with that. For our one year anniversary, I took her to Europe. We visited Paris, Belgium, Berlin, and Austria. We had a BLAST and have at least three albums packed with pictures. For our second anniversary, she surprised me with a trip to Australia to go scuba diving in the reefs for a few days. It was amazing. For our third anniversary, (now agreeing to taking turns to pay) I got us a two week trip to Japan since she had always loved Japan and wanted to go. And this past October, we took a European cruise together. We always have so much fun together, but since we have returned from the cruise on October 16th, things have been sort of weird...

Ivy has progressively gotten sadder it seems. I've asked her what was wrong before and she has always kind of sighed and told me she didn't know, but that she felt something was off. I would tell her any changes I saw in her and she'd either pinpoint it as ""just feeling blue"" or ""I'm pretty worn down"" or ""Something just feels missing."" She used to do photography all the time, but her camera has been collecting dust. I've tried busting it out to her, since photography has always made her smile, but she told me she ""wasn't feeling it"" multiple times, so I gave up trying to put the camera back in her hands.

She is now obsessively writing all the time. She works on her laptop for work sometimes in an extra office room we have. When I've walked by and peeked in to check on her, she's been scribbling furiously in this journal. When I've walked in, she's closed it and asked if I needed something. I've asked what she was writing about and she's told me it was a thought journal to help even her brain out. Fair enough, I thought, everyone needs an outlet. Anything to get my old Ivy back.

Her work performance has gone down, too. She works the bare minimum amount of hours, as before she tried to work some overtime for a thicker paycheck. She has just been coming home earlier and earlier, getting into her pajamas by 3pm, and refusing to want to go out or do anything together like stream a movie, make dinner together, or have sex, things we used to do and enjoy together all the time.

She mostly dodges questions, like:

Me: Hey, how are you feeling?

Her: Fine. 

Me: Want to watch a movie?

Her: No, I'd rather go to sleep.

Me: It's only 7pm, babe...

Her: Yeah, I know, works got me frazzled. I'll watch a movie with you tomorrow.

And yet, that movie date never comes and she seems to be an old recording every time I ask her to do something with me. I bring her food to her in her room and she eats while laying in bed, watching Ellen or Oprah. I've noticed them to be more of the ""female empowerment"" shows, she's been watching. (Not to be sexist!)

Finally, two weeks ago, she cracked to me. I was sitting at the kitchen table eating and surfing the web. It was like eight in the evening so Ivy had already gone onto bed, but suddenly she appeared in her robe in the kitchen and began making herself coffee. I asked her if she was having trouble sleeping and she told me with tears in her eyes that she needed to seriously talk to me. I sat there and watched as she cried silently and poured herself some coffee and finally seated herself next to me at the table.

She told me straight up that we were getting old. I agreed and laughed about it, saying we were growing old together. She didn't laugh though. She went on to say that as a woman, she could only have babies for so long and after long thinking for the past three months, she realized that was what was missing. Marriage, a baby, a home that we had yet to settle deciding on. (Mostly because she had no energy to go look with me and I didn't want to go without her.) She began crying telling me she wanted to have my children before it was too late and began apologizing profusely for her behavior and talking about how stupid she was.

I stopped her and told her it was normal to want children at this age and that I had thought about it, too. We both have steady income, can afford another person in the house, and can afford to spoil it rotten. I told her we may have to wait for awhile on a baby, though, until we got a new house and got settled and began making regular payments on the house, and then put everything in a row and evaluate if we wanted to have a baby. I also informed her I was very interested in marrying her.

She continued saying how she wanted a baby *now* and that it would cure her depression she had been feeling, but I told her that was not it and that she needed to start getting active with life again and start living how she was only months ago on the European cruise. Of course, she got angry and claimed I didn't love her and she's still been depressed. Sleeping nearly 14 hours a day, working from home for only two or three hours, getting short paychecks, and writing obsessively. She has not revisited the baby, house, or marriage talk. I've urged her to go look at houses with me, but she says she ""isn't interested in devoting her time to things that aren't promised"" even though I want to buy a house with her. She thinks that since I don't want a baby for another year or two, I'll never want to marry her, buy a house, or ever have children, which I'll try to explain isn't the case, but she's still a little too wrapped up in the baby fever she's got.

What the hell do I do?

"My [20F] friend [19M] of 3 years has a lot of ""strong"" opinions but he's an awesome guy. Do I address my concern with his beliefs?","Sup reddit, I've been friends with this dude Frank for 3 years now and he is an awesome guy. Really funny, incredibly smart and witty, just a cool guy to hang out with. However in the last few months I've learned through our conversations that Frank has a lot of ""strong"" opinions that most people wouldn't be comfortable with. Here are some of them.


- He will hit a woman with no hesitation if she tries to strike him first. He says it's massively fucked up how unfair divorce courts are, that a woman can cheat and still get the house, kids, half the money, etc. He says feminism is ruining the society and taking accountability away from women. He says a woman who makes a false rape allegation deserves a life sentence. He says it's stupid that a woman can have consensual sex with a guy then claim rape and everyone is on her side.


- He doesn't hate gay people but he despises flamboyance. He thinks the nudity and behavior at gay pride parades is revolting. He is against gay marriage and gays adopting children. He frequently uses the word ""faggot"" but more often as a commonplace insult than a homophobic one.


- He thinks trans people are disgusting, that they're mentally sick, an abomination. He still calls Caitlyn Jenner ""Bruce"". He says gender reassignment surgery is twisted. He doesn't consider trans men to be men and trans women to be women.


- He thinks promiscuity, casual sex, hookup culture is gross. He is a strict believer in early and committed monogamy. He thinks open relationships are pitiful, he actively slutshames, and says a woman fucking 50 dudes isn't ""empowerment"". To be fair, he says a man who fucks 50 girls is also a piece of shit.


- He isn't racist but thinks its fair to acknowledge prejudices and says that stereotypes are based in truth. By this he means he doesn't hate black people but would much rather walk at night in a white neighborhood than a black neighborhood.


- He doesn't drink. He hates alcohol. He thinks people who drink themselves silly are pathetic lowlifes. He says if he did drink, it would only be one glass of wine over a fancy dinner or a glass of champagne at some special occasion. He says drinking at parties and bars is for boring people who have no way to entertain themselves other than making fools of themselves.


- He says all gang members, thieves, and violent criminals like rapists and murderers should be killed without trial. He thinks adultery should be punishable by prison time or even death.


- He thinks porn stars and prostitutes lack any self respect and thinks they're subhuman. He is disgusted that some people actually marry active/former pornstars or prostitutes. He doesn't think that porn or prostitution is just another job, he says its for people who have no self worth.


- He thinks lowly of obese people and calls them lazy pieces of shit. He thinks its stupid that an obese woman can consider herself as beautiful as a fit model. He used to frequent fatpeoplehate. He thinks HAES and being body positive is idiotic.


- He doesn't like that society puts too much pressure on people to be ""accepting"" and ""open-minded"". He says that's just an excuse to tolerate sick and weird bullshit. He is proud to be called ""judgmental"", ""intolerant"", and ""closed-minded"" by the people he offends.


I know what he sounds like. He sounds like a sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, bigoted prick. Believe me, I even think that of him sometimes. But despite this he is a great guy. He doesn't try to shove his beliefs down everyone's throat but will abide by them if the topic comes up. He isn't a fedora wearing neckbeard loser or anything, he's actually pretty charming, in shape, and a few of my friends even asked me to set them up for a date. He always turns them down though since they're into hooking up and he's not. Frank likes to hang out with me since I'm funny and intelligent. He respects that I don't drink a lot, I don't hook up, and I'm not mega liberal. Of course I disagree with most of his beliefs. I am accepting and tolerant of gay people, trans people, I'm not racist or sexist at all, I don't slut shame, etc. I do agree that women are unfairly favored in divorce courts but that's the only thing I agree with him on. 


He keeps most of his beliefs to himself and only discusses them when it is pertinent to the discussion. But still it sort of makes me uncomfortable that I'm close friends with someone who has these opinions. Should I tell him I'm concerned that he has these fucked up hateful beliefs or just ignore it and keep being friends? Should I even end the friendship? I'm worried that being friends with him might lead others to think I share these beliefs when clearly I don't and never will.
   

tl;dr: Friend has a lot of fucked up opinions. Ignore it or address it? End the friendship or not?",1439997607.0,factoidaltoid,relationships
I ended my LDR after F28 told me (M27) she met an old friend,"Hey all. I’ve recently been going through one of the worst times in my life and I found this sub reddit and I’ve finally decided maybe it’s time I ask for advice from the community.

So....I’m a M27 who met a F28 around 3 years ago now. She’s from Brazil, I’m from England, both living in our respected countries. 

For the 3 years, it has been amazing. We mutually agreed that we are soulmates and fell in love with one another after a year into the LDR. She is absolutely gorgeous, smart, kind, etc, she’s basically an absolute angel. For me, she is the girl of my dreams that I never knew I wanted before. I cannot begin to explain how perfect we are for one another.

Now it’s important to note that she suffers from chronic depression and anxiety. Every so often she would go quite due to the lack of life she would feel within herself, which is understandable with depression, and would sometimes take a few days off replying. 

I learned to accept this, and I had no problem as it was genuine, and it wasn’t due to any problems with what we had together. For this reason, of course I would endlessly support her in which she very much appreciated. I knew she loved me very, very dearly.

Fast forward to a few days ago, she hadn’t replied for about a month prior. The last I responded was 2 weeks into that month. And hadn’t replied since as it was clear she needed space. Again, which I was okay with, because of what I previously said. 

Now, up to this point a few days ago, I woke up to her unfollowing me on Instagram. Of course, I freaked out and that was the confirmation that something was up. I approached her with what was happening, questioning as to why she unfollowed and hadn’t spoken to me in a month, asking her what was really going on. 

Long story short, she told me she had met someone else at this point. She said they are a friend and they have just started talking at the start of the month that she was ignoring me. I was distraught, clearly beginning to freak out, questioning her again as to why she would disregard me so much when she knows I’ve always supported her depression and problems she faces to the very end. I stated that she knows I support her and my patience and unconditional love throughout her quietest and roughest times.

She told me that she doesn’t think I want to be there, she said I never talk about coming to Brazil. She also apologised while crying her absolute eyes out to me, which suggested to me that it is in no way as cynical as my emotions felt it was in terms of her not caring at all. That confirmed that I knew every emotion for me was genuine. She told me she didn’t tell me because she knew how I’d react (obviously).

It’s important to keep in mind that we were planning for me to come and visit her in a few months time which we couldn’t wait for. It’s also important to keep in mind that she suffers from insecurities about her life because of her growing into her very late 20’s, it’s something she freaks out about due to anxiety and her ‘getting on’.

It ended with me basically saying goodbye to come to a decision by her actions, implemented immediately. She said goodbye and told me how sorry she was and that she shouldn’t have done what she did and that she knows she’s a bad person for it. She stated she knows she probably doesn’t deserve to be happy for her life and probably never will be. She said that it is the first time she has ever hurt anyone like this, or even close.

Also, she was in a LDR with a guy from the US for a few years before we met each other, which ended very very badly for her due to the actions of the guy vanishing and saying about other women and basically being completely careless before leaving. 

What do I do? I have never felt this type of break up feeling before, and that’s probably because I’m entirely in love with this woman. I know break ups make everyone feel the same distress, but this is different to anything I’ve ever experienced. 

I’m so confused, I feel like this has happened due to her own insecurities playing apart in this, as mentioned above regarding her age and position in life, as well as her overthinking she’ll never be with me or that I didn’t really want to visit.

Last bit, her and this guy never had sex, or kissed, or anything, just talking to the point where she ignored me and realised her mistake. She also never technically broke it off with me, she never said it was over, I’m the one who freaked out and said goodbye and blocked her (haven’t spoke since) as I thought it may have been obvious.

Please help me, I’m feeling completely foreign to myself. 

Do I just leave it at the telling off I gave her and blocking and move on? Or do I give it a few more days before going back to her and trying to discuss this situation more clearly.

I am head over heels for this girl. 3 amazing years with such a perfect person and happiness with one another, and due to the circumstances seems like a bit of a waste to leave it as is. I feel like this isn’t the end. 

After all, I may have always supported her through texts, but perhaps I pushed her away by not calling and videoing her everyday, and that perhaps may be the overall reason, as well as her insecurities. 

Thanks all, hope it made sense. Please be gentle, I’m an innocent soul.

*UPDATE* - it’s been almost a week now since I confronted her after unfollowing me and received the honest news which lead to me going. I haven’t messaged her yet as I previously replied on some posts. 

Assuming you read all replies I posted to comments, you’ll know I was thinking of going back to speak with her about it more positively and leaving on a better note, however the more I come to accept the situation into normality, the more it angers me with what she did. Moreover, it makes me want to remain no contact completely. I feel a sense of empowerment by reacting as any human would as the victim of emotional cheating and taking off. It feels like it’s the one thing, yet most powerful way to go by for my own self respect.

How can I (20F) educate my sister (13F) about sex?,"As a kid and a teen, I never received any kind of sex education from school or my family.  Everything I ""knew"" about sex as a pre-teen, I learned from my peers at school, the internet and porn. Needless to say, that placed me in all sorts of embarrassing, unnecessary and stupid situations.

As young as 11 years old, I learned sex is essentially when a woman spreads her legs and lets a man in to give him pleasure; that a woman's value is in how cool, chill and hot she is; and started seeking for male validation, displaying inappropriate sexual behaviour for my age and throwing my female classmates under the bus if that would get me male attention.

It didn't help that my family is conservative, my dad has sexist ideas and I was raised a Christian (in the traditional, restrictive sense). My parents, at home, would reward me with attention when I would laugh at sexist jokes, much like my classmates at school. I learned being ""chill"" would make me seem fun and earn me friends. So I had a lot of wrong ideas about sex, sexuality and what it means to be a woman

At home, I was a polite, sweet little girl my family was proud of. At school, I would make dirty jokes. I would cuss. I would draw explicit stuff. I would talk about my body to boys. I would make sexist jokes to get on the boys' good side. I thought I was ""one of the guys"". Except the guys were mean to me and didn't treat me like a friend. They knew what I felt and were taking advantage of it. They blackmailed me once using a personal secret I'd told them and it was distressing. Yet I continued seeking for their attention. I was just too young and uneducated to see what was going on. Thankfully I never did anything physical with them, or else I would've regretted it immensely. I changed schools later, and being in a new environment with different people kept me at bay.

A few years later, when I was around 14, I found feminism through social media and started reading about it. I learned what healthy sex and positive sexuality look like. I learned I don't need male attention to feel like a lovable person. I learned my body is wonderful the way it is. I learned sex is not something a woman gives to a man, but rather something two people, regardless of gender, can share equally. I learned about my menstrual cycle and how my body works in ways nobody had ever told me before.

I had to tear down all my warped ideas about sex, being a woman and sexuality. My body image changed. I was going down a dangerous road as a pre-teen, but feminism turned my life around and helped me grow into a healthy, empowered adult. Still, I get deeply ashamed when I remember what I was like and the things I would do for male attention when I was younger.

My sister is 13 years old and, as her big sister, I want to make sure she doesn't have to go through what I went through. She's really similar to what I was like at her age. Shy, sweet, smart, nerdy, a little insecure, feels like she doesn't fit in. I know at her age she has likely heard and seen a lot of things she might not understand. Maybe her classmates talk about it like mines used to back then.

Either way, I don't want her to be in the dark and do and say things she doesn't even understand because she feels pressured, like I used to. Don't get me wrong, I know she will make her own experiments with sexuality just like I did, but I want her to be informed so those can be healthy and positive experiences. Education is the key to empowerment and protection, and I want to empower and protect her as much as I can.

She's the person I love the most in the world. We have a great relationship and can talk openly about all sorts of things. She started menstruating this year and I've already explained all about her cycle, why it exists and the different menstrual hygiene products including the cup, period panties etc. their pros and cons, and helped her pick one that better suited her. It was really nice to be able to do something for her nobody had done for me.

At school she learned about the biology of conception, reproductive system and genitals. But, like me, she has received no sex education at home or at school. So I feel the need to step up and do it. My parents aren't going to and I know they won't mind if I do. The other day I showed her both an external and an internal condom and asked if she knew what they are, she said no and genuinely seemed not to know. It seems there's a lot she doesn't know. Even less than I did at her age.

I'd been waiting for her to come up to me and ask, but I realised when I was her age I'd never ask my parents, and now I believe I should take the first step. She has been expressing frustration at not being able to watch certain types of content with me and being excluded from conversations I have with my mom, and I think it's time to let her learn.

So Reddit, considering my history, my relationship with my sister and her age, how can I educate her about sex without making her uncomfortable?

TL;DR: How can I, a woman who went through a lot of trouble and embarrassment as a kid for lack of sex education, educate my sister to protect her from sexism and insecurity?",1601489139.0,holdnarrytight,relationships
Did this guy in my class like me or was it all an inside joke and he had ulterior motives?,"Sorryy it’s really long (tl;dr at the end)

Okay so this happened during my first two years of highschool (I’ll be starting college in a few months). Ik this is old but it’s something that’s been bothering me cause I could never figure out what his intensions were. We’ll call this guy N and his bestfriend A. Here goes the story: 

It all started when we were working on the first group project for the year (presentation on women empowerment). N and I were in the same group (assigned by teacher) and we did a lot of group projects together during those two years of hs. Since our group was all girls and he was the only guy in it, one of my friends suggested we should do a short skit before the presentation where N would pretend to push one girl and say something like “I’m the guy, I’ll talk during the presentation cause guys can do it better than girls”. Out of literally no where, N looks at me and goes “I won’t hit her cause she’s really cute”. I didn’t realize what he had said but everyone was looking at me and he was smirking so I thought he probably made fun of me or something so I rolled my eyes at him. It wasn’t until my bestf (who was also in this group) brought it up again that I realized what had happened. I didn’t really think much of it tho cause he was the class clown and flirted with girls all the time (he was tall and good looking but not my type, he would flirt with teachers too and all the girls wanted his attention smh). 

Anyways I thought it was a one time thing and that was the end of it but boy was I so wrong. He kept saying all these things like “you’re so cute” “you’re so sweet” “look at her she’s so cute” blah blah everytime we would work together in the group. 

Towards the end of 9th grade, we had this one science project and I was the team captain so I had to choose my own team. Coincidentally, my team was all girls again and two of my teammates forced me to choose him (ik I shouldn’t have done that but I gave in and picked him). Now this was in front of the whole class so obviously this invited a lot of rumors but since he was popular and I was not, everyone forgot about it soon. Also during this science project, he tried to take things further. He sat on a chair next to me and kept trying to talk and said things like “it was really nice sitting with you today” “I really enjoyed this period cause I was sitting w you” but he didn’t mean it cause he was the class clown. 

When our group went outside the class to practice for the speech (related to that science project), he didn’t let me talk cause every time I would try to speak (I’m super nervous cause stage fright so I was already hesitant to speak) he would say things like “damn look at her guys she looks so cute” whatever tho after trying twice I gave up. There was a little staircase next to where we were practicing and he was sitting on the railing and all the girls were in a different corner. I stood next to him cause I wanted to lean against the railing and there wasn’t any free space anywhere else and I honestly didn’t even think much about it but he started trying to get me to sit next to him on the railing but there wasn’t enough space for the both of us to sit there so I kept denying (don’t worry he wasn’t forceful, it was actually pretty cute and I think one girl even went “aww”). 

Then on the last day of 10th grade, I was talking with some girls from my class and N came over to us, looked me in the eyes and said “I’ll miss you” and that was the last thing he did before leaving the class (our school was only till grade 10 so we had to go to different schools after that). Ik a lot of girls were jealous of me for having his attention which is why I thought maybeeee he might have had a little something for me but then again, I mentioned how I think this was just an inside joke right? Here’s why I think that:

In the beginning of 9th grade, everyone was silently judging each other, which is totally cool. N’s friend A is a bully. He doesn’t really bully anyone like that but ik for a fact he’s the one who talks shit about others to make his friends laugh. So I think A made all this up, he told N to flirt with me (since we were together in groups and I was probably the easiest target in the group) to see my reaction so that they could all laugh at me. Or they thought I had a crush on N so he would flirt with me on purpose and they could all laugh about it. Honestly, N did make me blush so they did get what they wanted. 

The weirdest thing about it tho is that whenever I was sitting alone, A would always stare at me, and the way he would stare was so so creepy, he wouldn’t even try to hide the fact that he’s staring at me. Even after I’ve caught him staring, he would still not look away and if I ever ask him something like what are you doing, he’d stare for a second or two more and then go “nothing I was looking at *something behind me*”. A gave me super creepy vibes and I really do think all this had something to do with him. I’ve thought about it a lot but haven’t been able to come to a conclusion and so I wanted an outside perspective on it so Reddit, what do you guys have to say about all this? 

Tl;dr: guy in freshman and sophomore year of hs flirted w me but he flirted w other girls too, gave me a little more attention than them but I think it was cause his best friend planned all this as a joke to make fun of me for thinking he likes me or worse, they thought I had a crush on him so all that was to tease me and make fun of me but I’m not sure so I’m asking Reddit",1624284488.0,Homoneanderthal_,relationships
I (18M) feel conflicted with my gf(18f) and my girl friends(18f)posting nudity on instagram. Am I out of place?,"I'd like to state that I support woman equality in every way I knowingly can. I understand and agree that women have been suppressed for centuries.

Please don't hate me for being open. If you disagree with me, please convince me othewise, I only want the best for everyone.

I believe that men are seen through the same societal lense when it comes to nudity. Sure, women still wear bikinis to beaches because nipples are still oversexualized by most males, however, muscular male chest muscles are oversexualized by some females too. It isn't seen as wrong to do either in societies eyes, as far as I've experienced. But, I do think when you have attractive features to show of, no matter your gender, you end up making an unspoken statement to those around you, I would guess.

Onto my intended question:

Is it wrongful of me - as a feminsit - to be against my friends and girlfriend crave to show more skin on instagram as a way of self empowerment? (naked bodies, bumms and boobs showing. Bottom genitals and nipples sometimes covered with a sticker or emoji)

I 100% believe it's their choice and have every right to do so, but do I have the right to feel uncomfortable with my girlfriend doing it?

NOTE WE ARE ALL BETWEEN 18-22

I see males do it too on insta sometimes, and I honestly have the same opinion as I do to girls doing it; I see it as seeking acceptance externally from others. The only acceptance anyone should seek is from themselves from within themselves...It is not healthy to seek public acceptance for who you are. Males are often bigs, and sexualize most naked photos of woman on insta and facebook, mostly.

Seeing male genitals, unless it's mine, grosses me out, while female genitalia more than generally turns me on. That being said, I just don't want to frequently see naked humans. Maybe because I don't want to send random women sexual energy, neither of us deserve that. I don't want to send gross energy to males either. Nor do I want to be over sexualized, nor my girlfriend or friends.

Thoughts? Am I wrong? I don't want my gf doing it.

TL:DR: I am fully supportive of women empowerment as a male feminist.I believe male and female nudity are both sexualized by society:Women's breasts and male muscular chest.My friends and girlfriend (all under 22, youngest 18) frequently post nipple pictures on insta. 100% their choice to do what they please. I see it the same way I do with men posting muscle pictures, for self empowerment. When it comes to my girlfriend, and friends, I feel as though they should seek self acceptance and empowerment from the only true source, within. I don't think nudity on social media is the way to bring equality. They are frequently posting more and more body parts. Nipples with markings, bare nippes, and bum. This to me, a male, who finds these body features attractive, can't see the difference between this and seeking acceptance externally. I don't agree with it",1538087113.0,MrSheeeepy,relationships
Always the bridesmaid but never the bride,"How to feel about this? I've (33F)  attended countless weddings and on several occassions I've been a bride's maid. I've never given much of a thought before and in fact I enjoyed attending weddings because of the gowns, parties and whatnot. 

However, I've started envying girls who've tied the knot. I had a long-time boyfriend pretty much early in life (14 years old). We broke up. Now my current boyfriend and I are going strong for 4 years already. A lot of my friends thought that I'll be the first one in the group to get married but it turns out that's not the case.

I find it difficult because when you reach this age, everyone else seems to be getting engaged and married and doing adulting stuff. One of my friends gave an unsolicited advice and jokingly told me that I'm an expired goods of I don't marry and have kids soon. I felt insulted. That friend got married just last week.

"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend[23 F] of three years, looked at another woman and hurt her how to stop","We've been together for a little over three years and started out on somewhat rocky terms. To make a long story short, I didn't trust her whereas she trusted me completely and I kept talking to other women while with her. This led to me hurting her feelings/self-esteem repeatedly as it made her feel ugly and unwanted and unable to compete with the others that I was talking to. I even kept pictures of my ex, despite her telling me to get rid of them, and when she found out that I didn't that further destroyed her trust for me. I stayed faithful in that I got my shit together, got rid of the pictures, stopped talking to the other women, learned to trust that she wasn't going to just treat me as a fling, and tried to put my full effort into treating her well as my significant other. We moved in together generally we were happy together.

Nevertheless I still would look at other women from time to time, no flirting or anything like that, but I would still look. That hurt her more than I realized at the time, and I agreed that I would stop looking. The not looking at other women eventually became part of my daily routine, I would spend time on my phone or looking up at advertisements or off in the distance or at my feet so that I wouldn't have the problem. But from time to time, I would notice a girl's thighs in a short skirt, or someone's chest in a low cut top, and as hard as I tried and as guilty and sick as I felt everytime that happened, I couldn't completely stop. The worst thing is that it would happen occasionally when she was around, and I would say that it didn't happen even though we both knew it did, but I wanted so badly to just deny that it was happening because I didn't want to keep hurting her. I wanted to believe that I had the willpower to just cut it out completely at my own will.

Eventually it worked and for a long time I was able to not look at other women completely and we were happy as we had ever been together, it was wonderful. The trust was being rebuilt and she was more forthright with her love and affection, and things could not be better between us. And then one day, while on the bus to go downtown, I looked at a girl on the bus younger than the both of us who was wearing a lot of facial makeup. I didn't find her pretty or attractive or anything of that nature, but I looked right in front of my girlfriend and that ruined all we had built up again. The insecurity was back, as were accusations of me looking at other women, and slowly we built the trust again, slowly we worked things out and things were good. And then today while getting to a restaurant, the server bent down to get us menus and I found myself looking down her top. I was embarrassed myself and I looked over to my gf, who saw what I had done and was embarrassed, and I looked back over to the server and she was embarrassed as well and I had made a total mess of the whole situation. This could very well be the last straw in a relationship where she is the love of my life, truly my other half in that I find myself deeply entranced with everything that makes her who she is, physically and mentally. I've put her through so much crap with this looking at other women and the general rockiness of the beginning of the relationship, and I feel horrible for everything I've done to her. I told her that I do love her, that I don't value these other women that I look at, that she means everything to me and is the center of my world. Maybe she'll stay and believe me, maybe she won't and I'll lose her for good this time, but I need to change this about myself because I personally don't think it's fair to her at all. I used to be tortured whenever I saw her making eyes at other men, or checking them out, and I hate that I make her feel the same or worse. I want to stop, please r/relationships, can you help me out here?


EDIT: Think I should've added that she is an attractive woman and regularly gets hit on and looked at by other men, and in her previous relationships and interactions with men she was always treated as the center of attention. I don't consider myself to be on the same level as her, and I do not think that I give her this same sense of empowerment because of my actions in the beginning of the relationship, so for her I think it stings that much more when I look at other women.

**tl;dr**: My gf is hurt by me looking at other women, I have made it part of my routine to not look at women, or avoid looking below their eyes, but I can't get it completely to stop and today with her I looked at a server's chest as she bent over.

"How do I respond to ""You're lame, stupid slut,"" when it's the ONLY kind of response I get from women my age?","22F, moved to US four years ago (but I was raised in an American overseas community, so it's otherwise unnoticeable). I apologize if this sounds pretentious, or like a problem that's easily solved, but I really was not socialized around people who think it's okay to talk like this and it just.. pushes me over the line and I end up burning most bridges. The girls I'm talking about are all 21F or 22F.

Honest question, is this a California thing?
I've tried to do the textbook assertive response before, and I've explained to friends nearly verbatim, ""Look, I don't think it's okay when you call me those names. It's fine if other girls are okay with that, but it degrading to me and I don't want to hear it again."" The response to that is usually something snarky, like, ""Oh, someone's on their period."" 

It doesn't matter if I continue in my adult-voice, I get blown off 100% of the time. I've only lived here for four years, but this has happened CONSISTENTLY with every friendship I've had-- unless I keep it an arm's length relationship. I feel like I have to push women away and maintain some distance if I want to be respected as a human being. 

I also have a big issue with these particular women making a joke out of college & the 'real' world. It's fine if you want to goof off on your own, but when I want to hole up and study for a weekend (just a weekend!) I get berated with these kinds of comments. I know I can come off as pretentious REALLY EASILY, especially when I'm making these sorts of judgments and comparisons in my head and it can come off on my tone of voice, but I think I'm doing a pretty good job so far given our differences. Most of these girls have no f*cking desire to be in college or to work for living, and are also ridiculously critical of me when I'm jobhunting or pulling an all-nighter. One time they had friends over the night before I was taking a GRE test (it was a practice one, but it was offered through Kaplan so I couldn't really.. reschedule), and they wanted me to smoke with them. I explained I couldn't, took a shot (they insisted), then went upstairs to my bedroom. They then got their friends (most of whom I've never met) to chant ""NERD, NERD, NERD, NERD"" over and over again throughout the night. I'm neither the life of the party nor particularly popular, so I don't understand why they'd go to such great lengths to embarrass me unless it was a particular attitude about people who reject their lifestyle.

Last night, I got a ridiculous facebook message (I know, I know, facebook drama) from one of these girls that reads:

""Hey slutbag were going barhopping sunday night, no excuses, better see your whoreface out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Seriously? I understand it's facebook and it's my job to censor whatever I don't want posted there, but even if it was a private message, it's still crossing that boundary of being ridiculously degrading. 

Just reflecting on my own, I think it's a weird twisted culture of women that think this is some version of ""empowerment."" I know that these women are *trying* to be endearing; I understand that, so I don't think it's some sort of hostility. I just think the blatant dismissal of my feelings is really a bad sign that I somehow missed the socialization boat and there's no way to swim back on it unless I agree to be part of this weird culture.

..Thoughts?

"This morning my [26F] girlfriend jealousy-raged me [27F] and is upset I didn't properly reassure her, now expects an apology?","I'm queer and in my first relationship with a woman. Me and Jane have been together for 9 months. She has been cheated on multiple times in her past, and has serious jealousy issues as a consequence. Our relationship has been fraught with a lot of challenges in communication, but we are both focused on growth and have made a lot of progress… but I'm baffled by an exchange from this morning and need outside perspective.

I met Jane in Nebraska. We were serendipitously both looking to move to the Bay Area, and started dating. She got a job offer and moved several months before I did, so we did long distance while I waited for my opportunity to move. In that time, I ended up developing a mentor/big sister type of friendship with two ""baby queers"", Victoria & Hanna, these 20 year old girls that I had met with Jane at a queer empowerment group in Nebraska before she moved. 

After Jane moved, I went on a group camping trip with Victoria & Hanna and occasionally hung out with them and provided advice. Victoria & Hanna actually had a budding romance between each other that I was super supportive of. However, despite it all, Jane started to become jealous of Hanna, believing she had a crush on me. At one point, I mentioned Hanna’s name and Jane completely lost her shit - that’s when I realized how serious Jane’s problem was. But, since I was moving anyway and didn’t feel like putting energy into forging new friendships, I let Hanna drift away rather than try to tackle the issue with Jane. When I was leaving Nebraska, Jane helps me move and had suggested I invite Hanna to my going away party, since it would help her “get over it” to see us together, but at that point I felt awkward about it all and Hanna really wasn’t important enough for me to go out of my way to do that. 

That was all 6 months ago. I haven’t kept in touch with Hanna consistently since I moved and actually deleted her number from my phone for a bit… but she is really good at keeping in touch, occasionally sending me kind texts, so I ended up putting her number back in my phone. Every time she texts me I feel anxious and consider deleting it because I’m scared of how Jane would react if she saw. Well, last night Hanna texted me “Hope you are well!”, and apparently Jane saw when she was plugging my phone in for me before bed.

This morning Jane said “I’m feeling really sad about something and I know it’s stupid and I’m embarrassed, but I don’t want to talk about it now, we should talk tonight.” I said, “Did I do something to upset you?” To which she responded “No, it’s me. I just have to trust you.” and I replied “Well, that’s pretty cryptic, I’m going to have a hard time concentrating at work today knowing you’re upset, but alright.” She then asked me for a ride to the train, so we got in the car, and halfway to the train station Jane suddenly turned off the radio and said “I’m just going to say it. I saw Hanna texted you last night and you told me you had deleted her number and I’m still upset that you didn’t invite her to your going away party so that I could get over my jealousy about her.”

Note, historically, Jane has a tendency to immediately take a VERY combative tone, it’s almost.. venomous. When we get into any sort of a tense conversation, her attitude and temper flare right away, while I remain calm up until a point. Once my patience runs out, I blow up. Essentially, she has a habit of verbally “pushing me” until I meet my threshold, and then I snap and push back HARD, and she feels like a victim. I am working on controlling my response, but I have also told her “When you choose to take that attitude, you are choosing to take a path where it is very difficult for EITHER of us to be successful.”

Back to this morning. Jane told me she was upset in the car. I felt my defenses go up, since I had done nothing wrong, but took a deep breath and started to calmly respond. Jane then cut off my sentence, and immediately erupted into her venomous tone. I did my best to keep breathing, and also asked her to calm down, but she wouldn’t stop. I tried to help ease her concerns by explaining why I hadn’t invited Hanna to my going away party, and Jane just kept growing more upset, interrupting me and totally disregarding what I was trying to say, blaming her jealousy on the fact that I hadn’t given her the chance to tackle it by inviting Hanna to my party, and accusing me of lying about deleting her number from my phone.

This was all overwhelming, and I did my best to stay calm. I know that there were several points where I had to stop and breathe, so I know I wasn’t perfect. But, since dropping her off, we’ve been texting. I told her that her reactions this morning twere not okay. She apologized for her attitude, however, she expects ME to apologize also. She is saying that by trying to explain why I hadn’t invited Hanna to my going away party, I was trivializing her feelings and defending myself. That since she had started the morning by saying ""I'm embarrassed and it's stupid"" that my only concern should have been to reassure her. That I should have realized when her responses were worsening by trying to explain things, and should have just stopped talking and reassured her by saying “You have nothing to worry about, Jane”. 

I'm feeling very uneasy about the whole interaction. I shouldn't have to be scared that my girlfriend is going to blow up because a friend texts me something kind. I'm feeling hurt that I have to reassure my girlfriend that she can trust me when I have done NOTHING wrong, and her jealousy is unfounded. 

Do I owe Jane an apology? What should I do?

   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend jealousy raged me and expects me to apologize for not giving her proper reassurance that she has nothing to worry about.

Edit: The reason I have stayed the course with Jane thus far is because I have never been in a relationship that promoted so much personal growth. I'm far from perfect, and being with Jane, we have BOTH been able to tackle some very deep rooted issues and achieve new levels of communication. So yes, we've had challenges and I'm not sure what to do right now and I think she was an asshole this morning, but advice beyond ""Reevaluate your relationship"" and ""Break up"" would be appreciated.",1441140120.0,RebaRockefeller,relationships
"[F27][M27][>2 years]My boyfriend was a cheater and a pathological liar for the first year of our relationship. Shit hit the fan, he’s broken, I might be staying (or going back after a break)","EDIT: Added some positive characteristics as well. He's not a sociopath - he has a dark side (that it seems he has under control now).

Can it ever be “right” to stay with someone who has hurt and disrespected me beyond belief, because of their remorse and willingness to change?

I’m not going into details, but my then “boyfriend” (""boyfriend"" because someone who's cheating isn't really in a relationship) slept with other girls on three different occasions and kissed one. He was extremely deceptive about hiding it afterwards, but it was never planned, never an emotional connection, never girls he was interested in.

Let's say he has a dark side, and that's part of that. In general he's one of the good guys. He cries during movies, enjoys looking at cute animals on r/aww, gives personalized thoughtful gifts, compliments me all day, likes me with or without makeup, is considerate and affectionate, willing to adapt and listen to advice, proud and outwardly in love with me. He's always been like this, but particularly over the last (non cheating) year.

**Revelation:** Happened mid June, two-three months ago. I spoke with someone (with an agenda against him) that told me she heard he'd slept with a girl. I asked him and he denied it, and then I asked the girl in question - she confirmed it. The rumor was only based on the fact that she had been seen awkwardly clinging on him that night, guess it was a 'lucky strike'.

The status quo is that he's living at our place part time and part time at a friend’s house. We’re not officially broken up (for appearances) but a lot of people close to us know about our situation. But we’re not “together”. I’m not treating him the way a girlfriend does. We cuddle some, but sex has pretty much stopped for now (it’s usually a big part of our relationship). As a result of this, I jumped on a job opportunity abroad and I'm moving in three weeks. We might keep in touch and if I'm willing to try again he'll apply for a job there as well and move.

Since the revelation we have learned a lot about him, through therapy and introspection. He has deep seated psychological insecurity issues and also insanely immature. Add a huge pinch of narcissism ala “things always work out for me, I’m invincible, I don’t know the meaning of the word respect"".

**Our story:**
We met, he fell deeply in love with me, I gradually fell in love with him. He seemed like a great guy with ambition, obviously liked me a lot (he told people I was the one very early), treated me great (as far as I knew). After a month or so of dating we became a couple. I had no idea he was a mental case at that time. Over the course of our relationship there have been some signs of insecurity, but the extent of it was not apparent until everything came out this summer.

He’s a good looking guy and has lots of beautiful, great girls showing interest in him. But the nights that he stepped over the line, he was in this weird insecurity fuelled psycho mode, and went on to sleep with really needy and desperate girls, the kind that sleep around for affirmation, not empowerment. Which is sad in itself as in he took advantage of them.
In addition to his extreme ego, his motivation can be summed up into insecurity and need for detachment from me, reestablishing power, being a retard, extreme hunger for feeling validated and wanted.

I have on occasion indirectly contributed to him feeling of lesser value (he easily feels jealous etc (without reason, he just feels easily threatened by other guys that to him seem desirable in some way)), but mainly my “crime” was just being too good for him to believe I was actually in it for the long run. But really, I’ve been nothing short of a great girlfriend - he’s the one with the relationship issues.

Well. **Since the revelation**, he’s made an effort: He’s seeing a(n expensive) therapist, has paid for the therapy sessions that I need in this situation of crisis, even though he's extremely embarrassed he's taken responsibility and stepped up and told his close friends and family about his actions, handled the extreme tantrums that I throw as the result of this situation, read multiple books (including ‘Lying' by Sam Harris several times), had sessions where he’s confessed to other lies he has committed (there were lots of really bad ones, including one incident of cheating), truly understood (and is devastated by) the pain and health risk his actions are putting me through, preaching to his friends about how devastating cheating is, truly talking to people and gaining advice on how a relationship is supposed to work, the moment I end it he’s ready to help me move and make it as painless as possible for me. He's also taken me on multiple expensive getaways and dinners.

He cries himself to sleep on some nights thinking about how badly he’s treated me and how undeserving I am of it. The spare time he's not with me he's either working on himself and his issues or listening to music while writing about or to me. The only thing he wants is to be given the opportunity to spend the rest of his life making up for what he has done.

I believe he understands it now. I believe he has changed (he changed over the entire second year of our relationship, but the revelation gave him a final, giant push), I believe he has everything I look for. He’s now a tender, soft, loving and a proud boyfriend all the time. I think I’m strong enough to trust again at some point and view the first year as a traumatic year for the both of us - if I choose to take him back.

But it’s so unfair when I’ve been the perfect girlfriend, and part of me hates him.

This was kind of ramble ramble. Has anyone else (foolishly) stayed with an immature loser that has done a complete 180 and changed? Or know any stories? How did it go?

"My (27m) wife (25f) said she ""maybe"" wants to divorce; says she hasn't been happy in years","We'll call me Alan, my wife Betty, my wife's friend Cathy.

My wife and I met when I was 23 and she was 20, in June of 2009.  We dated casually for about four months then made things serious.  I proposed after we had been dating for 10 months, a few months after that we found out she was pregnant with our first son.  We married in November 2010, our first son was born in February 2011.

Up to this point, we were both servers and drank or smoked weed 3-5 times a week, had people over a fair amount, stayed up late, etc.  Neither of us had any qualms cutting it out completely, and when my son was six months old we started having a couple date nights a week.  At this point, both of our circle of friends were still partying, so we'd see them but didn't partake.  Our friends grew less and less, I got a good job with great benefits, but my hours are 6a-2p, which pretty much killed any relationship with my old friends.  I'm still at this job.  My wife still works as a server, 8a-3p every weekday.  We're both off weekends.  We moved into a house in April 2012, my wife gave birth to our second son in June 2012.  In June 2013, our second son died through tragic circumstances.

Shortly after, my wife's ""best"" friend, Cathy (23f), left her deadbeat fiance.  I call her my wife's ""best"" friend because, again, at this point our circle of friends has shrunk entirely.  My wife goes out with two of her friends every Thursday on a girl's night, something I have no problem with and encourage.  I like pretty much all of my wife's friends, I just think their schedules and activities are pretty perpendicular to ours.  When my wife's other friend started working more hours, her and Cathy became extremely close.  I recently went out with a group of us, and while my wife and Cathy went to smoke, her other friend mentioned she couldn't get a word in.  I feel like my wife and Cathy put up a bubble that's impenetrable.  They'll cut other people off to start talking to one other, and if my wife and I are having a snuggly moment or whatever, Cathy has no problem coming and starting to talk and stuff.  I don't think she means anything by it or looks for it, but she ""fails to take a hint"" so to speak.

My wife will stay out until midnight most girl's nights, but sometimes until 1a or 2a.  I don't really mind, but on late nights she'll come home with our son around 3:30 and want to lay around for a few hours complaining she's tired.  When I (somewhat pissed offedly) tell her to go nap for an hour or two and I'll handle our son, she tends to be offended.  I used to make an effort to go out with her on some girl's nights, but given it's just her and her friends, I don't really go unless another few guys are going.  Even then, it feels like I'm out of the loop since I rarely drink and don't smoke weed at all.

Last Tuesday (the 8th), she took off work so she could watch the NCAA Tournament.  She was out until about 3a on Monday night.  I told her on Tuesday she needed to knock off going out so late, that her priorities were not on my son OR me, and that I wasn't okay with her staying out so late and that my son and I paid the price for her being lethargic.  She didn't say anything, started crying, and said she needed to think.

A few hours later I come home, babysitter still has my son.  I ask her what's going on and she just seems shellshocked.  I tell her no matter what's wrong we can work it out.  She says she doesn't know.  I ask her if she wants a divorce, she halfheartedly says, ""Maybe.""

She tells me she's been unhappy for years, that I criticize everything she does, tell her her tastes in music are stupid, tell her the books and movies she likes are stupid, and that I make her feel dumb.  That when I go out with them I spend the whole time criticizing her and she can't tell me anything she's excited for without feeling like I'll rain shit on it.  That I'm a very negative person.  She's told me she feels like the only thing she is is a pretty face to me, and I've emotionally abused her to the point she feels insignificant and only feels worthwhile when she's out with her friends.  As an example, often times I'll ask her something, she'll give an answer, then I'll look it up on my phone to verify.  She says that makes her feel like I think she's stupid.  The other day we were listening to a song that mentioned feeling like Switzerland in 1942 or something, and I told her ""Because Switzerland was neutral during WW2"" and she felt really hurt by that as another example.

Point blank, I think she's right.  I sobered up off painkillers and benzos in early 2009 and have steadily been putting on weight since then.  I went from a muscled, single digit body fat 170 to my current weight of 250 (down to 234 since a few weeks ago).  I think I pretty much have no self-esteem at this point and really just take it out on her.  The thing is I don't even hate most of these things, I just pretty much only have my intelligence at this point, and I need to make sure I'm the smartest guy in the room.  In short, I'm a judgmental asshole.

I also somewhat have the feeling I forced my wife to bring up divorce.  She says we'll work on our relationship, but she doesn't want to see a counselor, and she hasn't taken to any of my suggestions of making a list of problems, etc.  I think she meant to drop a hand grenade and instead unleashed a nuke.  I assumed this was residual from when our son passed, but she says it predates that.  I can absolutely see my criticisms predating this.

I also feel like she sees her friend Cathy single, living at her mom's, with a lot of disposable income, and has some weird sort of loyalty to hanging out with her at the drop of a hat.  I don't think my wife has cheated or has any interest in cheating on me, but I do think she misses her youth.  Cathy has recently sworn off serious relationships after her previous boyfriend tried to control her as well, so she's gone full into ""Men are all assholes and undependable.""  I know the prevailing thought would be Cathy is coercing my wife, but Cathy will literally tell my wife I'm one of the few decent men she's ever known, what a great guy I am, how obviously in love with my wife I am, how we have the perfect relationship, how I'm a sort of dad to her son, how I'm a great father, etc.  I don't think Cathy is intentionally sabotaging my relationship in anyway, and I do not want my wife to stop seeing her.  My wife doesn't have many friends, and she has never had a truly close female friend.  I also feel like my wife is somewhat infatuated with Cathy (in a non-sexual way) and a lot of this will die down when Cathy begins a serious relationship again.

In the five or so days since our big talk, our relationship has improved just by talking things out.  We haven't been intimate, but I've been giving my wife full body massages, something I used to love to do (and she loves to receive) but haven't done in a few months.  I don't know why I stopped.  My wife continues to plan things far in advance (planning an October family vacation).  My problem is now my self-confidence in our relationship has shattered even further.  I don't really know how to be around her, as one day we'll be physically engaging and the next the air is thick with tension.  We had a cookout last night and I drunkenly asked my wife if I needed to be worried about her relationship with Cathy.  That feels like it pretty much pushed back any progress we've made.  My wife also said she does not have fun with me because I'm so judgmental, but that at the cookout she had a great time and reminded her of the ""old"" me (possibly because I was drunk?).

I'm just not really sure what to do at this point, I don't even know if I'm looking for solutions or looking to vent/rant or whatever.  More than anything I want to turn my attitude around.  I've been hitting the gym the last two weeks and look to be down to 220 by June, then 200 by September/October.  I've stopped automatically critiquing shows/music, something that's been surprisingly easy to stop since my first thought has never been to shit all over something.  I guess I was just embarrassed to like things like Duck Dynasty etc., and it has felt nice to bond with my wife over some of these things.

My question is:  is my situation salvageable?  Keep in mind I'm posting so my wife is going to look like shit and I'm gonna look like an angel.  What steps can I take to change my attitude?  I'm seeing a psychiatrist starting this week, my wife has said she may go to a session or two with me.  She's never actually been in counseling, so I think when she sees it's not about conflict resolution and just about empowerment, she'll be game.

tl;dr:  my negative attitude has driven a wedge between my wife and I, I've unconsciously emotionally abused her, and she ""maybe"" wants a divorce",1397437182.0,badhusbandthrow,relationships
I [17M] caught my mother [mid-50sF] cheating on my father [mid-70sM] about 3.5 months ago during one of my major depressive episodes. Unsure what to do now.,"Throwaway because school friends know my main account. Huge apology for how long this is. I have a lot to get off my chest.

**Lots of Background:** Like almost every teen, I have an incredible contentious relationship with both of my parents (married 21 years). This isn't helped by the fact that both my mother and I suffer from depression. 


I would consider myself much more emotionally closer to my mother. She was the first person I came out to as gay, we've always been pretty touchy-feely, we like to read together, etc. She does guilt-trip me a lot, though: ""You don't love me anymore,"" ""When I'm old you won't care for me,"" and so on. She also (probably rightfully) gets angry at me when I get angry at her for little things, like when she slaps me on the arm while laughing at a movie. 


My dad and I are fairly close, but not emotionally. We have a lot of similar interests: theater, opera, old cars, politics... He's very old but still pretty sprightly, and we have substantive conversations about current events more often than I do with my mother. 


So, my sister [20F] and I have always been aware of the problems in our parents' marriage. They had plenty of screaming matches and fights in front of us, for example. Also, this is my dad's second marriage: he's quite old, and had a son [40sM] with his first wife. My sister told me a long time ago that our parents' relationship began as an affair, but when I asked my father about this he grew defensive and didn't really reply. My sister also said (keeping in mind that this is two, three years ago) that my mother's had an affair during this marriage, but again, unsure if that's true.


When they're supporting each other, they're the most loving couple in the world, age difference be damned. But they fall out over the smallest things: just yesterday, they had a full-blown argument because my mother didn't want to go on a bike ride with my father and an all-male group of his friends. Or (one of their most common disagreements) my mother will be saying something, and my father will just start to walk away. 


It's been especially rough these past two years, because my sister's been across the country in college and I've been the only thing between them, while also dealing with mammoth mental health issues of my own. 


My parents are both medical professionals. My father is an employee of the state, and my mother has a private therapy practice built into the ground floor of our home. We're upper-middle class, my father makes a little more than my mother but she does most of the finance stuff; they can afford to pay for my sister to go to an expensive college and for me to go to a private high school.



**The Occurrence:** I take public transit to and from high school, although almost every day my mother will meet me at the bus stop and walk home with me. One day, owing to a special schedule, I was able to come home about two hours before I usually can. So I took the bus home and came in through the back gate, without letting my mother know via text.


We have a pool in the backyard (which is on a steep hill), but from the gate I couldn't see it because of the weird angle of the yard. Then I hear feminine moaning, which I instantly identify to be my mother's (our house has thin walls, it's very hard to find a place where you can't hear my parents having sex). My first thought is, of course, ""Gross."" But then I hear a male voice. Problem is, my father's working today, and doesn't get home until 8pm. It's about 1:30pm. 


In shock, I manage to sneak through our large backyard and avoid being seen by my mother, but I basically see her having sex with a completely unfamiliar man (granted, I don't know most of my mother's friends). I get in the house, get up to my room, and text my mother nonchalantly, ""I'm coming home early today, be there soon.""


Not five minutes later, she's in the house with the man, they're getting dressed and drying off, I only hear bits of their conversation but it's along the lines of ""I'm so glad we did this,"" ""See you soon,"" etc. I'm kind of angry, but more than anything unsure of how I'm feeling. A lot of times, my depression manifests as an emotional numbness, so I was unsure if I was angry/disappointed/sad/whatever.


My mom goes into her office for a moment, I go back outside quietly and re-enter the house as if I'm coming through the back. She greets me, completely normal, how's my day, etc. I'm being pretty cold, you know, monosyllabic, but she knows that I'm depressed, so I don't think it stood out as especially noticeable. Then, I tell a BS story about how a long-time couple at my school broke up because the girl was cheating on the boy. It was completely untrue, but I wanted to test for her response. I said something like, ""I think that's completely unforgivable."" Her response? Nothing. Total poker face.



**Aftermath:** I don't speak at all to my mother for three days, before I text her that I know what she did. And then I kind of go crazy. I find it a lot easier to talk about my feelings through writing than through speaking, so I just go off at her, a lot of my anger also informed by my pre-existing depression. I'm basically screaming at her: a lot of ""I'm never going to spend time with you again,"" ""How dare you,"" ""It's your fault that I'm depressed,"" ""You're a bad mother,"" ""No no no no no."" A big, big mess. She's alternately begging for forgiveness and acting like I need to let up, saying that it was a one time thing, a mistake, I know that she and my father were having trouble, etc.


I then come up with this idea that I want to go to a nearby state over the summer just to get out of my hometown. Since I'm a minor, I ask her if she would take me. She agrees, of course, thinking that I'm forgiving her a little. Those negotations fall apart instantly. It's back to me screaming at her via text, while also screaming about depression and my feelings in general. (School had gotten pretty unbearable by this time as well.) 


And then? It slowly stops. I think I caved because I needed someone to turn to because of my depression, and with my sister so far away, it was the only other person to whom I'm really close: my mom. It's been three months since then, and we're essentially back to normal, except I don't say ""I love you"" anymore or let her touch me affectionately like she used to.


And I feel awful about it. My dad doesn't know, and if he knew, my guess is that things would crumble. Moreover, we'd get into a fight, because I've been sitting on this for so long. My depression (which is pretty tame right now) would flare up again, and a house situation which has been essentially stable since summer began would totally fall apart. Like, everyone is more or less happy with each other right now (my sister's traveling all summer, but there's no animosity there either


And what would my parents do? My dad isn't likely to go back to the dating scene, he's over 70 years old. Neither of them would ever consider living somewhere else. My mother has a private practice IN OUR HOME. My father is making a major career shift next spring. I don't know the intricacies of divorce proceedings or the splitting of assets, but knowing how my parents operate, it would induce total meltdown in at least one of them.


I also do have my general life situation to consider: I'm about to apply for college, and my dream school is very expensive. This is really selfish thinking, but I'm sure a disastrous home life would only make applying that much more stressful, and the financial situation regarding college could get sticky if a divorce was to occur. 


Reddit, I'm so, so torn. It feels like it's been so long since it happened, and I thought that I would be able to move past it, but I'm really stuck on it. I feel awful for my father, angry at my mother, unsure about the future... essentially, all over the place. I feel like a coward, like I'm letting my mother ""win"" by treating her so normally: I've read so many posts on this subreddit where people cut out cheaters. I never got that energy rush of empowerment: I slunk back to my mother because I needed someone to hold onto during a period of instability. 


It's a shitshow.



**tl;dr**: Accidentally caught my mom cheating while I was in the middle of a major depressive episode. Freaked out at her for a while, but let things go back to normal because I needed an anchor during depression. Months later, and I'm feeling awful about everything. What do I do?

"[UPDATE] Me (24M) with my girlfriend (23F) of 4 months, thinks I'm gay","I've posted 4 times now.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/31cxgs/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_3_months/), [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33hlbi/update_me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_4/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35u3uy/my_24m_girlfriend_23f_doesnt_trust_me_and_thinks/?sort=new) and most recently [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36ebpf/update_me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_4)

I just thought I'd let everyone here who has posted know what's happened in this situation.

I love this girl so much and she couldn't be more wrong about me. We went to a bar last night, I needed to see her and have a talk. She got more paranoid because I did a double take at a DJ and when we were buying drinks I was looking around for a place to sit, I saw a couple sitting in a quiet area, she said I looked at the guy first. How she can come to such a conclusion I don't know because I saw them both at the same time.

Anyway, she said she is convinced I'm gay. I kept pleading with her, mostly because I can't stand the thought of losing her over something so wrong. I feel so infuriated with the whole situation and I guess the frustration builds over time. She'll end up with a lying jerk one day, I just know it. Weird thing is she was making out with me and wanting to be intimate even though she thinks I'm gay. She told me it's because she's attracted to me.

Anyway, later that night she sent me a text. We're done for good. She said she is 100% convinced I'm gay, I'm a man in denial and her ""Intuition is in overdrive"". She says I have a ""wandering eye"". Anyway, [this](http://www.southfloridaconnects.com/know-the-signs.html) is the kind of website she relies on. Notice how the site talks about the woman's intuition being in overdrive? Wonder where she got that from.

She pointed this paragraph out to me:

""When a man and woman walk into the room together, who does he look at first?  Is it the man, and how long does he look? Does he stare subconsciously?  Tries to hold the other mans gaze? Does his eyes follow the other man across the room.""

Anyway, it just annoys me she can be so gullible and stupid. I've never seen anyone so influenced from weird churchy websites on the internet that completely have no scientific basis for what content they produce and clearly have a vested interest in selling products on their 'empowerment store' and so forth. She's actually really academic so it's surprising to me.

It's really frustrating that the woman I've fallen in love with has let these kind of websites dictate our relationship. I never realised someone could be so immature like that. You'd think someone else would just respect one's identity and not tell them who they are and feel.

But anyway, I guess it's over for good. And I think everyone was right here, ""don't date crazy"".

tl;dr - Girlfriend thinks I'm gay, pretty sure the relationship is done now.",1432595965.0,fofeeee,relationships
Me [29 M] with a strange situation with early relationship [27 F],"Hey everyone, looking for some advice...anyway started dating this girl in early Feb.  We went out for drinks and then got dinner five days later on v-day (low key). Went out again for bowling the next week. Date #4 I home cooked her a meal.

After dinner we made out, moved to the bedroom, fooled around, no intercourse but I got her off and she texted me this the next day: ""Hey, I had a great time last night! You're amazing!"" Text some and then Sunday, I called asked her out for date 5. I forgot it was the Oscars and left a VM but after the show she texted that she would love to hang out sometime this week.

Anywho, we each got busy during the week but she texted me Wed. that for the first time in a while she was free all day Sat. I suggest doing something touristy and she throws out the art museum. We hit that up and get dinner after.

Following dinner we walk her dog. During the walk I tell her that I've had a lot of fun this last month and that, regardless of where she was, I don't feel comfortable personally meeting new people after this many dates. Pretty standard, 5-6 dates / month is usually when people figure that stuff out. Especially when your dates have all been 4+ hours.

Her response makes this a strange situation. She said that she loved hanging out BUT from her Women's Empowerment classes she realized she has a hard time saying no and that until she learns to say no she wasn't sure she could be in a relationship. She says she hopes we can still hang out and we'll talk later.

So normally the 'lets be friends' thing is a ripcord situation but I found myself really liking her and can't imagine why she would text me such a compliment or initiating what appears to be our final date if she was starting to cool on me. Thus I'm confused and reaching out for extra advice.

Thanks!

"I'm [26F] a dancer in a local group, and during a sexy performance a fellow dancer/friend unknowingly gave a ""lapdance"" to my boyfriend [24 M] of 1 year, she's been acting strange ever since","Hello, reddit. First time posting here, but I lurk all the time. I'm sorry if this is long or if there's some useless fluff in here, but I am SO BAD at social situations and I thought I'd just include EVERYTHING.

A bit about me for context and why this might be bothering me so much: I've grown up in a really conservative household and never really developed a sense of self until I went to college. I learned that I truly loved music, dance, and performance, and changed my major to theatre. I love it, I've never felt better and, even though my family practically disowned me, I've never felt more at home and loved. I met my bf in school, he's an interior design major (I hope I don't get any nasty PM's about this, he is very sexually interested in women... I only mention this because it has happened in the past on reddit), and we're head over heels for each other. He's my first boyfriend, but he's perfect really. We both have depression, but it's being maintained, and we're both going to therapy. I joined a local ""empowerment"" dance troupe the year before I graduated. Of course I consulted my boyfriend, as the performances were known to be not quite stripping, but kind of crossing a line. He seemed more excited to see me find a group to fit in with and maybe find some confidence in my body and self, and happily agreed to all the ""sexiness"" involved. 

I've never really had a bunch of friends. When I joined this group, it was a safe haven. They were all super sweet, lovely ladies that helped me along, and made me feel so included and good about myself. Even with the poledancing bits and skimpy outfits (some girls perform in literally less than a bikini, but I wear a one-piece swimsuit with lots of glitter and sequins), I felt comfortable and totally stoked for our first public dance performance. Now, our performances are not only poledancing and jiggling our bits, we all take our performance very seriously and believe the sexiness adds to the dance, and is not the center.

Onto the issue. I'm particularly close to Chloe, a woman my own age and so similar to me that I'd call her a friend. We're both pretty shy and we've never really hung out, but we do text and send each other stuff on fb. 

This would be our third performance. It included a bit where a few girls go out into the crowd, perch carefully on the arms of the chairs that the guests are sitting in (if you've ever seen Blue Man Group, they did a bit like this and the whole performance was sponsored heavily by them), and give a bit of a ""lap dance"". I was to stay on stage and continue that portion of the dance. As always, we had a tiny but supportive and lovely, encouraging crowd. My boyfriend sat right front and center, never a smile not on his face when I looked over to him. 

At bit where the lapdances were given, Chloe unknowingly picked my boyfriend's seat to do the dance on! She was assigned to do the front, so I don't blame her and of course once I saw, I giggled and just kept dancing. I didn't pay much attention until the lapdance portion was almost over, and when I looked over my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. I think Chloe noticed as well, because she dismounted earlier than she should have and headed back to the stage.

She noticed me grinning at her and gave the universal ""what?"" sign that we have. Like, is my boob hanging out? Wedgie? lol. But I danced my way closer to her and told her in her ear that that was my boyfriend. Her eyes got wide, her hands whipped up to cover her face, and she stopped dancing entirely. This kind of messed up the rhythm, and another dancer bumped into her and it took only seconds to correct but everyone wondered what was going on. She told me what feels like a thousand times that she was sorry and through all this, I was just giggling and telling her it's ok, no hard feelings, no worries, etc.

After everything got rectified and the performance ended, she avoided me while we got dressed and ready to go home. My bf came backstage to give me some flowers, and she avoided him especially. It seems like she gave everyone the cold shoulder, because she's usually pretty chatty after such an exciting show, but she just grabbed her stuff and left.

I asked my boyfriend, ""hey, how about that dance huh?"" and he just nervously laughed and explained he just wanted to watch me. Even though Chloe is much thinner, has bigger breasts, and nicer hips and legs than I do (I'm not trying to put myself down, these are just facts. I'm 20 lbs overweight and short haha), he said he just wanted to watch me. He said he didn't feel ""violated"" or anything, but that it was a bit weird that a random woman was just all over him. Now that I think back, she was a bit more ""hands on"" than we had gone over in practice. But mostly we laughed it off, got ice cream after, went home and everything was fine.

Or so I thought. I texted her about 2 days after, asking her how she is. Not even thinking about the incident, to be honest. She never responded. At practice a week later, which was more of a relaxing planning time for the group, she sat as far away from me as possible, avoided looking at me, didn't really contribute to discussion at all. When we picked our theme for our final show, she didn't even vote. At this point I'm noticing that she doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. After practice, I went to her and just said hello, asked her how she's been. She looked at me, dropped eye contact, and just said ""fine"". I didn't really know what else to say (socially just... not there as I said lol), I just said ""oh, well, alright. See you later.""

I texted her again today, 2 days after practice. She hasn't tagged me in the usual dumb videos on facebook or sent me any funny pics like she usually does. She doesn't respond to me. My boyfriend says she's probably embarrassed and just can't face me right now, but I feel like whatever issues she's going through could easily be talked through. I came to Reddit to get an objective opinion on this, I promise I tried to give an unbiased depiction. If anyone had any advice, I'd appreciate that.

**tl;dr**: I'm a dancer with a troupe of other ladies, and one of them during a performance unknowingly gave a lap dance to my boyfriend. She immediately apologized, it was mostly funny to me and there's zero hard feelings. But she's been avoiding me at practice and such ever since.

"My [20F] GF loves me [21M] and i love her but she has emotionally blackmailed me twice, very badly. How healthy is my relationship?","Hi all,

Im having a 2 year relationship with this amazing girl. She got the looks, the brains and we have an healthy amount of stuff in common. She treats me very well and I also treat her very well. We spent a lot of time togheter, at least 4/7 days a week and we have been looking to find a appartement togheter and plan to share a backaccount.  Besides that we have friends in common and our parents also like us and eachother a whole lot.

But, here comes my problem. She is incredibly controlling and not in a way i think i can handle it any longer if it continues. We are both in college and she is doing her study a little quicker than i'm doing. Because of this, she can freak out of exams i didn't pass or when im not studying hard enough. It isn't an angry freakout but a very concerned freakout. She also can get very concerned if i go out late, go to parties or just hang out with friends.

This has escalated two times because i had plans for that evening. I was at home and ready to leave to go to friends, she stabbed my car tire with a knife so i couldn't. I wasn't aware she did this so after a quick tire change i still went. That same night we had planned to spend the night togheter, she told me she had done something very wrong and after a while told me about the tire. I didn't get angry i just got confussed and went home to sleep alone. She told me the next day she was very sorry and didn't know why she did this.

The second time, i left her house because i didn't feel like sleeping with her (i've had sleeping problems which are thankfully fixed). She was so upset i couldn't stay with her that she locked me up with her and hid the key. Fortunatly she wasn't smart enough to remember i had a spare key and as she needed to go to the toilet i left to go home. She called me when i was home to say sorry and she didn't know why she locked us up, she was very upset and wanted me to come over again to calm her down. Obviously i didn't feel like doing this and she hold her breath (mentally) until she fainted. I was absolutly shocked she could do this. I called paramedics to check on her and the day after she apologized for everything.

After these events we talked very much about it. She told me she loves me so much she couldn't think of me not being around. We are both very stubborn people and because of this we argue a lot. This never escalates but she told me several times that she would rather die than see me leave her. This only happens if i don't agree with her on something and thats where the controlling part is most visable. Only when i totally do not agree with her she can lose her mind about it. I'm sometimes afraid of what she could do to herself when i don't agree with her, but this has never been a reason to agree with her as i am my own person with my own mind and perspectives.

Even though all of this has happened I still love her. But here comes part two, i met someone else. So there's this other girl i've met, just to clarify i haven't done anything that could be considered cheating, great girl, real fun to be with. I've had an instant ""click"" with her and she told me she had the same with me. We both have agreed about not meeting on purpose because we think it's not fair towards the fact i still have a girlfriend and she has a boyfriend, but we sometimes run in to eachother.

She had made me wonder about my current girlfriend and i am really uncertain what steps i should take at this moment. My GF is great, but she does have some kind of problems which can lead to really bad situations. And this other girl just made me realize there are so many other fish in the sea.

Reddit, please help.

Tl;dr: I have a GF with clear mental problems but i still love her eventhough all the shit she made us go through. Another girl has shown up and now i'm questioning my love for my GF.

EDIT: Well, i guess i've been blind. Thanks for the comments.

**EDIT** 2: So, today i broke up with her. I took her to a public place to break up to avoid a scene or a bloodbath as some of you predicted. She took it pretty well i guess? She said she saw it coming which made her scared. I also recommended a psychologist for her to attend to deal with her fears.

After i read all the posts and my own story again i too got scared by the story, i guess it sometimes takes a night sleep and an overview to understand the situation. I'm spending this and other nights at a friends place just to regain my breath. Good night all.",1452388030.0,3strikes_im_out,relationships

Whoa, I was not expecting such a huge response. Although I can't respond to each of you that commented, please know that I'm reading all comments, and I appreciate everyone's input very much.

I plan on sitting her down and having a serious discussion with her about it in the very near future. The general consensus appears to be that I'm being reasonable about this, which I'm happy to hear, so I'm hoping that I can sway her or at least get her to be more respectful/understanding.

-----

Hi everyone. My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 1/2 years. As of late, my interest/involvement in competitive gaming has put a big strain on our relationship. Posting this on a throwaway.

Just to provide a short backstory: I am a 23-year-old adult that lives a pretty adult life; I have a full-time job, I pay bills, I work out regularly, I go out with friends/my girlfriend on a regular basis, etc. I graduated from college this past May, while my girlfriend is still in college. We do not live together.

When I was in high school, I spent a great deal of time gaming competitively. At no point in time, do I feel, did I neglect my responsibilities or the real world; I had plenty of friends at school, I had a good social life, I wouldn't consider myself ""obsessed,"" it was just something I really enjoyed doing.

Around the time my girlfriend and I started dating, the next iteration of the series I played most came out, and I didn't enjoy it very much. As a result, my competitive playing habits died down for a while, although she was very much aware of my interest and my history with the game and the competitive scene.

Fast forward a few years, to this past October. A new game in the series releases, and it's the most fun I've had playing a game competitively since I was in high school. On top of this, there is currently an ongoing world-wide tournament for the game with an astronomical amount of money in it's prize pool, something that it's competitive scene has never been exposed to. Naturally, I get involved, and up to this point, my team has been doing well. We have a legitimate shot at qualifying for the next phase of the competition, a 16-team invite-only event, which would qualify me as a ""professional"" player.

The qualifying tournaments for this championship are held each Sunday, and it generally takes up my time for a few hours (in the afternoon. Before/after I'm done playing, we're together). Because the tournament is team based, I also would *like* to be on to practice with my team for at least a few hours during the week. 

Once my girlfriend learned of this time constraint, she let me know just how unhappy she was with me playing, calling it (among other things) an obsession, unattractive, something for 12-year-olds, a vice, ridiculous, etc. 

Now, initially, I thought that I might've been neglecting our relationship to game, and made an effort to rectify this by basically *only* playing/practicing when she wasn't busy/there wasn't any opportunity for us to be together, or on Sunday. However, I've learned that this wasn't the problem, and that she instead ""hates it because of the fact that it's any sort of time commitment at all."" In her opinion, video games serve no purpose other than to kill time when you're bored, and she feels that me setting aside planned time to play is absolutely insane.

Make no mistake, we see each other very regularly; she has been home from school this past month (she goes to school about 30 minutes away, so we can still see each other fairly often regardless), and while she's been home, we see each other on a daily basis. We go out on dates, we set aside time for our shows, all that couple stuff.

I feel *ridiculous* for getting this stressed out about gaming, but at this point, it's putting a serious strain on me and our relationship. Any discussion of it causes an argument, and I consistently feel like I'm doing something wrong when I'm playing. I cannot plan to practice with my team at all anymore (which also stresses me out, because I'm leaving them high-and-dry) unless I'm 100% certain that she won't be around. It's not even that we have plans to be together, it's the fact that if we *could* be and I'm instead playing, it's a problem. Several times she has said to me, ""if my friends ask what you're doing, am I just supposed to tell them that you're at home playing? That's so weird,"" inferring that she feels embarrassed by what I'm doing.

I personally feel very embarrassed by the entire situation, but this is something that I feel passionate about, genuinely enjoy doing, and am good at. I'm beginning to feel pretty bad about myself for having this as a hobby. I love my girlfriend to death and am in no way, shape, or form choosing competing/gaming over her; if I needed to, I would give it up in a heartbeat. I'm just incredibly frustrated by her apparent unwillingness to let me enjoy this hobby that I am invested in and am doing well in.

Am I doing something wrong? Should I be giving this up? Is there anything more that I can do to ease her concerns about me playing? Any outside perspective helps. I'm really open to any suggestions, I've tried really hard to compromise with her without feeling totally controlled.

Thank you for offering your time to provide some insight. It's really appreciated!

**tl;dr - I am on a borderline professional-level competitive gaming team. Girlfriend hates that I game competitively because she doesn't feel like gaming should have any sort of time commitment. It's something that I enjoy a lot, am passionate about, and don't want to give up. I don't neglect our relationship, nor do I think gaming is replacing our relationship in any way, so I feel that I should be able to enjoy this hobby without having to feel embarrassed/like I'm doing something wrong.**

Just to be clear, this is NOT something I am pursuing as a career choice. This is something I am doing on the side that I enjoy. Money/recognition or whatever comes with gaming competitively would be a perk, but right now, I am doing this as a hobby.",1452781979.0,onthistoaskyouthings,relationships
"Me [31 M] with my friends [28-32 M/F] 5-20 years, I ruined my personal relationships during a time when I had a brain tumor. I am healthy now but the damage cant be undone. I don't know how to move forward given the things i've done.","I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in my frontal lobe about 3 years ago. For a good chunk of the year prior to my diagnoses I behaved in ways that resulted in almost everyone in my life cutting me off. I was vengeful, malicious, angry and just mean for no reason. I did not have a ton of friends but the 12 I had at the time were basically my family. I grew up in care so i had no actual family but I met most of my friends in college and we were very close. Over the course of about 9 months though, i managed to completely ruin all but one of those relationships to the point where everyone completely hated me.

For context of the type of person I became: I got kicked out of my friend's wedding (where i was a groomsman) after trying to sleep with his wife during the reception. Then because I felt that I was the one who was wronged (horrible, i know) I made a fake video of her 'cheating' and emailed it to his entire family a month later. And to top it off made some bots to spam her social media (she is a professional youtuber so this actually impacted her career) with claims that she was a cheater and worse.

And this is not the only horrible thing I did during this time.

It got to the point where no one in my life would have anything to do with me. I got fired from my job for my behavior. I got kicked out of my apartment. I was basically exiled because of who I had become. The the only person who stuck around did so because they knew me the longest (we were in a home together as kids and wound up going to the same college) and recognized how extremely out of character I was behaving. He eventually forced me to have a scan (not by choice of my own, but after i was hospitalized due to a fight I started) which revealed that i had a grade 2 tumor in my frontal lobe.

I was treated and am now fairly healthy again. Since being treated my personality has mostly returned to the person I was prior to having the tumor and my horrible behavior has subsided.

During the time I had the tumor, I did not recognize that my personality had changed and was not able to recognize just how horrible of a person I was being. I believed that I was in the right even when I did things that any normal person could see was completely wrong. I was honestly, a huge piece of shit.

Looking back at the things I did now I am able to see just how terrible I was. Since being diagnosed/treated I have tried to fix some of the damage I caused by my behavior but I am not sure I can. Most of my friends still hate me. Even though I have been told that the tumor likely impacted my personality during that time, they (understandably) cant separate the person I was during that time from the person I was before/am now. Most of my friends have been willing to meet with me to hear my apologies/ accept the things I have offered to try and make up for what I did to them but they still dont want to try and have a relationship with me again. They say damage was to bad to ever undo.

I know that I need to accept this and that they are right. If i were in their shoes i know i would feel the same way. I am trying to give them space and accept that there is a huge chance that none of these people will be willing to be in my life ever again but I am having a very hard time with that. I am also really struggling accepting the fact that, I was that type of person. The way i think now i cant believe that i was capable of that level of cruelty. I sometimes feel like i don't deserve to have another chance. Tumor or not at the end of the day, I am the one who did these things. The tumor may have impacted my self control but it didn't give me the ideas of what to do to begin with. I did that on my own.

I dont have anyone to speak with about this. My one friend keeps saying that it was the tumor and that i should just forgive myself and move forward. But i don't know how to do that. Should I should keep trying to repair my relationships or just accept that I burned them and can undo that? Any advice at all is appreciated.

TL;DR: a brain tumor reveled just how awful of a person I am. now that i no longer have the tumor, i dont know what to do",1567278813.0,wejksone,relationships
My [25F] boyfriend [26M] of 2 years is obsessed with healthy eating to the point that it's hurting our relationship.,"We live together.

He's always been pretty conscious of what he eats. He never EVER eats something that's even remotely unhealthy or processed. I'm a balanced eater. I eat healthy for the most part but sometimes I also treat myself to unhealthy things every once in a while. I have a healthy weight (I'm 135 pounds and 5'8"") and I'm pretty active and exercise a lot.

At home we don't usually have problems. I'm fine with his healthy food. When we go out its a little strange because he's not flexible on where we can eat but he usually finds a salad or something that he can eat. It's never been a major inconvenience so we've always worked around that.

I'm beginning to notice that he's getting more and more obsessed. Last month I bought a little ice cream for myself (I know he doesn't eat) and he was all over me about how unhealthy it is and how it's gonna make me sick and all those things. The other week I cooked myself some good old fries and he was like that as well. Forget about ordering Pizza or fast food, that will probably give him a heart attack.

Yesterday morning my brother texted me and asked if we're free that night to go out. My sister and her boyfriend were also coming. The plan was to go to this new BBQ place which has amazing ribs and chicken and enjoy ourselves a great dinner. I asked my BF and he said that he won't come. I told him that the place surely has salads or other things that he can eat but he says it's the principle that he's against and watching all of us dig into trash food will make him sick. OK. So I went without him. We had a lot of fun.

So at night he asked if I enjoyed filling myself with crap. I told him that I had a great night. He showed me this article titled ""you are what you eat"" and told me that I must be proud of myself. He also asked me to stay away from him until ""I process all the crap out of my body"" as he said that I make him sick. He slept on the couch. He left to work early in the morning, just left me some fruits in a plate and a note ""please eat these for lunch"".

Now I'm worried. Eating healthy is good but obsession is bad. I don't want to be controlled on what I eat and I sure as hell don't like being told that I'm eating crap or the fact that he wants to stay away from me until this food is out of my body? That's insane.

We've talked about this problem in the past and never seem to get to a reasonable place, but this time he took it too far.

Are there any suggestions?

My (33F) boyfriend (36M) went to a festival without me and I can’t move past it. ,"**FINAL UPDATE - we are now in the process of separating and he will be moving out of the house we share. I am absolutely heartbroken, and so sad that it came to this in the end, but ultimately I know that it’s the best choice for both of us. Thank you everyone for your advice, and to those of you who took the time to personally reach out and check in with me. I appreciate it** 

My (33f) boyfriend (36m) went to a music festival without me, and I can’t get past it and want to end our 6 year relationship

Hi Redditors! First of all apologies for any issues with formatting as I’m on mobile.

So as the title suggests, my boyfriend of almost 6 years recently went to a festival without me. 
We have spoken throughout our relationship about wanting to go to this one together, as neither of us had ever been to that particular festival and would love to experience it together, but then he only arranged a ticket for himself, behind my back, and went without me.

The ticket purchasing was done through a girl that I’d never met, and this particular festival requires you to sign up, exchange registration details, and all that jazz, so it was pre-planned, months in advance that she would try and get him a ticket and he would try for her, but at no point did he also give her my registration details, which he’s had for our entire relationship, or discuss this with me AT ALL.

He then proceeded to hide the above from me, not mentioning that he had other people trying for a ticket for (only) him - and when the purchaser was successful (getting tickets for this particular UK festival is like winning a lottery) he then failed to mention that someone else had bought him his ticket, and allowed me to believe that he got through to the payment page and ‘panicked’ thus only securing one ticket… I was trying to buy tickets at the same time but couldn’t even load the page due to the volume of people trying for tickets.

Over the next ten or so months and particularly the week before the festival I was very upset about it and the closer to the festival it got the more upset I became, a few days before the festival I made him aware of how badly the whole situation has hurt my feelings, and he then came clean about how he secured his ticket, which made me feel even worse as it meant that he has essentially lied to me for months about it instead of just being honest. I was gobsmacked. 

Whilst he was at the festival I received flowers, and a postcard saying how bad he feels, and he has apologised since coming back, and apparently it's all good now…

Since his return from the festival, I have also found out that the two girls he went to the festival with slept in MY tent with him (in their own pods) and he did drugs with them the entire time (he doesn’t have his own tent so borrowed mine) for the whole weekend, and despite multiple discussions and conversations via phone and text through the time he was there, he failed to mention this to me, and i think thats super shady, but he's now upset that I don't trust him.

I feel so, so, so unbelievably angry, hurt, and quite honestly mugged the fuck off, and he is acting like everything is ok and fine and I’m finding myself incapable of even sleeping in the same bed as him.  This is not the first glaring instance of selfishness in our relationship, and I’m seriously considering calling it quits over this as I cannot seem to get past the bitterness and resentment that I’m currently feeling. I find myself constantly snapping at him, not wanting to talk to him, and pretty much avoiding him altogether. I’ve slept in the spare room since he got back, and I’m seriously considering ending the relationship over this.

I don’t mind him going to things without me, and we both regularly meet friends or attend nights out without each other present as we both believe and encourage that having our own lives and interests is healthy. However, the particular festival I am talking about has been on my bucket list forever, and for the entire six years of our relationship we have talked about experiencing it together. So I think I’m pretty justified in being hurt by all of this. 'Hurt' doesn't even begin to cover it tbh.

We’re attending a wedding in France in a week’s time, and I think once we’re home I need to deal with this; whatever that entails. I can’t continue to live like this. 

Basically, I’ve been made to feel that this isn’t really that big a deal and I’m being silly, so I thought I’d ask the Reddit hive mind for some advice and opinions. So, Reddit, how do I move past this? Do I want to? 

TLDR - how do I move past my boyfriend being dishonest about doing something alone, that we’d always planned to do together?  

**UPDATE** - thank you to (most) of you for the kind words and for your advice, opinions, and even the comments calling me an idiot - I’ll add any further updates as things progress, but it seems that the writing is on the wall here and I need to make some serious decisions in the next few days. I thought this one was for life, so I’m struggling to say the least. Updates to follow for those of you interested. Thanks again ❤️

UPDATE: My (25m) girlfriend (23f) has been weird since having a seder at my parents',"[Link to the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1csuyby/my_25m_girlfriend_23f_has_been_weird_since_having/), TL;DR for the OP: My non-Jewish girlfriend came to my family's seder and my parents overexplained all the Jewish concepts, and then she seemed more distant but wouldn't discuss it with me.

It's been a weird fucking week, so I apologize if this isn't the most coherent update.

After I posted I really appreciated the advice noting that I might be making some assumptions about what was upsetting my gf, ""Lily,"" so I asked her if we could talk and that I just wanted to be open with each other. She agreed to meet up on Friday after work, when we normally would anyway for a date. 

So I made a nice meal for her at my apartment, her favorite thing that I cook (this creamy, lemony pasta dish) and then afterwards I tried to just kind of have this open-ended conversation about what I noticed (e.g. how she's been more distant) and was there something wrong? She was really hesitant, just looking kind of nervous, and then she just kind of blurted out that the seder made her uncomfortable.

Okay, so that's what I thought, right? So I figure, okay, let's talk this through. It turns out that while she knew I was Jewish, she didn't think I was ""so Jewy"" until she came to the seder. I cringed and told her that the word ""Jewy"" was inappropriate and she did *not* like me saying that.

There's a part of the Passover seder where we say ""next year in Jerusalem,"" just like a kind of hopeful attitude in light of the Jewish diaspora, I think? Anyway, she said that she found that part really inappropriate given the current war in Gaza. I told her that those things were not connected; my family has no real connection to Israel and the seder is a hundreds (maybe thousands?) years old tradition that long predates the modern state of Israel. She didn't seem to care about that.

So, I finally asked her if she had a problem being in a relationship with me given my Jewishness. She emphatically stated that no, she loves me. But it was a shock and she ""needs time."" That really threw me though, and I asked her what she needs time for, but she didn't have a real answer.

So I went to my parents for the weekend to just kind of get away, since I wasn't sure what all this meant. While I was gone, I got an alert on my phone that an AirTag was following me. I found it hidden in my car. I called Lily and she denied it was hers but I was pretty sure she was lying since she's not a good liar. Finally she admitted she was trying to see where I was going and if it was to the TEMPLE?!? I honestly haven't been inside a temple since my Bar Mitzvah almost 13 years ago.

Anyway, it should go without saying that I ended it. I blocked her on everything. I destroyed her AirTag, too. No clue what the fuck is wrong with her, but... it feels antisemitic, I guess. Wish I had a happier update. I thought she was the one, but fuck me I guess.

TL;DR My girlfriend made some vaguely antisemitic comments and tried to track me to see if I was going to a synagogue, so I ended it.

EDIT: Due to popular demand, this is the recipe: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1589-linguine-with-lemon-sauce

I double the recipe and use more cheese and lemon zest than it calls for, but not exact amounts... just kind of go with the flow on adding more.

You all made me laugh with your desire for this recipe during a time when I am feeling really fucking low, so thank you.

EDIT 2: I guess the post got locked? I was mostly okay with the discussion I saw, but maybe that's because the mods took care of some bad shit before I saw it. If that's the case: thank you, mods!

I finally read through all (I think all) of the comments. To those that made me laugh: I sincerely thank you. I'm very stoned right now eating sour gummies and laugh-crying at stupid movies. That's my coping mechanism, and I recognize it's not healthy, especially with my Ashkenazi gastrointestinal issues.

Anyway, to those who think this was in issue she had with my being religious: I don't think you understand what Judaism/Jewishness is. I'm not religious, I'm actually an atheist. Her issue was with my cultural background. She didn't see my culture because I guess it's not on display all the time? I mean, I think I have a pretty stereotypically Jewish sense of humor, but maybe she didn't put that together. Anyway, the more I think about it the more I realize what other people said here is true: she wanted me to be generically white, and when she realized I was more ""ethnic"" than that, she had an issue with it. That's antisemitism, full stop.

I did end up telling some mutual friends the full story, and one of them told me they actually suspected she might have some conspiracy theories rattling around in her head which, if true, is like... fuck, I don't even know. He thinks she was attempting to track me because of some Protocols of the Elders of Zion crap she might believe, like she was hoping I would lead her to the secret meeting? I honestly hope that's not true, and I take it with a massive grain of salt.

To those who think this was a made up post: I fucking wish. I honestly feel like maybe this is a weird dream I'm going to wake up from and my perfect beautiful girlfriend will still be there. But she's not who I thought she was. It's all too real.

I'm not going to wade into the political quagmire except to say that my ex-girlfriend's issues with me was about way more than a war thousands of miles away. I don't actually think she and I probably disagree all that much on how we feel about that war. If you can't separate those things and see the antisemitism behind her actions and attitudes and language, then you are part of the problem.

Hope you all enjoy the lemon pasta!",1716242061.0,PesachProblems,relationships
GF's (27F) family always makes comments about what I (28M) eat. I told her I was done eating around them including not coming to Thanksgiving.,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Our relationship is strong except for a recurring issue where her family is... difficult and she is not always great at standing up to them/for me. I am a large man; not fat or anything, just very tall. I play 2 recreational sports and also bike a lot in my free time. As a result of this, I eat quite a lot. 95% of the time, I eat healthy but in larger quantities, and the other 5% of them time I will occasionally pig out. I am not unhealthy in the slightest; I have been to a doctor recently and he affirmed I am in good health and have a good healthy lifestyle by all measures (weight, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.). So I know I am doing everything right. However, my girlfriend's family constantly needs to comment on what and how much I eat.  
  
  
  
They live 2 hours away so when we see them, it is typically us staying at their house for a whole weekend where I am at the whims of whatever the menu is. If I eat more than one serving of something, then the Mom or Sister will make comments or whisper to each other about how I am eating into their leftovers the next day, or how it's unhealthy for me to have a second cookie or something. This is even if there is a ton of food, so I know I'm not eating their whole week's budget of food or anything. I have also tried bringing my own snacks so I am not infringing on their supply of food with my extra eating, but this doesn't work either. I will sneak a granola bar or an apple or a bag of chips from my bag and they will find out (I think they search the trash or something) and let me know that it will spoil my appetite, or ask whether the food Mom made wasn't good enough for me. My GF and I also will do our own activities out of the house during the day sometimes when we visit, so I have occasionally had us stop at a fast food place if I need to eat some fries or chicken nuggets or whatever out of the house. Whenever we come back, the Mom or Sister will make comments or ask if we ate anywhere else while we were out, and GF gets nervous and confesses because she feels guilty or doesn't like lying to them. So after 3 years of this, I get really sick of being attacked for the amount I eat even when it barely impacts them and I know I'm eating an ok amount. It has gradually gotten worse over time.  
  
  
  
My breaking point came last week when it was GF's mom's birthday so we met at a restaurant in the middle between us one night. I ordered a burger and fries while everyone else ordered salads. And immediately, GF's mom, sister, and aunt all started commenting about how the burger looked unhealthy. I stood up for myself and said that I had biked dozens of miles that week already so I think I can treat myself to a burger, to which the sister said that one unhealthy thing can wipe out weeks of working out, which I dismissed. I was hoping that would be it, but every like 10 minutes someone would make more comments. So I'm getting really annoyed. I eyeballed my GF numerous times to be like ""back me up here"" and barely got anything. Finally, the food came and my burger was perfectly normal. Not giant, not dripping with grease, not filled with unhealthy toppings. Just a normal burger. But everyone was like ""wow that thing is enormous! You really shouldn't eat that in one sitting, it'll clog your arteries and you will feel terrible afterwards. Seriously, that thing is so unhealthy, I think I would die immediately."" I decided that I was done after that. I sneaked away to the bathroom and stopped at the front of the restaurant to ask for a box and to pay my part of the bill early, came back to the table, and announced that I was going to get going as I didn't feel well and asked my GF if she wanted a ride home or if she was going to figure out another way home. She got super embarrassed and said that she would come with me if I wait a few minutes, so I got in the car and ate my burger in there while I waited like 10 mins for her to come. We left and she cried the whole way home. I felt bad that it hurt her feelings but I'm at my limit and I told her I was done going to events where we eat food with her family, and if that means that I don't come with her when she visits her family then that's just the way it has to be. I said I would be skipping Thanksgiving at her parents' this year.  
  
  
  
Since then, she has barely talked to me but hasn't really fought me on it at all. I know it hurts her but I have to stick up for myself here. I'm sick of being treated like I'm some fatso who eats like garbage when I know I live a healthier lifestyle than any of them. I'm not even that mad at my girlfriend. Obviously I would appreciate the backup but I know she's scared of her family since they are all kind of bullies, so I'm just not going to allow myself to be present at these opportunities. Whatever fallout happens as a result of this is just not my responsibility. Am I handling this right? Is there a nicer way I could have said everything or been gentler with my girlfriend? I don't want to hurt her feelings but I have the right to protect myself if she won't.  
  
  
  
tl;dr - I eat a lot because I am tall and active. GF's family make a lot of comments about how much I eat, to an insane degree. I got fed up and have announced that I am not going to any events where we eat, including Thanksgiving.",1700510617.0,Super_Key_1405,relationships
Feeling Unheard and Undervalued: Is This Really How a Healthy Relationship Should Feel?,"TL;DR : I(F 27)’ve been with my fiancé (M 36) for a year and a half, and while we have a lot of love and good times, our relationship has become filled with intense arguments, defensiveness, and distance. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells and struggling to be heard, and it’s making me question if this is what a healthy relationship should feel like. Would love some advice on what to do next.

We’ve been living together for about a year. In the beginning, everything felt really good, and we were so close. I know he loves me deeply, and when things are good between us, they’re really good.

However, around six months into our relationship, we started fighting more frequently, and lately, our arguments have been intense. There’s a lot of yelling and crying, and I feel like every little thing sets him off. I’ve started feeling anxious about my actions, constantly second-guessing myself to avoid setting him off. Sometimes he reflects on his behavior and apologizes, but more often, I feel like he’s become avoidant. When I try to express what bothers me, he gets defensive and starts gaslighting me, often raising his voice, shutting me down, or trying to make me feel like I’m wrong for being upset. If I cry, he threatens to get even angrier, which just makes things worse. All I really want is to feel heard and understood, but it feels like he’s doing the opposite.

Physical affection has also changed. He seems less interested in being close, and I often find myself waiting for him to come to me. If I try to talk to him about this, he somehow finds a reason to get angry at me, and it escalates into yet another fight. He often reminds me of all the good things he does for me instead of addressing the problem I’m bringing up, which leaves me feeling unheard and discouraged.

For the first time, I’m seriously considering leaving, even though I love him and know he loves me and wants a future with me. It’s just hard because I feel like he’s been trying to “re-educate” or “correct” me in ways that feel harsh and critical, and it’s starting to change how I feel about our relationship. I do my best to make things good at home, but he doesn’t seem to be putting in the same effort.

My best friend suggested that I should wait things out, not get angry with him, and focus on staying in my feminine energy—she thinks that will eventually help him change since he loves me. But I’m starting to wonder if this is really how a healthy relationship should feel.

I’d really appreciate any advice on what to do next. Thank you for reading.

"Husband gave me an ultimatum, what do I do?","My(27f) Husband (26m) told me he wants to start trying for children in January. I have multiple health problems I'm trying to get under control; breathing issues, possible fibromyalgia, thyroid condition, and severe anxiety, so my first focus is primarily on myself rather than growing a tiny human at the moment. I've been seeing doctors the past few months to try and figure out my breathing issues and I've told him that I really don't think I'm ready for this yet. Our relationship has been pretty rocky too so I want to make sure we're in a healthy enough relationship for kids. 

The thing is, he told me that I have until January to agree, or thats that. He said that we aren't getting any younger and he doesn't want to spend this time with me when he could be spending it with someone else who could give him a child. His reasoning is that his father isn't well and he wants his dad to have a grandkid before he passes, which as of now, he'll likely be around for a little while yet. He said this to me two nights ago and I'm still at a loss. He has told me in the past too that if we do separate, it's harder for someone my age to find a partner then it is for him, because statistically older women have a hard time. I'm 27? That's not too old right??? I just don't know what to do. Do I just call it? We're set to do couples counseling in 2 weeks but I don't know if I have any fight in me after that remark. I'm afraid to be alone again since I met him right after a really abusive relationship.

TLDR: husband is making me choose between getting pregnant or divorce.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support ♥️ I'm overwhelmed by the response. I will try and update as things move on, likely in a new post somewhere, I haven't spoken with him yet but plan to soon.

To add context for those asking since I cannot respond any more- we have been together for 5 years through college, married for 1. Children were a consideration but never an ""exactly at this time or by this time"" deal. Id love to have children when my body is ready if I can, and I understand he has a right to leave if I cannot, but the ultimatum and rude remarks were my biggest concern.

Fiancé (26M) has invited his best friend (25F) on his family vacation instead of me (25F).,"Hi all. I am really struggling with trying to understand this situation, and I would appreciate some insight outside of my immediate friends/family. Throw away account for privacy purposes.

Just for some back story, I met my fiancé (we'll call him D) at the tail end of my freshman year of college. We were friends for a couple of months before finally admitting that we had feelings for each other, and we have been inseparable ever since. He has known his girl best friend, S, since his early years of high school. D introduced me to S early on in the relationship, as she also attended the same university as us. I always trusted D, so I never had a problem with their friendship. I have platonic male friends that I still keep in close contact with, so having an issue with it would be hypocritical in my eyes. I even developed a friendship with S over the years of us knowing each other, so getting to understand her on a personal level has also made me feel more secure in their closeness. I got engaged to D this Summer after years of dating, and I personally believe we have a wonderful and deep love. We typically have very healthy communication, and even if we do not see eye to eye on things we tend to come to a good middle ground eventually.

Fast forward to now- his family typically does a vacation every Spring break. The past few years, I have not been invited because ""only close friends or spouses are allowed to join in."" Now, I admittedly have felt a tad bit hurt by this in the past but I always let it go because it is not my family vacation, and I assumed he had no heresy in who he could bring along unless they met the requirements. So.. you can probably imagine how excited I was thinking that perhaps I could tag along this year, to spend some time getting to know his family much better and getting to spend some extra time with him that isn't the apartment or city we live in.

Friday night when he came home from work, he started to casually bring up how his family picked a certain beautiful East Coast beach as their destination for this year's family vacation- WHICH, BTW, got me so excited because I thought he was about to segue into inviting me. Rather, though, he mentioned that this year he was bringing S along to his family vacation. I think he could see the confusion and devastation on my face, because he immediately started to say that he wanted to bring me but his family has known S for much longer than they know me, and that they love her so they don't mind paying for her to go on vacation with them. S has also had a tough year with her grandfather passing away, so he wants to take her on a trip to make her feel better and get her mind off of things. I was genuinely so shocked and so hurt that I excused myself to the bedroom, locked the door, and sobbed my eyes out. 

The next morning, D came and spoke to me, saying he was sorry but that this vacation ""probably won't be that fun anyways since my teen cousins are coming"" and that he would make it up to me by taking me out on a weekend trip sometime during the summer. I tried to explain to him that it hurts that he is putting another woman above me, his fiancee, even if it's for a ""not fun family vacation"". I have never been able to attend one of them before, and finally just when I think I'm about to be included, I'm just.. not. The vacation will be a week long, and I'm already starting to feel insecure that he has picked another woman to go on a tropical family vacation with. I truly can understand how he wants to be a good friend and be there for his best friend while she's grieving a loss, but also at the same time I could never imagine inviting one of my guy friends on a family vacation over my fiancé. It perplexes me, I suppose. I'm so confused on what to do or how to handle this situation. I want to respect his decision because I can appreciate that he can love and cherish another woman platonically, but at the same time I feel so betrayed that while he is on his family vacation with another woman, I will presumably be sitting at home feeling extremely left out. I've also been battling the urge to look through his messages with her; I do not want to invade his privacy but I can't help but begin to think that if you invite another woman to a vacation with you, there is probably more than just friendship in the pot. I don't really know how to bring up any sort of grievance I have about this without sounding like I am jealous or clingy, and quite frankly I'm not even sure if I should be upset. 

Should I be concerned that he invited her over me? Or do y'all think I'm overreacting?

TL;DR: Fiancé invited his girl best friend to his family vacation because his family loves her and she is grieving a loss, and it has made me extremely anxious and concerned for my relationship as a whole.

"[UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?""

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

How do you try to fix a relationship when the issue is that you cannot communicate in a healthy way? ,"I (28F) cannot communicate with my boyfriend (30M). We’ve been together for 2 years. We live together & split bills 50/50 - he’s working two jobs right now, finishing his masters degree. I am thinking I will stay until I’m ready financially and he’s finished with his program at the very least. Neither of us would be able to afford our current living situation if we did break it off.  Is this fucked up? On my part? For staying despite having come to this conclusion? Knowing how I feel and not telling him feels wrong to me, but I don’t really know what else to do, how to handle this. 
 
Unfortunately more times I’d like to admit, I empathize with my abusers, and it takes me far too long to leave. Thankfully he’s not as bad as those have been in the past, it does seem more like normal dominance type relationship riffs but the way he flips on me , the way I feel the need to make myself small is not something that feels healthy. 

TL;DR;
My conflict ultimately is  I don’t want to “give up” on him if it’s something I’m just not seeing from his perspective because we are great in a lot of ways.

"I don't see relationships in healthy ways, can you please give me some advice?","TL;DR i am 17M and my partner is 18M and we've been together for about 10 months

Hey, so im put this in a different subbreddit a bit ago but the feedback i got from it wasn't the best so I'll guess I'll try here?

To get to the point, I'll never ever see a relationship in a healthy way, in always feel that someone has power over the other. In the relationship currently in i see myself as having more power than my bf and with my ex I always felt he was the one with more power and I was ok with it(my story with my ex is a whole other can of worms).

Another issue i have been having is my over reliance on my attractiveness, to me it is a primary factor and it's like I base my self worth on it? I feel like this is because I grew up ugly and i wasn't treated nicely because of it, now I am much more attractive, I assume the bullying got the idea that attractiveness = worth drilled into me.

To go back to my fist point, my bf is attractive and is tall but not too tall (5'10), obviously this isn't an issue for me, I love him but I have spoken to much more ""attractive"" guys, guys who were like 6'5 and rock hard abs, I decided to go for the guy which had the most charming personality, which we should all do but I cant help but feel superior for doing so, like I feel like I have a leverage over him because if the types of people I have had the chance to get with. Obviously I would never cheat, I just can't stop thinking of how easy it would be if I did.

I do know that the solution is probably to distance myself from him and work on self improvement but I just don't want to, what if he breaks up with me during that time, and its hard to bring up like ""I  need some space because I can't stop thinking about how much more dominant I am than you and how easy I could cheat"", he is a truly understanding person, recently my father passed away and he'd been nothing but helpful, but I feel like that would be like his limit.

I know this is a bit long and maybe rambley but if you guys want to ask any questions and have any words of advise please reply with them,

Is the way my girlfriend (21f) and I (18m) argue toxic? How should I go about dealing with my own feelings of anxiety and rejection whilst encouraging a healthy relationship.,"
My (18m) gf (21f) is currently in exam season, and very stressed, which I understand, because of this her and I haven’t seen one another in a few weeks. She said something on FaceTime about my personal appearance that hurt, I waited a few hours to just see if it would go away, and it did, but than she brought up how she doesn’t like that I don’t jokingly be mean to her back. And that she “likes it.” I explained it’s not how I work, and I’ve tried hard to not be like that to her, which made her feel bad, I said it was okay that she did it, just to leave out stuff about my body (then blurting out the example from earlier in the day), and insecurities, she almost immediately said she was going to go and hangup off FaceTime, I sort of freaked out, and she said she was just stressed because of exams. Afterwards she texted me saying it was the first time in days she cried, and when I tried to comfort her she only responded with “yep” and “it’s fine.” Before saying “okay bye” and now ghosting me, she is studying so that’s probably in part of it, but I’m incredibly anxious as I usually am after our fights when we’re not in person, I never am able to reassure myself, or get the reassurance from her, that when I bring up things she’s done that have hurt me, I always feel like I’m a bad person, and that I’ve hurt her. Her response is always to leave the call, and my feelings of anxiety don’t leave for days after. I don’t know how else to deal with my emotions of anxiety and rejection, or how to bring my feelings up to her.

My husband told his ex affair partner about our sex life while we are reconciling. ,"My (38f) husband (38m) and I are working on our marriage following his infidelity which went on for close to a year. We are in marriage counselling and have weekly sessions to help rebuild a healthy, happy fulfilled marriage. We have been together for 16years and have a 4 year old who we love.

Prior to his affair, we had a dead bedroom situation. I’m not making excuses for him at all but sex was about 4-6 times a year, during his infidelity we never had sex. The dead bedroom was mostly due to me just being tired and generally having low libido.

We are about 6 weeks into reconciliation. My husband recently had to break NC with his exAFFAIR partner for reasons I won’t go into here. They messaged a little bit.

During the text exchange she asked him if the two of us were having sex again, he told her ‘yes’ and then added ‘I wasn’t expecting it, it was all her’. That part is true, I initiated sex which I never have done but I have also read about this being very normal post affair where the betrayed want to ’reclaim’ the relationship. I was confused about wanting to have sex with him. The affair partner then wrote ‘enjoy your transactional sex‘ clearly making reference to the fact that I was never initiating sex in the many years of our relationship. My husband, instead of defending me wrote ‘she might as well have pissed on me afterwards’. Does he sound resentful towards me? He tells me he loves and cares for me but I am horrified by what he wrote.

  
EDIT> because a lot of similar questions are coming up.   


-The dead bedroom came about because of general low libido (I just don’t want sex as much as my husband and can imagine his 23year old AP wanting it constantly so he gave in like a weak man) I am now working on it and initiating sex regularly. He also emotionally cheated on me twice prior, over a decade ago,it I acted my self esteem.

- The AP blocked him after he made contact about his injury, I know I should have told him no, I said I wasn’t happy about him contacting her insisted he wanted to check in. She blocked him after saying she wanted to move on and wished him well with R.

"My (27F) boyfriend (28M) of 7 years wants to take a 1 year long ""break""","Hi. I'm sorry for my spelling as English is not my first language. Me (27F) and my BF (28M) have been together since we were 20 y/o and for the most part our relationship was pretty good. We can comunicate pretty well our wants and needs so it's been a very healthy relationship.

A couple of days ago I noticed something was bothering him and I asked. He said he doesn't feel as good as he used to. He's not ok with where he is now in his life. He doesn't like his job, his economics, his life basically. The only thing he said is good in his life is me, and that doesn't make him feel fulfilled.

We've been talking nonstop this past few days, also we have cried too much. At the beginning I was scared because I didn't want the relationship to end but the more we talk the more I feel I don't deserve this situation. I know is not a me problem, is him, his life, his goals. I cannot think for him, I can't be happy for him.

I'm exhausted, at the end of every conversation he ends up telling me that even though he wants to discover himself, the only thing he's sure is that he doesn't wanna live without me, but then the next morning he wakes up confused with what he wants again. He's came up with this idea of take a 1 year long ""break"" so he can find himself and then come back to me.

I honestly think that's awful, and I told him that I love him so much and probably in a year I will still love him the same but I don't deserve that, I won't be sitting with my arms folded just waiting, I'll probable recent him a lot, so that won't work for me. If he stays he stays and commit to work things out in therapy, and if he leaves it's done.

He said the most important thing for him is my happiness and I deserve a concrete answer of what his choice will be, he wants time to think about it, like a month. But now I'm asking myself what do I want? Honestly him pulling this stunt destroyed somehow a little of my trust in him, so I don't know if now should I leave either way.

I [21f] am worried that my new healthy lifestyle is going to ruin my relationship(s),"Health and fitness has always been very important to me, but when I came to college all of that went down the drain. I go to a very rigorous school and there is very little time for me to take care of myself. The entire student body is incredibly sleep deprived and unhealthy to be completely honest. This year I have more work than I ever had in my entire life, I spend about 12 hours a day doing my work. 

So, to make time for myself, I decided to fix my sleep schedule. I now get up at 5am, hit the gym, go to class early to get work done, try not to work past 9pm, and then I'm in bed between 9:30pm and 10:30pm. I've tried to cut down on partying, which I used to do a lot, I've been eating incredibly healthy again, etc.

I feel great and I look great.

The one thing that I don't feel good about though are my relationships... mostly with my boyfriend [22m, of 8 months]. We both attend the same school but since we have so much work we don't see each other that often. Mostly, we see each other nights and weekends. He's a late riser and night owl, he isn't too concerned about his health either. He obviously has a lot of other great qualities, otherwise I wouldn't be with him. 

The thing is that I feel like I can't see him, or spend the night with him, without compromising my schedule. For example, I spent the night with him last night and set my schedule off by two hours, which is everything, especially since I'm trying to get the bulk of my work out of the way so that I may actually be able to spend some time with him this weekend. Even then, he had trouble falling asleep when I wanted to go to bed, and I woke up and left to start my day before he was even up. I hadn't seen him in a week either. 

Now, I feel like I'll only ever get to see him breifely at night, or in passing during the day, which is what has happened during the week.

He also likes to party every weekend, which I'm trying to cut back on. If I ask him to compromise and spend a night with me I feel like that's asking too much of him, and if I compromise and go out then I'll feel awful, physically, and stress wise because I won't be 100% when I'm doing my work, which I need to be (and I rarely get any free days on weekends either).

As far as my friendships go, a lot of people in my major are in the same boat... the only way around it is to do subpar work, or do it all and go out anyway, therefore compromising their health and ability to work later on. I don't see my out of major friends very often, but they have significantly less work than I do. The sleep schedule is also affecting my ability to see them.

I know that I'm doing what's best for me health wise, but relationships and friendships are incredibly important to me as well. Obviously this was a decision that I made, I don't want it to be the wrong one.

Edit: For those of you who believe that this is crazy or that I'm prioritizing something over my boyfriend and that I should compromise.. look. The school that I go to is one of the best in the world, they remind us everyday that they are not teaching us to work for others but to have others work for us, to start our own companies, businesses, products, etc. To acheive that, you have to work at a certain calibur, which I am. Sure, the class hours aren't that insane but we do virtually no work during that time, it's all reserved for afterwards. To be able to handle this, I need my body to be healthy, and I have had some serious health issuses in the past and I work hard to stay in good shape. The best investment that you can make is in your body. I love my boyfriend, but to be honest, he doesn't have the same priorities. He wants to be successful, and I think he will be,  but right now his priority is partying. I am not ready to break up with him, I don't think that's fair. I want to give it a few months and see if we can still make this work.

The title sums it up. I lost sight of the respect my girlfriend deserved in our year of being together. I did not cheat, but I learned the hard way that words, even with the best intentions, can do just as much damage. I’ve crossed boundaries, used dismissive/annoyed tones, and said things out of pure emotion and immaturity that truly had no meaning, without considering how this may impact my partner. Yes, we are young and there is A LOT of growing up to do - especially on my part. She chose to stay, and we’re working on healing and growing together and it hasn’t been easy of course. What’s keeping us together is we both genuinely believe we are meant for each other - we’re both committed to each other. when things were great, they were REALLY great and it’s been one of the happiest and healthiest relationships we’ve both been in. But at some point along the way i let my inner child take over and let me become someone that i am shameful of. She’s hurting and her emotions are everywhere. It’s been hot and cold. I know the best thing i can do is be patient, show up for her everyday and be persistent in making sure my words are followed by actions, and takeing accountability for the damage i’ve caused. Rebuilding a relationship is something i feel everyone faces and is a test to not only the commitment to each other, but a test to our individuality - can i become a changed man for the woman id give everything for.

About to months ago this random woman(he knew her I didn’t) walked up to my very drunk bf and ran her hand down his back and asked how he was doing in a very. My bf was very drunk didn’t notice. Well I snapped on her and told her not to touch him without consent and she started asking like “are you his gf, his wife?” I answered yes and repeated what I said at first. After that she walked away. Well I stressed myself out about this woman because come to find out he was trying to introduce us earlier but I was in the bathroom. So in my brain she walked up like that to provoke me. Maybe I read it wrong but it felt that way. Before her there was his ex that got in between us at the bar while him and I were talking and pushed herself on him. I ignored it at the time but it upset me that he just did nothing while she was pressing boundaries. So that all added up for me because these random woman are becoming a common occurrence(sorry 1 time is fine but 2 is when I start getting paranoid)

UPDATE: I (28F) am getting tired of my bf (28M) getting upset over inoffensive things that I say,"Previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cvljeo/i_28f_am_getting_tired_of_my_bf_28m_getting_upset/).

Well, Reddit. We broke up. Two weeks after I posted the above, we got into a fight because I was surprised to see him in the kitchen when I had just saw him in the bedroom. I said, ""Oh you're up!"" He responded by rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders and demanding, ""Is that a problem?!""

I said ""Of course not, I was just surprised!"" and went on to do the laundry. He left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. He gave me one-word answers when I tried talking to him. I guessed he needed time to himself so I went into the living room to call my friend. As I was talking to her I heard him leave the apartment. 

After I finished talking to her about 20 minutes later, I went out to find him playing Pokemon Go. I tried talking to him like normal and he kept giving me one-word answers, not looking at me. I finally asked him what was wrong. He said nothing. I said to tell me. He said he didn't feel welcome in my apartment because of my ""tone.""

For listeners who heard the previous fights, you'll know my ""tone"" and the ""wordings"" of my sentences were things that triggered him a lot. Even if they were innocent statements like, ""I thought you were traveling on Monday?"" or anything else that somehow threatened him and made him immediately defensive.

Unlike other times, where we would launch into a fight that would last hours or DAYS because he would insist I would have a tone, I would say I didn't mean it that way, and apologize, and it wasn't enough, this time we managed to pass through it fairly unscathed (and due mostly to my patience, if I may say).

But then later that day he told me how annoying my indecision was. That I could never relax. 

That night I wanted to see some friends for a few hours because I had only interacted with him for several weeks at that point and I needed some social time. He said that was fine--he's always said that would be fine (as if I needed his permission). So I went out.

25 minutes away from home and nearly at my destination, he messages me about how he feels lonely, he's going back to his home country soon, he wishes I hadn't gone out, we don't have much time left together, we were supposed to spend the whole day together (this was news to me).

It takes a lot of effort for me to keep down the anxiety and just enjoy time with my friends before going home.

We argue for two hours about it, even though there are several times when I point out he's repeating himself, that HE said he didn't even know he would feel that way so how could I anticipate his needs? It occurred to me that he often would do that--wait until it was too late to change something, complain about it and make it my fault. Like when he accused me of leaving him alone to fend for himself at a party for an hour (it was 15 minutes, I was watching the clock knowing he was insecure and didn't like social gatherings), or that I was with my friend he didn't like the whole time (I talked to my friend for less than 5 minutes the whole night because I had one eye on the clock and the other on my boyfriend). Why didn't he get up and talk to me during the party and tell me that? Why did he wait until the party was over and we were home and he held it over my head? 

Or the time we got back from a tropical island and he says he ""wishes we could have relaxed more,"" when I was the one who planned the trip and was driving and why did it not occur to him to tell me at any time he just wanted to relax somewhere? I thought it was relaxing because he was just in the car talking with me and playing Pokemon Go anyway while I was doing the driving, was it really not that relaxing?

Or that time he was mad at me ALL day because he thought I was mad at him and I had made some remark that he took personally (shock), and he didn't tell me why he was being quiet until hours later and after I pryed and begged for him to tell me.

This kind of shit. All the time, you guys, holy shit.

The day of the reckoning. He finally leaves my country. He's back in his home country. Messages me how he feels like he failed us and he doesn't want to be home. I respond compassionately but say he needs to get rest because he's been traveling so long and hasn't eaten and I wanted to give the discussion of his feelings the time and love they needed and we couldn't when it was 3 AM there and he had to be up for work at 7 AM.

He goes cold. He goes to bed.

He wakes up. Still cold. One-word answers. I'm used to it now.

But now I'm fed up. 

I call him out on his behavior. I tell him I'm sick of him going hot and cold with me. He says I didn't ""comfort"" him the way he wanted me to. I reiterate what I had said. He reiterates that it's not what he wanted to hear. 

We break up later that day. We're both sad. Despite the bad times we had good times too, otherwise it would have been easier to let go. I'm disappointed in myself for saying I still didn't recognize the emotional abuse. I said we could try again. He says we couldn't. We both cry. We both apologize. We both thank each other for the good times.

Next morning. He wakes up. Pissed. Mad I didn't give him a chance. Mad he has nothing to show for our relationship. Mad at all the sacrifices he made.

(Sidenote: after the last fight I posted about, he had said to me: ""I look at all the sacrifices I've made and I wonder, what have you sacrificed? Are you worth it?"" To give you an idea, that is the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me, and it was the beginning of the end of our relationship. I opened up my home to him, cooked him vegetarian meals, tried to introduce him to other people so he didn't feel lonely, took him out and explored the country with him, tried to cheer him up, planned all our trips...it was NEVER enough. What was I sacrificing? My time. My energy. My mental health. My personal freedom. My social time with my friends. Everything.)

It was like he always expected the worst in me, and would only ever see what he wanted to see.

So we haven't talked since, after he chewed me up and spit me out and accused me of never listening to his feelings and always blaming him for everything. That I should have told him how I felt sooner, that I should have heard him out on an apology (that he apparently had no intention to actually get better from, just feel bad that it happened at all and repeat the same behaviors as infinitum).
 
If any of this rings true to you...please get out. I started reading, ""Why Does He Do That?"" since I saw it recommended on this sub several times a day. It's opening my eyes to what I put up with. The unhealthy behaviors. The emotional abuse. The mental exhaustion I have suffered.

I won't lie. I miss who he was in the beginning. The sweet guy. The promises. The love. The care. The above-and-beyond romantic gestures. But they had vanished only months into the relationship--after we exchanged I love you's--and then the jealousy came out. The insecurity. Nitpicking what I said and how I said it. Even how I apologized wasn't good enough. His controlling tendencies. He demanded I not talk to my friends about it—even after the break up he asked that I not talk to our mutual friends about our break up. 

I could never make him happy.

Please, please, if you read this and think it reminds you of your relationship...please know you can do better. I am single now and have been the last two weeks, but the moment we broke up I felt relief. I felt a weight being lifted off of me. I have my time again. I can do what I want, when I want, without worrying how he will feel or how he will react or how long our fight will last or trying to manage the anxiety he made me feel.

It can get better. 

Look up “signs of emotional abuse” and click the link with over 60 examples. Google “why does he do that PDF” and just read the first ten pages online. If it resonates with you, then know that you have taken a very essential first step towards a happier, healthier you.

I know I still have some ways to go. I am still trying to convince myself it was an emotionally abusive relationship, that I was not overreacting, that I can't go back, that I can do better, that my future self deserves better, that he was not the one. I had been so sure he was. But I just have to keep trusting my gut. It's hard not messaging him. I feel pathetic for even considering it. I used to be stronger. Maybe I'm still strong. I just have to get it back. Keep practicing. Keep being strong.

Anyway. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr I left my emotionally abusive relationship. Thank you to everyone who messaged and helped me see what he was doing was not okay. Thank you for the brave people who post about their unhappiness with their spouses and helped me see things must be able to get better. For making me feel less alone. Just...thank you. &lt;3

Edit: The overwhelming support. I can’t keep up but I’m reading every comment. Thank you for helping to convince me I’m not crazy. Thank you for sharing your own painful stories. Thank you for reaching out and leaving comments or messages to send hope and love. Thank you for your support. You are all lovely people, and I hope you are all enjoying happy and healthy lives and relationships. Take care of yourselves.",1570695815.0,Queen_Of_Ashes_,relationships
UPDATE: My (30M) Fiancée (29F) has discovered a new love of cooking and made me her unwilling sous chef,"[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/)

My original post blew up in a way I totally wasn’t expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it’s been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn’t able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could.

There are a few things I’d like to clear up since they kept coming up:

She is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don’t see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that’s been bugging me about this that I hadn’t even realized.

It is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue.

Her motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn’t overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It’s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don’t want kids. So money is not an issue.

So I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn’t want to talk about it. 

I told her that I’m invested in solving this problem and that if we’re unable to do so we can bring it up during couples’ counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so.

This seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she’s overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit.

When she’d gotten past that I didn’t want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things:

* I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she’s making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy. 
* These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:
    * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.
    * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she’s cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen. 
    * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology.

She said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples’ activity. 

I asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up—about how I was behaving or how she feels—and she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later.

That was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room. 

I felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me.

Ultimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night. 

I have started looking to get a couples’ counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate.

My boyfriend will break up with me if I go to Miami on a girls trip," My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been dating for a little bit over 9 months now. We have a pretty healthy relationship for the most part but this is his first relationship so there some areas that he is still working on. 

We never really set any boundaries from the beginning except that we didn’t want each other going to clubs or bars and he also would say he does not take any sort of disrespect. 

I kinda had to figure out his boundaries throughout our relationship like he does not like me having guy friends or talking to any guys and he does not like it when I accept guys follow requests on instagram or liking their pictures which I totally get so I don’t do it. He also does not do any of that without me asking so I appreciate that. 

He’s very respectful to me and I am respectful to him so we have no issues with that. However, my best friends birthday is coming up in May and she is planning an all girls trip to Miami to celebrate and I told my boyfriend I was planning on going and we had a whole discussion about it.

 He said he does not feel comfortable with me going to an environment like that with my single friends and he wouldn’t do it to me so he doesn’t want me to do it to him. He said if I go our relationship will be over or if we stay together our relationship will not be the same and he will be getting freedom to do whatever.

 I don’t know what to do because I understand where he is coming from but I also don’t want to miss out on my best friends birthday or any other trips that come up in the future.

 He’s been really respectful and sweet  to me and I don’t want to throw the whole relationship away over one Miami trip but I also don’t want to lose my friends because girl friendships are so important to me.

Should I go to Miami or save my relationship?

TL;DR! - My boyfriend says he will break up with me if I go to Miami with my all my girl friends. This is a boundary that if I cross he will not stay with me. I don’t want to miss out on girl trips but I don’t want my relationship to end.

How do I cope with feeling uneasy in a healthy relationship? ,"I (25F) am starting to feel detached and depressed. The man I am with (24M) truly cares for me—I never have to guess, wait, or wonder. He is constantly and consistently showing he cares about me. 

I come from a very complex and long history of trauma both in my childhood and previous relationships. 

I’m used to a whirlwind—the kind of love that parts the clouds and makes the wind sing, but feels like a burning hell the next minute. 

With him, I often feel bored because he’s so understanding. There’s no chaos except for the chaos I create in my head. And I think I’m starting to try and create my own trauma now. I keep asking myself, “why is he so nice to me? Why does he even care? Why does he want to be with me? Why do I deserve this? He doesn’t actually feel this way about me, he’ll change his mind”

I keep feeling like just because some days we are not laughing that much together, that it means the relationship is doomed. (For context—we’ve been together only a month, but I’ve been friends with him for 4 years and I’ve also lived with him for past 6 months. Since we live together I see him everyday, we often spend 3+ hours together at least) 

Why can’t I just let myself feel at peace? DAE that has had this experience have any advice on how to cope with this?  

TL;DR: I don’t know how to be in a healthy relationship and I’m afraid it’s going to cost me the only one I’ve ever had. How do I cope with this? How do I get past it?

"Can people with different love languages have a sturdy, healthy, long term relationship?","My partner (NB, 24) and I (F, 29) (together 2 years) have different top love languages. And while I know it’s unlikely for them to be the same, and you should love your partner the way they want to be loved, it’s causing some issues for us. My highest love language is physical touch. While I can tell them all I want to make sure they do that for me, if it’s not a top love language for them (or even if it’s a low one), it will never be a constant thought to touch me, because they don’t need touch themselves.

Is it possible to have mismatched love languages and still get that need fully fulfilled, when they don’t have a need for it themselves? Will it just be insanely hard work for us both, or is it ultimately an incompatibility issue?

[Update] My boyfriend [28/m] and I [28/f] have differing opinions on what constitutes a healthy relationship,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4caqs1/my_boyfriend_28m_and_i_28f_have_differing/)

Hello again! It's been about month and a half since I posted and wanted to give y'all an update! Thank you to everyone who gave me advice in my previous post!

Shortly, after I made my post, I sat down with my boyfriend and asked him why he felt that disagreements were so bad. He felt that *any* kind of disagreement was an attack, which confused me because I've never used accusatory language or anything of the sort. Typically, if I disagree, I will say things like ""we should dig into this deeper"" or ""I am not sure I agree."" I told him that I am sorry it felt like an attack, but that has never been my intention when we have a disagreement...what good could come from ""attacking"" my partner? I asked him what I could do to make it feel like I was not attacking him and his response was ""I don't know."" At that point, I felt defeated and no longer knew how to address the situation.

For a few days after that, I backed off a bit and didn't bring up the subject again. Things seemed to be fairly normal. We were talking and hanging out, but in the back of my mind, I was concerned about what to do long-term (I was thinking of suggesting couple's counseling if we could not find a resolution). Then, one day, it felt like my boyfriend did a 180 in his attitude. If we disagreed about something, he no longer acted like I was attacking him, he instead addressed the disagreement and talked it out with me. I didn't say anything...and then the following week, same thing (I frankly do not even remember the disagreements, just that his general attitude was completely different).

That same weekend, we went to visit our parents (they live in the same general area) and his mom asked me how everything was going. I told her I noticed that my anxiety levels had gone down because her son was approaching our conversations, including disagreements, differently than before. She says ""oh, he didn't tell you I talked to him?"" Apparently, one night while I wasn't home, he called his mom to ask her something and she brought up the issue regarding disagreements. I have no clue what she specifically said, but the gist of their conversation was her telling him that she and his dad hid any disagreements/fights they had from him and his brother when they were kids, that despite those disagreements and occasional fights they still have a happy marriage of 30+ years, and he needs to be more realistic with his relationship expectations. I was a bit astounded that he listened to her, but he's the kind of guy that needs strong evidence to back up claims, so I guess hearing what I was telling him from someone else was that evidence?

It's been a month now since his attitude changed and our relationship has been much better. I no longer feel like I have to walk on eggshells, my anxiety has decreased, and we've barely had any disagreements, since the ones we do have we're able to resolve without escalating into a worse argument. I can also see a positive change in his general persona, aside from his attitude. He's happier and more relaxed, as am I.  I know it's only been a month, but I can already see this relationship getting much better long-term, especially now that we're on the same page with resolving any kinds of disagreements that may crop up from time to time.

As a side note, to address the comments in my OP regarding going to my MIL for help, I understand that doing so is a precarious move and typically not a good one, but I fortunately have a healthy, positive relationship with my MIL and I had hit a brick wall regarding how to resolve this issue. I consider myself lucky to have such a good relationship with my MIL because I can definitely not say the same about my MIL's in previous relationships. I view her as a friend, not just my MIL, but that does not mean I plan to go to her with every issue...that would be ridiculous. Some of you thought it was done as a manipulation tactic, which I basically laughed at, because haven't any of you hit a point in your relationship where you needed outside help?

Either way, all is well and life is good :)

"Update - is it worth it to try to work things our with my boyfriend, ho is jealous of my stepbrother?","[Original post is here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g367sr/is_it_worth_it_to_try_to_work_things_out_with_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

After I posted, I took some time to read the comments and form a plan. I texted BF, telling him essentially that I needed a bit of space to take a breather and reevaluate. I made it clear that I didn’t want to break up, but felt like I was always being monitored and I wanted to make a game plan to have healthy communication through this pandemic. 

He called me super upset and accused me of choosing SB over him. I told him that it wasn’t about SB, it’s not like I chose SB, he’s literally just someone I get along with who I can hang out with during the pandemic. I explained to him that it was not like I was spending every waking moment with him, I do my homework in the morning, we hang out in the afternoon, and my evening time is divided between the 4 of us (mom, stepdad, SB) and FaceTiming BF. 

BF then accused me of doing special, “boyfriend” activities with SB. He told me that it was always his dream to teach me to drive (he doesn’t even have his permit. Am I supposed to wait around for him to get it?). Also apparently me teaching SB how to bake bread? Which is stupid because I was going to make the bread to begin with, and SB “helped” by moving the heavy mixer, eating half the almond slices, and taking pictures for Instagram. 

He also screamed at me for not moving in, saying how all this would have been prevented if we were living together. I told him that I have no interest in living somewhere that I’m not allowed to be. I can’t afford a fine from bylaw, and if I were to get kicked out, it would be more difficult to find my way home since I don’t drive. 

In the end, I told BF that I would not give up my relationship with SB, who is part of my family and a genuinely nice guy, to ease my BFs insecurities and cater to his demands. I told BF that I needed time to cool down, and that I’d talk to him in a few days. That was all on Friday, and today I reached out to see how he was. He was still pissed at me and accusatory, so I basically told him that this wasn’t working and I want to break up. I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn’t deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family. 

Anyway thanks to everyone who commented. I’m really sad this is the outcome and I’ve been crying a lot, but I’m also kind of relieved.

I [33f] read my husband’s [37m] journal and in it he says that he hates me and hopes I die.,"My husband has kept a semi 
-regular journal throughout our 4 year relationship. He does not keep it hidden and up until now I have always respected his privacy. We had a heated conversation and my gut told me to read it so after he left for work, I did. He wrote several times that he hates me and at one point he said when I was sick he hoped I would die. When I read those words I packed up me and our baby and went to a friend’s where I’m staying now. I took pictures of all the pages. I told him I just need some space to cool off after our conversation and I will be home soon. I booked with my therapist and contacted a lawyer. 

We had a rough patch recently that lasted about two weeks. It was a dark time, but we pulled through. There was no violence, no moments where I was afraid of him, just sincere conversations about difficult feelings. The notes of hatred correspond with that rough patch. The rest of the journal is tame and reflects the man I know and love- mostly little self pep-talks around work and family stuff, goals, habit tracking. 

He has sent me several warm messages since I left. He says he’s glad I’m taking space for myself, that he looks forward to reconnecting when I come home, it’s ok to have little hiccups, that he loves me etc.

I was sure our relationship was over the moment I read that he hates me (or even the moment I felt the need to violate his privacy) but the warm messages and the rest of the journal have me wavering a little. 

I understand the need to blow off steam when things are tense, and journaling is a healthy way to do that. But never in even our darkest moments have I fantasized about his death. Splitting  up maybe, but this feels so sinister. I don’t know how I could ever feel safe around him again.

Is this just healthy venting and I’m overreacting here? Has anyone else had similar thoughts about a spouse that they then got over? Or is this a man I need to protect myself and my baby from? If so, is there anything I’m missing?

Edited to add: the rough patch was about his feelings for another woman. He didn’t cheat, but he did have an inappropriate conversation with her that he fessed up to. The part where he says he hates me was written as a love letter to her. He said he thinks about me dying and being replaced.

TLDR: husband and I had a rough patch and he wrote in his journal that he hates me and hopes I die. Wondering if this could just be healthy venting, or if not, what steps I should take to protect me and my baby.",1707897857.0,Throwaway61011,relationships
My friend [25F] and I [26F] have been seeing the same person [36M]. Should I walk away?,"
I [26F] have been seeing Adam[36M] for approx 6 weeks. We matched on a dating app but I also knew him from the occasional hallway greeting at work. We've been sleeping together since the first date and have hung out at least once a week. 


Several days ago I found out Ashley [25F], a friend of mine, has also been seeing him. They started talking 4 wks ago (2 wks into me seeing him). They went on a date 2 wks ago (4 wks into me seeing him). They had plans last week but Ashley had to cancel. Adam has been very straightforward about wanting to sleep with her during their texts/talks. His date plans with her mirror my experiences.


Adam and I did not have a conversation about exclusivity. Technically he did nothing wrong by hooking up with her but the fact that he used the same formula on her as me bothers me. I don't like that I was the backup option for the day she couldn't make it. Especially since by that point we'd been on dates without hooking up and have had conversations that I wouldn't do with a random fling.


Ashley and I hung out in a couple days ago in a group setting when the whole Adam ordeal came to light. I texted him as soon as I learned about it. The next day Ashley and I met and had a healthy one on one conversation about the situation where she disclosed everything, despite his ask not to. We decided it would be best for both of us to step back - her, because I was developing feelings for him, and me, because I was uncomfortable about things. 


After he'd gotten texts from each of us he confessed to Ashley and me that he'd liked me for a while and wanted to pursue more but was waiting until I was ready and would delete dating apps if I asked. He said he was planning to have a discussion about exclusivity the next time we met. 


I'm not sure how I should approach this. His interactions with Ashley led me to believe he was only interested in something casual. If it weren't a close friend I might be more objective about the situation but with how things have unfolded I'm not sure. Is initiating & pursuing a sexual relationship with another person while in the beginning stages of non-exclusively dating someone you like a red flag? Should I try dating him or commit to backing off? 

*EDIT 1 : yes it was safe sex. I get tested regularly as does he. I confirmed this before doing anything. I wasn't expecting exclusivity and also dated around for the first few weeks we saw each other (all were casual and didn't end with anything intimate). I would be less bothered by things if I didn't know the finer details, if it wasn't my friend, or if he responded to our texts in a way that reflected his actions of dating casually.*

*EDIT 2 : I've gotten a lot of comments criticizing him for not being exclusive. That's not a deal breaker for me, but what bothers me most is his response to being ""caught"". Especially since he's 10 years older than me. Thanks for helping me clarify my feelings, I really appreciate it. Definetly has saved me from future pain.*

*I'm going to bow out gracefully and go out dancing with Ashley to celebrate our friendship. We deserve it for dealing with all this bullshit, lol.*

**TLDR; [36M] and I[26F] have been seeing each other for 6 weeks and had not discussed exclusivity but it was getting serious. For the last 4 wks he's been pursuing FWB with a close friend of mine [25F]. Should I walk away?**",1666802375.0,AngryExGeneticist,relationships
the aftermath of being cheated on while pregnant [UPDATE 10 MONTHS LATER],"this is in reference to the only other post on my profile, [which can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15x07hg/the_aftermath_of_being_cheated_on_while_pregnant/)

If you don't want to read the whole post, the synopsis is essentially that my (F28) husband (M28) cheated on me after 8.5 years together while I was 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.

It's now June 11th and my daughter just turned 8 months old. My water broke and I drove myself to the hospital and then labored & gave birth alone. My daughter was born two weeks early only, and she was completely healthy and had no issues. She is doing AMAZING, and the love I have for her is so all encompassing that sometimes I don't even know what to do. She's a great baby, and is so loved by not just myself, but my dad, my brothers, my aunt - she is adored by my whole family, and because we live with my dad, her birth has brought all of us together closer than we've been in a long, *long* time. I absolutely love being her mom.

My ex husband was served divorce papers in February by my dad, who volunteered to be the one to do it, and our divorce was finalized in May !! The way that my feelings for him changed almost in an instant after I had given birth to my daughter was shocking, but it was like as soon as she was born just the thought of this man disgusted me. He visits for about an hour a week, once a week, and has done since she's been born. We have a parenting plan in the works but every time it's drawn up by my lawyer, he finds something else that's wrong with it and choses to not sign. It's been very irritating having to deal with this man who I once loved and now don't recognize, and watch as he pretends on social media that he is an active, attentive father when I've done quite literally everything for this baby and he does the barest minimum he can get away with.

This next part may be very shocking, but the girl he cheated on me with and moved into an apartment with directly from our marital home ended up cheating on him literally within the same week that our divorce finalized and she was kicked out of his place. It took about a year, but he did come back groveling after all, which was absolutely wild to me.

Now for the actual shocking part of this update: I have met a man !! After spending my entire pregnancy alone and heartbroken, I had sworn off men and relationships and then this one just kind of appeared in my life. I have horrible trust issues now, and it's been really, really hard considering the deep betrayal that happened to me last year, but my boyfriend is the most gentle, calm, understanding guy I could have found. We met when my daughter was two months old and he started taking me on little weekend dates for just a couple of hours at a time, and was always very considerate of me having a newborn (which he reassured me several times over that it was not an issue, and he actually has experience working with kids in the past) and then in March we had the conversation and defined the relationship. In these 6 months, he has met my family and has become one of my daughter's favorite people. I've met his brother & sister in law and when his parents come into town later this month, he's introducing me and we're all getting dinner together. I feel lucky to have this man in my life, and a stable father figure for my daughter, and I am really hoping he is actually who he's been showing me he is. Obviously when my ex husband came to apologize and cry for what he'd done to me, I was already very locked in with my boyfriend, but even if I hadn't been the answer would have been NO.

Our house has not yet sold, and I'm kind of losing my mind about it, but there's nothing to really be done to help that matter.

I know this may sound like revenge corn, but I promise it's not !! Karma has just been working hard for me and my little bean \~ my boyfriend dotes on us and makes me believe in love again; he is so handsome and so sweet and the complete opposite of who my ex husband ended up being. I am really hoping he is a good egg, because I accidentally fell in love with him when I didn't mean to, but I do now know that I was strong enough to leave a marriage with a baby on the way so if he ends up screwing me over, I know I'll be strong enough to leave him too. The fact that my ex's affair partner cheated on him absolutely tickles me, to be completely honest. I'm still living with my dad (+ my two dogs & cat that he abandoned me with during my pregnancy) but honestly it could absolutely be worse. My dad helps as much as he can and loves his grandbaby so much, and it's been so sweet watching him turn into this absolute softie of a grandpa.

I don't know if anyone remembers me/my post or if this update is necessary at all but !! Here it is !! I am big time not in love with the guy who cheated on me, left me, and is an absent father to the baby I grew all on my own and raise all on my own. 

TL;DR  
I am a single mother with a gorgeous baby girl and we are both doing really, really well while I watch my cheating ex husband's life slowly fall apart !!


[edit] I'm not sure why this post is not allowing comments anymore, even from myself !! thank you to those of you who left lovely ones, and who messaged me because you couldn't comment lol maybe I'll do an update in a few years if anything needs updating. also, I realize I forgot to say, neither he or his affair partner stayed working at the same business for very long so after I gave birth and no longer needed his insurance, they both were not working there for me to report their relationship. my ex husband did make sure to take paid paternity leave and do nothing paternal with it, but no, I never got to report them to his boss. so long as he stayed technically employed through the end of the year when my own insurance took over, it was more helpful to leave it alone. Anywho, thanks for all the love to me and my baby girl, and the well wishes with my boyfriend !!

Our rock solid relationship imploded in a single night and I’m completely blindsided,"My partner (25m) is my (26f) rock and I’m his. Literally he tells me that all the time including yesterday. We’ve been together for five years and have a truly wonderful relationship. Always talking, laughing, comfortable with one another. Able to communicate even when we disagree. After I survived abuse as a child and struggled with unhealthy romantic relationships in the past, the fact that we love each other in a respectful, secure and profoundly healthy way is truly my biggest blessing and I wake up every day so happy and grateful for him. He is an incredible man with so much drive, intelligence, kindness, and gifts to give the world.

About a year and a half ago it came up for the first time that we saw ourselves getting married one day. It was such a beautiful moment and it rocked my world to have been vulnerable, said those words, and have him say them too. Since then it’s been something incredibly happy that I get to hold in my heart and look forward to. The subject has come up sporadically since then but I haven’t wanted to push it too far since we are young and it is very much an “eventually” thing. Both of our parents are divorced and his come from money. He got a lot of strong advice growing up not to marry young and to protect his assets, to see it from a more financial view than I ever have thought of it. 

Nevertheless the thought makes me happy and we often daydream about the future we’ll build together: the little house in New Hampshire we hope to buy and the dogs and chickens we’ll have. These are conversations he participates in and brings up on his own all the time. I want to be able to talk casually about the marriage aspect, too - go to bed with a sleepy “can’t wait to marry you” or “love of my life” - but for some reason recently whenever the subject has come up he’s clammed up and made it feel really serious. This culminated maybe two months ago with a really weird conversation in which I sensed he might not have processed what marriage really means to him in the way that I had, and that he wasn’t ready to be talking about this in the way that I was or as much as he had let on. I told him I don’t want to put a gun to his head, this is just something that makes me happy to think about and talk about, and I tell him everything. I said I love him for him; I’d wait as long as he needs; but that I firmly didn’t want to bring up the subject again until he was comfortable discussing it. I wanted to relieve the pressure on him, and I haven’t mentioned it since. 

Well, yesterday we spent a really lovely day getting lunch and hiking with my family. They live far away so we don’t see them very often. My stepsister and her fiancé were there as well, and of course there was a little bit of light conversation about their upcoming wedding. My bf was his usual friendly, easygoing self. I noticed he seemed quiet on the way home and later that evening so I asked if he was worried about work but he just said he was tired from a long day traveling. I made him a drink, kissed him on the forehead like I always do and promised we could do whatever he wanted to relax that night. Just did what I normally do when I can tell he’s stressed, try to show empathy and take care of him. 

But then as I’m making dinner he comes over to me and drops this bomb. He came over to me crying and said spending time with an engaged couple and even barely talking about their wedding had sent him into a panic and he didn’t know if he could ever see himself getting married. I was completely blindsided. I tried to parse what he was saying but it was like my brain was stuck. Evidently he had been locking himself in his office at work all week crying about this. I kept asking him why he would say he wanted to marry me if he didn’t. He said he was lying, basically. That he wanted to give me what he knew I wanted to make me happy. I could only just stare at him open mouthed. I kept trying to pinpoint if he was saying to me, “I don’t think I’ll be ready to get married for a long time” or “I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to get married” and I really don’t think he knows himself. I don’t think he has processed marriage at all and this is the first time it’s hitting him. He kept saying stuff about not knowing where his career will lead or if he’ll have money (he has a great job, an outstanding network, and is definitely not poor. Neither of us are) and I was just like. We’re a partnership. You wanted to be with me yesterday, you want to be with me today, do you want to be with me tomorrow? Yes, he said. I said well that’s all what matters, we have a life we love and we’ll take on the future together one day. 

I’m devastated. He left for his stepmother’s house and I don’t know when he’ll be home. I can not take another sleeping pill or my heart will stop but I can’t sleep a wink. I literally spiked a 100 degree fever and spent all night sweating and freezing. I had no idea it was possible to be in so much pain it makes you physically sick. This person is the bedrock of my life. We have ALWAYS had rock solid confidence that we can trust each other, be vulnerable around each other, and be our full authentic selves without inhibition or fear of judgment We share everything together and we are best friends. He even said that over and over as he sobbed and told me he loved me and that he didn’t want to get married. Hours ago I had the most beautiful and solid relationship in the world. Now I don’t know if we’re going to break up. I’m reeling. I feel like I’ve been stabbed in the back by my safe space. The earth fell out from under me and I don’t even know what to think any more. 

What do I even do or say to save this? Was I too strong in voicing my desire to get married that I scared him off? Has anyone else gone through something similar?

TLDR; my boyfriend of five years held in all his fears about marriage and commitment and they all exploded out at once, and now our amazing and healthy relationship could completely sink out of nowhere.",1666012022.0,bathdub-mermaid,relationships
I(22F) am doubting if my relationship with bf (22M) if it's healthy or not. Any advice?,"I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) work in the same office. 

Recently his set of friends joined our company and ever since then we haven't been spending a lot of time. 
And even if we do, it's just us fighting. 

It's been around 8 months in our relationship and there have been endless fights regarding the same topics. 

1. He doesn't communicate to me if he gets hurt by me. I have to practically beg him for him to open up. 
2. Ever since his friends showed up he's only wants to spend time in a group and not alone with me. 
3. He doesn't plan dates. I have to ask him if he can take me somewhere or if we can go somewhere. 
4. He doesn't put boundaries on some other woman touching him. Not inappropriately. This happens in the office space. But doesn't want me to even hold his finger in secret when no one's even looking. And doesn't want to do it in the office space. Also he tells me if he sets any boundaries, he might lose the sister bond with his other friend. 
5. He prioritises his friends more. When he wants to go out with his friends. He asks me permission but doesn't ask me what my plans are. He'll somehow convince me if I say no or would act/text me in a sad tone. And when he has to leave, he leaves in the middle of the conversation without even acknowledging what I've replied.  
6. I'm very sensitive and I cry if I'm hurt. But he doesn't empathise with me. If I cry because of his fight he immediately gets upset. And If I cry in the office he asks me to go to the restroom, asks me not to cry and ""Why are you crying now?"" Sort of questions. 
Although he does help me calm down if we're alone. 

Apart from all these, he stays loyal to me, takes care of me very well. He puts in effort if I'm feeling down on my own. And he has very good plans for the both of us and sees a future with me. 

I've mentioned all of these issues repeatedly but I see no change. 

I've told him that it's not immediate change that I seek right now. All I ask is some effort. Some sort of immediate realisation after he's done something. But he says that that's how he grew up and needs more time to change. 

I'm sure that most of what is here is a negative pov on this. But I don't feel like he's gonna change and this is going to repeat again and again and its breaking my trust in him. 

Is this something that I could wait and need to help him to work it out. I feel the need to leave the relationship everytime something like this repeats. I am soothed when we fight and then he apologises.  This keeps repeating. 

Would really appreciate some advice on this.

Bf says he'll change some negative habits but doesn't seem to put in an effort. ",1727534729.0,DokieRex,relationships
GF (24F) is giving me (24M) a hard time because 3 of my exes are/were overweight,"My girlfriend and I have been dating about 8 months. We have talked about past relationships a bit but not extensively. A few nights ago, I'm not sure how but we were on the subject and I ended up on Facebook showing a few pictures of the girls I have been with.


In the second half of high school, I spent 1.5 years dating a girl, we'll call her Girl 1. Girl 1 was a tad bulkier, not obese, not fat, just slightly larger. I am a pretty standard build and average weight for a guy. Her being a bit bigger than me was not remotely an issue, I thought she was beautiful and we had a strong connection and relationship. We never had true sex and didn't get extremely far in that department because we were both beginners. We broke up a bit before graduating. She has lost a lot of weight in her modern pictures and is now average-ish, but there are still pictures deep in her profile with me from back then.


My sophomore year of college, I had a FWB/series of hookups over a few months with Girl 2, who was a bit more overweight than Girl 1 but still not too much. We were in the same friend group and got drunk and hooked up one night, then kept that going for a few months. She was not what I would consider relationship material for myself, not because of her size, but she just had a different personality and lifestyle that fit more into a friend status, plus she was two years older than me. That ended when she graduated. She looks the same in her pictures.


Girl 3 was a random two-time hookup also in my sophomore year of college. Didn't go anywhere so I wouldn't really even call her an ex or anything. She was not overweight at the time but has since gained a fair amount. I'm not trying to fat shame or anything. 

There have been a few other ladies I have dated/been with before my current GF that are generally standard and would not be considered overweight or anything. There was nothing sexually attractive about being with these 3 girls who were specifically larger than me; it just was what it was. I never felt embarrassed to be with them either, I thought they were all great and I got what I was looking for at the time from being with them. 


While my GF and I were casually browsing these pictures of the girls, she didn't say too much, but after we were done, she started making a few comments about me liking fat girls and all that. I said it wasn't about that and that was kind of mean of her to say. She dropped it then but has since made a few other comments. For example, the other night I recommended something for dinner that wasn't super healthy and she asked if I was trying to fatten her up and if I would like her better like that. She is average sized but has in the past expressed concerns about her own weight, so I'm not sure if she's just being insecure and is worried that I only like her because she's fat (she's not though), or if she's trying to like kink shame me (even though it wasn't about that) or what. I have never felt bad about being with these girls in the past but now am feeling embarrassed like I was doing something wrong, creating an uncomfortable situation. What can I do here to either alleviate her concerns about her own weight or get her to not make hurtful comments about the people I have been with in the past?

My (29F) step daughter (18F) wants to give the present I bought my other step daughter (15F) and take all the credit.,"Alright so I married my husband (37M) about 6 months ago. He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years.

They got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her.

After Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her.

We didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it. 

We dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted.

Then I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now.

I am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this? 

Tldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it.

UPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said ""We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior."" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life. I know it's a tough road to navigate, but I really appreciate brutal honesty, and advice. ",1544889743.0,pizza12355uqu,relationships
"My best friend (19M) and I (19F) want to stay friends after having feelings for each other but came to the conclusion we wouldn't work well in a relationship, how do we cope/ maintain a healthy friendship?","Backstory:
Nothing has ever happened between us, nothing sexual or intimate. We both liked each other for a few months and never knew (we had the same class) and I started dating my ex boyfriend and apparently he got upset and backed away, but we became close after my relationship ended. 

last summer he told me he had feelings for me and I told him it was mutual, I told him l'd be open to dating and he said he'd think about it. (He did for a month) he made excuses that he wouldn't have time. He doesn't want anything sexual if it isn't a serious relationship which is understandable. 

Fast forward a year later, We both still like each other and we talked recently, he said he would try to make it work if he had the time (he's avoidant attachment and l'm anxious attachment so we'd have a lot of work to do lol) But we still hang out almost every day and we have intimate moments of eye contact/convos that I can't shake. I definitely don't wanna lose him as a friend but I don't always want to feel on the brink. 

Any advice on how to get over him without losing him?

I (f32) kind of want my boyfriend (m35) to be my dad,"Just the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him.

Some background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.

I've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.

The more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.

To be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him ""I wish I'd had a dad like you"" and he said ""I wish you did too."" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.

It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.

TL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?

EDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him.

"My partner and me (M21 and F20) have been in a very happy, loving, healthy relationship but recently he has been talking a lot about his ex-crush. Should I be worried?
","Me (F20) and my partner M(21) have been together a good 6 months. He identifies as bisexual, but has never dated a man. He has liked a man before, which was one of his bestest friend apparently according to the way he described him. He was genuinely like a best friend and a brother(let's name him A), and also someone who loved him romantically a lot and my partner loved him too , however he did not know it was in a romantic way back then. Now every now and then if I mention something that relates to A , my partner will never stop talking about him. I respect it, sure , as they used to be great friends but now they don't talk but it always feels like he is still in love with A, which bothers me a little but I am too scared to bring it up to him.

For example, today after a long time of not mentioning A to my partner, I told him about how I left him a message on the 'unsent project' website. Now, I expected him to try and look for the message I left HIM , however he searched for his name and found a message that read 'you made me feel loved and now you're gone' which according to him was DEFINITELY written by A, because apparently that was the last thing A said to my partner before they stopped talking(over 4 years ago). I know this is a very silly example and something tiny but I was a little thrown back because he had 0 interest in looking for something his current partner (me) left instead he kept going on and on about how it is such a big thing to come across a message left by A and how he should have never went on that website.

I don't know if I should be feeling upset about something as such.  Help?

She's mature, sophisticated, smart, and beautiful, and im physically, emotionally, and psychologically attracted to her, but in the quite spaces we share, and alone, a voice that's earned my trust tells me something is wrong, but im not sure why I should act on it, or what it is saying exactly, and it's been a year, and i haven't been able to assuage it. and it starting effect what we share.

we met volunteering, and she having left her marriage only a year before then. she didn't have aspirations of having a serious relationship so soon, and i didn't either. We talked about it upfront: my aspirations to move and travel and return to school, and hers to find peace and happiness, if that was with someone or not. So, like a couple of lusty and sexually and romantically desiccated idiots we started falling into each other. Perhaps unwise of us.

I can't tell why part of me is having an issue committing to our relationship, discovering love together, and figuring out how to accomplish our independent goals as couple,and contend with the unforeseen unknowns of the world as unit.

She's expressed a desire to move and travel, and doesn't seem to mind my desire to return to school. I've never rejected the idea of traveling with a romantic partner either, infact, i would put travel on hold for love, so long as it came eventually, which i think is how i got here... and yet there is something i feel I can't reconcile, and it doesn't feel like fear. it feels like loss. it feels almost profane to love what we have. I don't have a sensation of ""things are too good so this must end"", more like ""will i regret loving this love as we age differently."" ""how would i live with myself if the answered turned out to be yes? and will i be in love with her when I have that realization? will it be because of age related health decline? will i resent her for that?"" ""will my role eventually become caretaker in our relationship?"" ""will i regret not discovering/living life with someone nearer my age?"".

These feelings contrast starkly with the reality we share today: a deeply endearing, simple, satisfying, respectful, hot, and compassionate romance. I feel like i'm going nowhere fast..

What does a healthy relationship look like when you’re young (f23 m24),"My boyfriend (m24) and I (f23) have been together for 4 years, most of which long distance. Now that I just wrapped up grad school im dealing with post grad blues because I’m scared and frustrated by all of the instability and unanswered questions I’m faced with. What will be my next career step (after I leave my current position)? Do I want another degree? Where do I want to live next? When will we end long distance? It doesn’t help that my bf is faced with financially instability rn and is also struggling with deciding what will be his next degree/career move. Other than the uncertainty, we have a good relationship but I really want to investigate what it means to have a healthy relationship that serves you so I can determine if I want to stay or leave. I think our age is important to consider because neither of us have been in long term relationships before this so of course we love each other very much but we don’t know what it means to commit nor have we had any trials or circumstances aside from long distance to test us. When I look up generally what it means to be in a healthy relationship or when to know to leave, I don’t feel like the advice I see reflects where we currently are in life. We literally just don’t have enough experience to know. It’s not like he’s emotionally abusive, intentionally not making money (we’re recent grads in a recession) or is making me feel abandoned. Does that make sense?

I 25F can't have sex in a mentally healthy way but sex is something my boyfriend 34M can't leave out of a relationship,"I am 25F and in a relationship with my boyfriend who I've known since 12/2023 and been with since this past February, so to me it's still an early relationship. However, this is the first relationship of mine where I'm actually want to commit and not just fuck around (not sexually, I mean just remain mentally uncommitted/staying in a situationship even though I know the two of us aren't going anywhere real). So when I feel conflicted with something in the relationship, I'm wanting to address it/work through it, rather than ignore it and let it stay as something that I eventually end things with someone over.

TL;DR I have a difficult relationship with sex to where I don't want to have it atm and also for the forseeable future cause I always feel bad afterwards (for many different reasons), even though I am in an otherwise healthy/exclusive relationship. Anyone have a similar story, or + experiences with sex therapy?

Since I have this very attached belief that sex just leads to the demise of a relationship\*, I am able to more freely engage in it with someone i don't know well/don't care for as much (in terms of having a lasting relationship), rather than someone who I actually want things to work out with. I think this is the primary belief that is currently causing my conflict. I've basically shared all my thoughts on sex with him, he tries to understand but he doesn't share the same lived experience so I definitely can see it's hard for him to relate. 

Initially, a few months ago, he said he would try to abstain with me. But I think he did some honest thinking and came to the conclusion that for him, it's not something he can leave out in a relationship because it helps him feel more secure/loved in the relationship. 

Since sex has already been a very regular part of our lives, since early when we met, it's very hard to transition to something else. But that doesn't even really matter, now knowing it's not something he is willing to leave out. 

My guy is objectively a great lover. He puts it down :p but also is able to stay pretty present in the moment and ask me how I'm feeling. He is reciprocal, tender, not always so explicit, encouraging, patient, and objectively I only see positives in the bedroom (from his side at least lol). I can tell that he wants to show me how it feels for him, and hopefully help me those positives too. 

\~ and now for the part about me n my bullshit \~

About the asterik sentence earlier: I think this belief stems from different reasons:

1) I was very much in hookup culture for a few years and I think that being my first exposure into sex was just fucking detrimental to my sense of value as a woman. Before I knew how to express or let alone think about/consider my own sense of comfort/boundaries, I knew how to use my body. I think this is my biggest fear that really scares me from doing it even in a healthy relationship, b/c every time I do it, I feel like I'm just proving this point right.

2) I was raised Christian but was exposed to very explicit porn at a way too yong age (7) and always harbored this confusion/guilt about how I'd be watching gay or daddy daughter or cnc porn right before youth group lol with 0 people to talk to about it. Before getting into this relationship, I hadn't not been talking to a guy since I first started (18), and I was like holy shit. I need some fucking time alone! I was on/off this celibacy thing for a few months before meeting my bf, motivated by religious reasons but far more so from my own personal experience that just told me casual hooking up, or the hookup --> situationship pipline was such a waste of time I didn't wanna touch ever again. 

3) My parents are the least affectionate people everrrr (cultural, but also personal), they don't hug, kiss, anything. Which I jus accepted as normal. I think what affects me more is that there was no teaching (outright or implied) about what it means to be a woman in this world, what it means to respect yourself and your phsyical/emotional boundaries. It was just assumed I wouldn't do anything of the sort until marriage I guess. 

4) My bf is the most emotionally mature guy I've met, ever. But we also have some major disagreements in what I think are important values/priorities. I have this strong belief that sex (especially if good/""compatible"") tends to make ppl settle in reltionships, and sacrifice on other things they at one point found important in a potential partner, so I'm definitely scared we're doing that. And like letting the physical aspect blind me (and him) for a while. 

About therapy: I started going to therpay in 2020 and have been with the same one since then, I really like her. I thought about seeing a sex therapist, my bf brought it up, but from what I see in other sex therapist's posts, their areas of expertise tend to revolve more around timidness / nervousness while being with a partner, Premature ejaculation, incompatible expectations between partner, Coping with STDs,Not able to orgasm. IDK WHAT TO DO! Part of me feels I need some time alone/being celibate to heal, and that it's not fair to stay with my bf like this. But part of me/he is also hopeful that I can heal within this relationship.....please help yall

Outgrowing my husband (27),"We’ve been high school sweethearts, did long distance, moved out, pets, got married, bought a house, the whole shindig. There was a time i was madly in love with this guy and couldn’t think how id be otherwise. 

Well during covid my husband found out he has “curly” hair. Its actually a ball of matted fluff with some wave to it, but sure it was news to us so we grew it out, tried curly products and all that, i encouraged it. But now its this greasy mop that sits atop his head. Mind you his hygiene is rough too. We recently had to have a talk about showering more than once a week, which he complied with for about that week. I along with his family and my mom have gently told him it looks horrid (think cynthia from rugrats or rick from rick and morty) and to consider at least a trim. It honestly smells bad too and it pisses me off every time it gets on me. Now he has me putting clips in it so i have to rummage through the grease to pull it out of his face. 

The last few months ive become less and less attracted to him and started noticing other things that i cant seem to unnotice that has always been there but now i cant get past it like before. Like his nasty ass grown out toe nails with gunk under it (its apparently my duty to cut it? Hes waiting on me to trim his toes) or that he’s been dieting to loose weight and now he looks like a fragile sick man (he’s healthy but loves the frail look). Atop all the physical stuff, theres the usual “mental” stuff like wont initiate or plan dates and taking him anywhere means dragging him or giving him a pep talk before hand to not ruin my day, needs to be told everything that needs to get done around the house, wont listen when i approach him with these things or will work on it for about a day or a few and revert back. 

I get that it’s pretty dramatic but it’s not just the hair. I do think it led me to being grossed out enough to take a step back to assess the situation. 

Now it feels like i’m older and know what i want in a man which is a spontaneous, high energy, social butterfly, healthy, gym loving dude type but i went with the complete opposite because i was young and in love and he’s genuinely a good dude, just not what i want in a man at this phase in life anymore. On a day to day I keep it calm and mellow and try to get through it without loosing my cool but some days I just cant stand looking at that hair and everything else that comes with it and it pisses me off. Im sure to him it seems like I’m bipolar or mad at nothing but it feels like im mad at everything all at once if the wind blows wrong. 

Is this normal? Ive been exposed to couples that stay together but seem like they just gotten worn down from each other my whole life, i don’t want that. Is there any way to fix it since talking to him doesn’t work? He’s a great dude in many departments, better than most, but at the very least i just want him to just grow up and show his full potential. I get that the hair makes him happy but cmon.. it’s not just about the hair. 

TL;DR: 12 years into a relationship and realizing that I may be out growing my husband. Hygiene is what made me take a step back to see all the other issues. At this point in my life I crave a guy with different qualities and am wondering how to make things work out. 

Edit: hi! Lots of traction here.. lots to think about too. I guess my main question here is: How do I communicate these issues with someone who is very set on their ways and not the best at receiving feedback? ",1720614451.0,parrotmomforlife,relationships

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0l1n/update_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/)

You wonderful motherfuckers. Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to /r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha. 

I got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of **Alexis.** Not women in general.

I got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish. 

A clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a ""hey, guess who dropped by"" situation.

Anyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there.

In the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there ""not even Brooke."" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes. 

I got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with ""Dude, what the fuck."" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious.  In his words: ""I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some."" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever.  Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything.  Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom ""Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then."" Imagining that moment was kind of funny.  Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously.  During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.  

When we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in.  I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate.  He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over. 

This week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute.  As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying ""Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution.""  I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it. 

Later that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to.  She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day.  She said she felt guilty that she ""led him on"" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???)  She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (""not rape, but..idk I never said yes either"") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on.  She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to ""make it right"" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by:

* Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again

* Give me full access to her phone and passwords.  She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times.

* Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?) 

* Makeup sex whenever I wanted

Yeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer.  I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from ""our song"") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying ""She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL"" 

In happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said ""First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it."" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful. 

As for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it. 

So that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with.  Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them. 

Again, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support. 

I fucking love you guys.

Struggling with Intense Jealousy in My Healthy Relationship. What do I do?,"I'm a 20 year old female dating a 20 year old male. We've been dating for a quite long time now and we've managed to get through a lot of issues together. We are extremely committed to each other and hopefully I do marry this man. I have a problem. Recently, I've been so so jealous of him. I am a single child born in a terrible family where my parents despise each other. I have no one at home, no one to love, no one that listens to me, no safety or comfort or support. Additionally, I also do not have good friends. And it's hard because how the fuck do 20 year old adults make friends? All the friends I had were horrible people and I only have acquaintances. No one that genuinely cares or supports either. All in all, I'm incredibly alone. I only have my boyfriend (who I'm eternally grateful for) I suffer from depression and anxiety (who the fuck doesn't atp) And the only person I have is my boyfriend. On the other end, my boyfriend is incredibly lucky to be born into a healthy functioning family. His parents love each other, he has a sibling, and a really cute dog. They travel together, eat lunch together (all these simple things I've never experienced in my life and I never will). He also has a friend group that is incredibly sweet, cool and supportive and they've been friends for years. It is obvious that I need him more than he needs me. Trust me, he does provide me with love, affection and support but he will never understand how I feel every single day of my life. And sometimes I get so fucking jealous of him because the days we don't hang out, he is still out there living and existing and me on the other hand, I stay in bed morning to night. I work remote, I go to the gym. That is it. That's my life. I live in a very quite (i'm serious no one says a word) and a depressing house. I have nothing else to my life and it's incredibly lonely. A lot of the days I have massive breakdowns because he has everything I've ever wanted and I always feel inferior and alone compared to him. Whenever he calls me when I'm home, there's always a friend or a family talking in the background. He's always with someone he likes spending time with. He sounds happy. And I'm in my depressing ass house. Every single time. It makes me feel so fucking miserable.
And none of this is his fault. He makes it known that he's always going to be there for me, but I can not stop envying his life and the people he has for him. What do I do? Because my life isn't going to get any better because I can't afford to move out just yet. I feel like I'm destined to be alone. And I feel like part of me has started pushing him away because of the things he has that I never will. God forbid, if we ever break up he will still have people in his life and I will be the one that's entirely alone. I'm not sure what to do because I'm aware that this is such a toxic feeling to bring into a healthy relationship.


TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old female dating a 19-year-old male, and we've been committed for a long time. Despite his loving support, I struggle with intense jealousy due to my lonely, dysfunctional family and lack of close friends. My boyfriend has a supportive family and a great friend group, which makes me feel inferior and more dependent on him. 
I'm battling depression and anxiety, and my envy is harming our relationship. I don't know how to cope with these feelings, especially since I can't afford to move out and improve my situation. What should I do?",1720614978.0,OddError971,relationships
Is it a lack of emotional connection or my first healthy relationship?,"
I (19f) met my current boyfriend (21m) three years ago and we’ve been dating for almost one year. When we were friends, our chemistry was so powerful. We would stay up for hours talking. I felt like I had found my person. As the relationship settled in this started to fade and now as life picks up for the both of us, it’s starting to weigh on me. 

My past relationships haven’t been the healthiest and I’m used to the whole arguing & making up cycle. My last relationship specifically was very toxic. We would argue and spill out everything we had to say to each other, and then did the same when we made up. This in return, made me feel closer to the person. 

My current boyfriend and I have never had a fight to the extent that I’ve had in the past (thank god) but I don’t feel emotionally connected to him. 

For reference, I’m very “in-tune” with my emotions and I speak everything on my mind. In return, I expect my partner to do the same. This does not go for just arguments. This is the way I communicate with my friends, family, etc.

My boyfriend lacks in this department. Whenever I speak of a random subject or go into deep, thought provoking subjects, I get very short or uninterested answers & counterparts. This resorts to me speaking to my best friend about my weird inner most thoughts and ideas. I talk to my best friend about everything and she’s the first person I text when I have something to say. If I do this with my boyfriend, I don’t get the same interested responses as I do with her.

When problems arise, I’m the one that brings them to attention. He then gets defensive and puts his walls up because he feels like he’s being attacked. I’ve worked on this that way I don’t come off as intense, but in my defense I’m just trying to talk things out- not argue or start a fight. If he has a problem, I have to sense it and bring it up. Sometimes this makes me feel like a toxic partner since he never has anything to say. Am I the one with the problems? I don’t know. 

We see each other around 3 days a week and will sleep at each other’s places. When we’re apart, talking/texting is minimal (which I’m also not used to). I feel secure in the relationship and so does he so I guess there’s not a need to text all the time. I just see my friend and her partner constantly texting about random subjects and it sometimes makes me question my relationship dynamic. All of this results in the relationship feeling “dull” on my side. I don’t know if we just need to find the spark again like how we did in the beginning or if this will never resolve. As far as I’m aware, he’s completely happy and satisfied with our relationship. 

Also not to mention that he will soon have to travel for his career, making us destined for a long distance relationship. This is why I’m concerned about the texting. 

I have brought up everything I’ve mentioned in this post, yet when I bring up anything that’s remotely “emotional” it doesn’t get very far.

TLDR; I don’t have the emotional connection that I expected to have with my boyfriend but I’m confused on if this is a compatibility problem or from my toxic relationship history. ",1723445551.0,cykxp,relationships
I (24f) have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend (26m) except I don’t get the one thing I need,"We’ve been dating for 1.5 year. It’s been a great relationship and we’ve fought tooth and nail for our relationship to work. We communicate well, we tell each other what we need from each other and I feel like I can be myself with him. I got some serious therapy around the time we started dating, which helped a lot with my fear of being in a relationship. I very much love him. But there’s one reoccurring problem I keep running into. I am an extremely affectionate person. Verbally and physically. I love being told that I’m attractive, dirty talking and a lot of hugging and kissing. My boyfriend is not like that at all. I may hug and kiss him but he’ll push me away a bit or doesn’t want to kiss or hug for much long. I’ve told him a lot of times that that’s what I need out of the relationship. And he’ll either get upset and say it’s too much and it’s not who he is or he’ll try. And through the 1.5 year, he’s definitely gotten better. But personally, I haven’t felt like it was enough, because he still pushes me away. It’s also made it hard for me to look forward to having sex with him. Because there’s no form of anticipation. Recently, I traveled out the country to meet family in the Caribbean for the first time. And EVERYONE was like that. And I never felt so loved and appreciated. There was a guy there who is the son of a very close family friend and we both noticed that we were attracted to each other. I made it very clear that I was in a relationship and we lived in different countries, so it wouldn’t be right and he was very respectful and respected my boundary. But it made me think about my relationship and how if I can meet an entire island of people like this, then my boyfriend can do it. I went back home and on NYD, I spoke with my boyfriend crying and said that I need physical and verbal affection or I cannot stay with him. He said he will work on it and he came over later. I can see that he wanted to have sex later but I just couldn’t work my way up to wanting to. He was definitely very affectionate last night and it was exactly what I wanted but I just felt so sad that it had to get to this point and that I didn’t want to have sex with him. I’m not sure what to do at this point and I don’t have a lot of people with healthy relationships around to give good advice.

Tl;Dr boyfriend and I been together for 1.5 years but he is not affectionate. I need a lot of affection. I went to a foreign country where everyone is affectionate and it made me think about my relationship and how much I’m missing out. How to I work around this?",1704228841.0,Busybee_unbusybody,relationships
I (31M) was just told by my partner (29F) that she wants to stop working fulltime.,"First let me start off by saying my partner has been through a lot. We had been dating for 2 years and planning a life together when she was disagnosed with cancer. At the time she was in school for a dual graduate degree program and managed to finish it. Treatment was rough on her and she strugled a lot through it, and hasn't done well mentally dealing with the unfairness of it all, how different her body is after surgeries, and the fear of it coming back. All perfectly understandable, and I've been as supportive as I can throughout it all.

Now all that said, she went into the graduate programs after we started dating and one of the degrees was at a very expensive school for something that was only related and not required for the work she planned on doing which would never pay very well. I questioned her about it gently at the time but she was adamant about getting the expensive degree. It was her life, and we agreed it would be fine because we could utilize public service loan forgiveness to pay off her debt that would total \~$100k. This was before cancer.

I earn a considerable amount more than her, when we started dating I made \~4x and even with her degrees I make \~3x what she does. I've always been happy to spend money on her, and after having moved in together over a year ago and proposing shortly after I really went into the mindset of it being ""our"" money. When we moved in she was finishing her degrees and I covered 100% of our bills, including some tuition costs for an extra semester since she was slightly delayed by her treatment. This was totally fine because school was her job and she'd be able to contribute when she graduated and even though I make much more if we are both working full time jobs it felt fair.

Now that she has graduated and started working, she is miserable at her job mostly because she is incredibly anxious that she isn't doing it well and doesn't feel like her school prepared her. She was already prone towards anxiety and depression (she takes medicine for it) but mentally she is in a very bad spot because of all this. On top of that she feels like she doesn't doing enough for her health (mostly exercise) to keep her healthy to reduce the cancer from coming back but she says she is too tired after work to do much else than occationally go on a walk.

Recently she got the idea in her head to start working half weeks to give her more time to exercise, and stress her out about work less. She says not knowing for sure how long she'll live has changed her priorities about working. Before all this she was a pretty driven type a personality working multiple jobs. But working part time doesn't meet the requirements for public service loan forgiveness.

We've talked about it extensively and she feels it is important for her to work part time, but I am not very comfortable with the idea for many reasons. I get where she is coming from in her needs but feel like she is looking for a quick fix to her problems that puts us in a pretty big hole financially because she is so miserable instead of fully dealing with her problems. I'd be more ok with it if it was short term while she sorted through some things but she says she just wants more time to exercise and be stress free so she doesn't know when that would end.

I just feel like she is taking our relationship which is already unbalanced and asking to make it a lot more so--and soley because she is in a position to do so because of my job. We can financially afford it but I haven't been able to come to terms about the disproportionality it would create in our relationship.

I am just looking for some advice on maybe a better way to think about this that would maybe make me feel more comfortable with it, some opinions on if I'm just being a greedy/selfish asshole, and some comiseration if anyone has been in a similar situation.

I probably left out a lot so feel free to ask questions, this post is already very long, and if you read it all thanks for sticking with me! I obviously shared my side but I tried to not be too uneven since I think she has legitimate points but it hasn't changed my uneasiness with it.

Healthy relationship making me feel uncomfortable,"I feel like I have been in and out of extreme relationships all my life. I am F 29 and would say I have been into 3 serious relationships prior to my current relationship. We have been going out for around 7 months. 
All my relationships prior to this was such an extreme emotional roller coaster. I feel like I had a part to play as well since I was using my relationships as a tool to run away from my life. I haven’t understood why yet but after 2 years of therapy, self reflections, meditation and some financial stability, I am in a good space where I can spend time with myself. 
I am in a very stable loving relationship with a lovely guy. He says less but shows his love through actions. He doesn’t make me question anything. I know he is there for me, doesn’t react extremely to my asks/wants/differences and mistakes too. 
We have recently started talking about taking things to next level by meeting each others parents. And the conversation was such a pleasant no bs stuff. Everything we talk about it is from a practical perspective since it’s almost given for him that he wants to be with me. I, on the other hand, am freaking out because there’s no big gestures. I don’t doubt him/his intentions. I really want to be with him since I love how our relationship is, how we spend our time together, how we love each other’s company.

My husband and I have had long talks over the years about what we saw growing up and neither of us want that type of relationship with each other or our kids. We both seen how it still affects our siblings and that’s not something either of us wants. 

These last 3 years, and honestly probably longer have been extremely stressful and it’s been difficult to feel at least for me like we’re growing together. We’ve both hurt each other in different ways and new things have come to light and it’s hard to unsee patterns not to feel emotionally disconnected at the moment. 

I’m not necessarily looking for advice, I understand everyone is different with different experiences that influence our own personal boundaries and so each couple is different and life isn’t so cut and dry and as humans we make mistakes. 

 Just could us some more perspective on what are realistic healthy boundaries in monogamous long term relationships and what are good habits of healthy relationships. How does one heal when their boundaries are broken or respected? 

TDLR: Didn’t have good examples of what healthy relationships look like growing up. And am curious what most monogamous couples consider healthy boundaries or what simple habits help relationship last through the hard times. ",1719909428.0,SnowNinS,relationships
[Update] My best friend is cheating on his wife,"
Link to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vaUuBhkOwI

First off thank you everyone for your advice. I think i was still kind of in a mode of shock and panic and reading your comments helped me sober up. I appreciate you all. 

I’d also like to quickly address those of you who suggested burying it because “I have no ties to this woman” or “he’s your friend not her” or “bros before hoes”. This isn’t some random girl he just started hanging out with. They’ve been married for 7 years and were dating for 2 before that. She’s been a big part of our lives for nearly a decade and is my friend in her own right, even if she doesn’t share the same history me and her husband do. So the idea that I have no ties to her or owe her nothing is just wrong. 

The evening after posting this I told my wife. You all were right that I shouldn't have kept it from her in the first place. She listened to what happened and then sat silent for a minute. I was afraid she was going to be mad at me for not telling her like a lot of you said, but no. She said that a part of her was relieved because she could tell that something had been severely bothering me these past couple of days, but aside from offering the occasional ""are you ok?"" she decided that I would tell her when I was ready to share. Though, when I told her about the thread, she was slightly annoyed and thought it was silly for me to have brought my problem to a bunch of strangers on the internet before I brought it to her. I apologized for not telling her sooner and for waiting to act despite knowing in my heart what I needed to do. My wonderful, amazing, and astoundingly understanding wife responded with, ""even when we're sure what is right, it's only human to hesitate when we know it's going to cost us dearly."" 
That said, she and I are all good.

After our discussion, I showed her the thread. She read comments for nearly an hour before we started talking again. Ultimately we decided that we had to tell my friend's wife (who I will from here on refer to as Sister so I don't keep having to say friend's wife). The reason we did this instead of an ultimatum is my wife was concerned he would use the time to cover his tracks or orchestrate her opinion against us. Neither of us really felt that would be in character for him, but we wouldn’t have thought it in character for him to cheat either. My wife texted Sister and asked if she could come over after work the next day (Sister works mostly evenings so she usually gets off around 11.)  My wife had told her it was a serious conversation so Sister was pretty tense when she arrived at our house. We sat her down and we told her everything. After hearing it, she took a long breath and said, ""I've known for a couple of weeks."" Apparently, she had asked her boss if she could go home early one night a few weeks ago because she wasn't feeling well, and found he wasn't home. She texted him asking what he was up to and he said he was ""at home watching tv."" She tried to look up his location on their tracking app but it was turned off. She left home and waited until when her shift would normally end to return. He was home when she got there and when she asked how his evening was or if he did anything interesting, he told her hed been home all evening watching tv and playing video games. She checked the app again and sure enough, his location was turned back on. Sister said that, until we told her, she didn't have any proof but felt she knew what must have been happening. We asked her what she was planning to do now that she knew.

Here's the part I didn't see coming: she plans to move forward with IVF. According to her, it's always been her lifelong dream to be a mother and without IVF it will never happen. IVF is expensive. She won't be able to afford it on her own and she's afraid that if she leaves her husband she'll never get another chance. Her current plan is to follow through with implantation and decide what will happen to her marriage afterward. She says they have a healthy embryo and she wants to give her child a chance, even if it means she could end up raising the child on her own. When I asked if threre was any way she could see them reconciling when this is all over, she said it depended on him. In the end, she asked us to please keep it quiet and not tell him that she knows. We agreed and assured her we'd be there for her if she needed anything. I called my friend the next day and told him that, while I still love him, I need space after learning what he did and that we wouldn't be seeing each other for a while. 

I still feel a lot of things: relief from not bearing the secret, sorrow for sister and what I fear she's going to have to go through, anger at my friend for destroying our family as it has been (if not destroying it entirely), and grief from what feels like the loss of the person who has been with me my whole life. I hope for all 3 of their sakes they can work it out, but I know those chances are slim. This whole thing has been exhausting and, while I’m not sure exactly how to move on from it, now I can at least try. 

Thank you all again for your help. I doubt I’ll have any more updates

First healthy relationship,"Hiii everyone!! So I (19F) and my bf (20M) have been together for over 7 months. I just need some advice. 

I have GAD which hasn’t been severe. I went to therapy a few times. I get episodes once every few years. My relationship life has not been great. I had lots of toxic ex’s who belittled me. Made me believe in stuff, manipulated me, etc. my boyfriend and I met a year ago, we’re talking, he was going out with his ex so I left, and then we started being friends again and after 6 months started dating. 

Besides the past, he is everything I ever wanted. He’s caring, charming, smart, and rational. He changed all the issues he needed too because he wanted to be with me.  But we went thru a hard time and I’ve been filled with anxiety for a month. I really really really want this to be the one. I know im young but I want it to be him. I’m just scared. How do I not be so scared? My heads always in the future and I want to enjoy what I have. He’s understanding of me but he also wants me to feel better. I won’t lie my self esteem dropped significantly, personal reasons. Does that have anything to do with him? This is my first healthy relationship and I genuinely want it to last. Also people are like “well ur young so it’ll never last” giving me more anxiety. Also I barely feel butterflies. I feel calm when I see him. And my body is like AHHH WHY DONT YOU FEEL BUTTERFLIES.  Anything helps. Thanks.
 I feel like a noob 

TL;DR: after so many bad relationships I’m finally in a healthy one. I’ve been getting anxiety. Is it normal? How do I live in the present and stop worrying about the future? Is it normal to feel calm? ",1719466593.0,Swimming-Cake-4735,relationships
My partner (M25) gave me his honest reaction to my (F20) body,"

I was talking to my partner about how I had cellulite, even when severely underweight. The context behind this was because during a time I was fit and curvy, I still had cellulite. He had made comments then as I had gained too much weight, based on cellulite, despite me having it at any weight. 

I was recovering from an eating disorder at the time, and I was very proud of the body I had. Until it was mentioned I had gained too much. I slipped back into an eating disorder, and I was trying to get out of it by mentioning I'd have cellulite either way, and I'm still healthy. Well, my plan didn't go as expected. He gave m his honest opinions. 

""Oh my God, how could you let yourself get to that point?""

""It just sucks"" 

When I said that I was sorry for having a fucked up body, he responded with, ""It was beautiful, it was your mind that fucked it up''. 

He brought up that my self harm scars were the equivalent of me getting cellulite. When I tried correcting him, that my sh scars were the cause of pain, he said it was stupidity. And that gaining cellulite was a form of self harm. 

He tried to make me feel better by saying there are ways I can get rid of it, but I eventually had enough and told him that he's the only one concerned about my cellulite. 

He told me in the end it doesn't matter, but he's already given me his honest reactions. That, and he said that cellulite reminds him of his grandma. 

I feel so insecure with my body now, and I don't think I ever want him to look at my ass-- let alone my body if I gain any weight. 

What should I do to feel sexy and secure in my relationship? Or how can I get past these comments and gain back my confidence?

I [24F] don’t want to furnish a guest room for my mother [64F] in my new home.,"TL;DR 
Mom is very excited that I’m going to have a spare bedroom. I’m flooded with apprehension. I don’t know if my feelings are justified or not.
——————————————————————-

My partner [24M] and I are moving into a 1300 sq ft 2/2 townhome this week. Our current apartment is a snug 350 sq ft 1/1. 

I’ve been working from home out of our bedroom since mid-March. This hasn’t done wonders for my mental wellbeing. Moving into a bigger place has been a light at the end of the tunnel these last few months. 

I’m particularly happy about having a second bedroom, as my partner agreed that I should turn it into my home office. (I expect to continue working from home for quite a while longer.)

In my excitement, I told both my parents all about the new place as soon as our application was approved. 

(Context on my parents: My parents are divorced. They live in my hometown, roughly an eight hour drive away.)

When I mentioned the second bedroom in the townhome to my mom, she immediately began talking about staying in “her guest room”. I told her that I was going to turn the spare room into a home office, but she just replied “with a sleeper sofa!” She then began talking excitedly about how she’d be able to drive up and visit “often”. I didn’t know what to say, but something in my gut turned.

My mom works at an airport in a COVID hotspot. I have asthma that gets worse when I get sick, so I can’t take any chances with COVID. Knowing this, my mom has been trying for months to push me to visit her, and she’s been asking repeatedly if she can come visit me. (She has outright refused to quarantine herself for two weeks prior to seeing me.)

I put my foot down and told her that any travel was out of the question, and she kind of accepted that. She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn’t work, she asked if she could come visit in August to “see the new place” and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response.

At this point, I’m not even sure if I’d want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn’t get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she’s also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests. 

She’s constantly offering to give me money I don’t need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me *and* pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I’m never relying on her financially again.)

I almost think she’s generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don’t think she’s doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy.

In the past, when I’ve told her “no”, she has gone straight to guilting me. 
On one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner’s family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I “didn’t want her”, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn’t have room or an air mattress, so she’d have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way *back* home overnight, after having driven all the way *from* home that day. When we didn’t back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn’t sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation. 

My partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn’t want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he’s the reason why she can’t stay with us, but that’s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don’t want that.

***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings:
How do I tell my mother that my home office isn’t her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can’t come visit me in August?

I don’t even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I’m uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past.

She keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away. 

Reddit, please help?
—————————————————————

Edit: Wow, I’ve never had a post receive this much attention before. 
It’s interesting how many comments I’ve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me “you’ll miss your mom when she dies” and “she’s divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child”.
Here I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y’all for teaching it to me!)

- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad’s health isn’t great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn’t care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she “didn’t want a nappy-haired grandchild”.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she’s under stress, she can act in ways that don’t always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn’t want to save for a month to buy it.)
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn’t seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn’t allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we’re still trying to fix our relationship.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she didn’t step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to “break up” with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him.
- I’m uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don’t.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got “better” after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I’d get anxious again and “lose everything” that I’d built. I’ve been trying to make myself “well” for years. But I’ve never lost control of my life since I got it.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had.

But yes. I’m guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I’ll never get back when *he* dies, but yeah.)

"My (29f) boyfriend (32m) makes ridiculous requests of me when I'm busy, and when I inevitably drop the ball he gets furious...I know it has to be about something else.","At this point I'm wondering if this can even be fixed. We've been together for 6 years with these types of issues for a lot of them, but they appear to be getting worse.

For the holidays I flew to see my family for 5 days. He can't come because for 3 of those days it was going to be just me and my sisters (who I haven't seen in a year). But honestly it shouldn't be a big deal. He's gone away by himself for the holidays before.

Everything was great between us, but while I was waiting at the airport to fly out he texted with his request. He said he was in pain and needed to get in to see a dentist that day. I said I'd try but I wouldn't have wifi on the (5 hour) flight, and googled 2 numbers near him and suggested he call when they opened.

Once I landed etc, my sister picked me up and we spent the next 2 hours straight talking. By then any dentist would have been closed, and truthfully I kind of had forgotten. I assumed he would have called dentists and gotten himself an appointment.

He texted me saying:

Him: any luck?

Me: no. :(  didn't you get in to see one?

Him: no...did you even try?

Me: I can try tomorrow morning.

Him: so you didn't even try to help me when I asked, and you didn't even bother to tell me you weren't helping me.

I then said that I was indisposed most of the day and that he could make an appointment for himself much easier than I could on a travel day. He said he was in ""too much pain"" to make an appointment (I honestly doubt that for many reasons) and proceeded to become very angry. Calling me self centered, selfish, etc. Saying if we can't count on each other, what is the point of even being in a relationship? For the record, it's not like he ever does anything like this for me, nor do I even ask him to. He continued to insult me saying that I think I'm ""fiercely independent"" (I've never described myself like that) and that he thinks people who feel that way will die alone.

I admittedly started getting angry at him as well because he has a strong tendency to do things like this when I'm busy. It ended up being a very nasty texting argument that put a damper on my time with my family.

When I tell him that I feel he's doing this because he doesn't like when my attention is off him, he says no way, that's not true. And tells me I'm self-centered and gaslighting him. From my perspective he keeps inventing ""crisis situations"" that aren't actually a big deal and causes a lot of weird chaos.

I do want to be with him, but I don't want these issues all the time. A couple of years ago it was pretty bad and I insisted he get a therapist. He then told me his therapist said I'm no good for him, but he wants to be with me anyway because he's in love with me.

How on earth do I deal with this? I want for us to be healthy. With normal communication. It feels like this is very abnormal, but when I point it out he just tells me that I don't accept responsibility for my part in the conflicts. But that's because I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.

Are we just doomed? Should we try couple's counselling? At this point I'm truly confused.

Husband wants me to stop eating sweets,"The recurring issue: I (32F) like sweets. My husband (34M) dislikes me eating sweets and complains when I do. I get upset when he complains about me eating sweets. He gets upset that I get upset.

The latest example of this recurring tension: we got into a big argument because I made an 8x8 inch tray of brownies, about 2/3 of which I ate over the course of 24 hours. (He ate the rest, plus an ice cream bar.) Later on, he said that he was really disappointed in me that I bought the brownie mix at the grocery store, because he had been hoping that we could eat healthier as a family. I replied “Jesus Christ,” and stormed off.

His arguments:

* I don’t take constructive criticism well and overreact. I am too sensitive to his feedback and take things too personally.
* He wants me to grow and become a better person. How can I improve unless I listen to his constructive criticism? He doesn’t want us to stay stagnant, non-developing people in this relationship.
* He wants to set a good example for our child. He doesn’t want the baby to watch mommy eat sweets and normalize bad eating habits.
* He doesn’t want to censor himself in our relationship. He should be able to share his feelings with me without being afraid that I will get upset with him.  
* Wanting me to cut down on a sugar is a legitimate health concern. Sugar is bad for our health. He wants me to be healthy.
* In the past I asked him to switch from smoking weed to eating weed gummies because I was concerned about the health of his lungs. If I can ask him to make a positive change for his health, why can’t he do the same with me?

My arguments:

* Me eating sweets 1-3 times a week is a harmless vice. It’s not as if I am binge-drinking (which I can’t do anyway since I’m breastfeeding) or snorting coke or shooting heroin or driving without a seatbelt on. Would it technically be healthier if I cut sugar completely out of my diet? Of course. But his degree of concern and frequency of complaints don’t match the severity of the “crime” especially since I have told him multiple times that I don’t appreciate his unsolicited comments about my diet. Examples of my evening sweets: a pack of Pocky, a mug of hot chocolate, a spoonful of peanut butter. (He also doesn’t want me eating peanut butter anymore, period, not even in sandwiches.)
* His “concern” about my health would feel more valid if I were struggling with obesity or cholesterol. But I’m not. I am 5 foot 6 inches tall and weight 141 pounds. Since giving birth 8 months ago I have lost 30 pounds (on top of the additional weight lost from pure baby + placenta). My overall diet is actually pretty healthy compared to the average America: mostly plant-based and mostly un-processed.
* Once the baby is older, I will of course try to set good examples with eating healthy things and in moderate. But this argument feels emotionally manipulative and not in good faith.  
* I feel that he is being hypocritical. In general, he eats way worse than I do. Anytime I bring home a sweet he eats it too. Plus, he eats second dinner most nights, usually consisting of greasy meat + cheese something-or-other. His breakfasts are eggs + cheese + English muffin while I usually have dairy-free oatmeal or spinach smoothies, etc. He loves his potato chips and salsa. He eats an edible every single night and he gets the munchies. He gets to enjoy his vice (marijuana) but I cannot because I’m breastfeeding. I don’t get to enjoy the luxury of being high as a kite every evening; I am stressed out and would like an outlet too.
* I don’t want “constructive criticism.” I feel like him choosing his battles and not nit-picking about everything I eat is a small act of common decency and not me “censoring” him. He should save raising concerns for more important matters, not whether I drink a glass of chocolate milk. I feel so worn down and small and exhausted by him nearly daily getting on my case about something I did wrong, and I’m tired enough by the baby already, I just want him to cut me some slack. For example, we had an entire, recurring similar argument around him criticizing my cooking. I would make the meal and he would feel the compulsion to tell me what was not good about it. I told him that I just wanted him to say “thank you” and some element that he liked, even if he didn’t like 100% of it. This baffled him. “But how am I supposed to give you constructive criticism?” he asked me, “How can you improve if I don’t point out the ways the meal could have been better?” I asked him if he liked my meals or not, and he clarified that he almost always does, he just knows that there is always something that could be improved, and don’t I want to know this? Why am I so sensitive about this? Why am I taking this personally?
* Yes, I have an anger problem. He stays cool as a cucumber and I get heated and raise my voice. But it frustrates me when the conversation veers away from the mean thing he said that made me upset and instead toward the way in which I am being upset.

How do I handle this? How do I propose a solution going forward with him? How do I communicate my position better?

My (26F) husband (30M) made a joke about my weight,"I (26F) have been with my husband (30M) for 4 years, but we got married earlier this year. 

In the past he has made comments about my weight when we first started dating.  I’m 5’3” and I was 135lbs when we first met, and he told me I was the fattest girl he’d ever been with (his ex was 95lbs). I dropped down to 115lbs (I was getting into 5ks)  and he would say things like “when you were fat”. I would tell him I was never fat and it’s hurtful, but he would say I’m in denial. He said these things also knowing that I had an eating disorder in my teens. All of these instances are from over 3 years ago. 

Last week a family member came from Germany and gifted us a box of assorted chocolate. There are 2 of each kind of chocolate so we shared the box. We were trying the chocolates, and I was taking a tiny bite of each one to taste it. All together I MAYBE ate 1 piece in total. I said “this is my dopamine hit for the day” because I had recently run out of Adderall, so it was a joke all day that I was chasing a dopamine hit because my ADHD symptoms were not being managed by my medication. 
He responded with a “joke”, saying something along the lines of “Why can’t I lose weight? Maybe it’s my thyroid” in a silly voice. For context- 2 weeks ago my doctor told me my thyroid was on the lower side so she wanted to monitor it. 

I immediately called him out on it, asking why he’s bringing up my weight when nobody was talking about that, and even going so far as to bring up my medical issues. He kept saying it was just a joke he took too far. I’m not even trying to lose weight, so I wasn’t sure where the joke was.
I’m 5’3” and I’m currently 120lbs and this is the first time in my life I actually like how I look and feel confident about my body. I asked him if he thinks I’m fat or if he thinks I need to lose weight and he kept saying no. 

I know his childhood was really messed up (my therapist compared what I told him to a book called “A Child Called It”), and that his Dad would pit his brothers against one another and they would ruthlessly bully eachother- but he refuses therapy. We’ve talked about this a couple of times since it happened, but I still can’t get over it. He’s apologized profusely, claiming it was just a joke and that he thinks I look amazing, but part of me can’t believe him. I don’t know how his brain even got there, and why he would say it.  I would never say something like that to him. I haven’t been able to shower or change in front of him because I’m feeling insecure.

How can I move past this or explain it to him that makes him understand how hurt I am? I can’t tell if this is something normal or not.

TLDR: My husband made a joke about my weight.

Update: Thank you to everyone who commented. I want to clarify that he hasn’t made hurtful comments in over 3 years, but I still don’t find them acceptable. I know he can be loving and caring, but that doesn’t excuse anything. Thank you for helping me realize this is emotional abuse. After looking into it, I found multiple things that he does that would also be considered abusive. Neither of us grew up with an example of a healthy relationship, so I didn’t know this wasn’t normal.

Update: My(M40) wifes(F35) career choice has turned into a social event. We’ve been married 10 years and don’t know what to do. What is the next step for me?,"Original post

Hi everyone, 

I apologize, but my last post was deleted. I didn’t title it properly. 
 I received many requests for an update on our situation. I also want to thank all of the people that had positive and empathetic responses to my initial story. 

A lot has unfolded in the time since my wife’s night out. After noticing the flirtatious text messages, I asked my wife to see her phone, I told her I wanted to see what else she had written. She gave me access to her phone and upon doing a deeper dive, I saw that the flirtatious messages went far beyond anything I would’ve expected. The man she was messaging had recently broken up with his girlfriend, and my wife’s response to him was that things aren’t going well in our marriage.

I also found out that while we were on vacation(in the area he lives), she went to the gym and met this man there to workout. This news was devastating to me, not only was I disgusted to find out that she met with him behind my back, but I was blindsided to see she mentioned to him we were probably heading towards divorce.  

We had a difficult week after that, she was ashamed of her actions. The drinking, the messages to this man and the meet up.  She described that she feels like I hate her which really hurt because I feel like I do everything I can to make her happy. 

She swore to me that nothing physical had happened. After looking through the messages, I do believe her. It seems that she didn’t find out that he and his girlfriend broke up until he texted her after the gym. He actually stated in the messages that while he is attracted to her, he didn’t want to get in the way of our marriage and that he didn’t want to be a distraction while she and I tried to work things out. (I have to commend him for that) I told her that it was imperative that she confesses if anything physical had happened. I was willing to work through anything, but if I find out later down the road that she lied, then she would not get another chance. 

I also discussed the importance if anything happened for the sake of our health and our children’s health that she would need to go get tested. She was also on her period while we were away so I’m confident there was no physical interaction. She has been adamant that nothing happened but she knows what she did was wrong. She did agree to get tested to give me peace of mind and everything was negative. 

I had a few sessions with my therapist and she recommended a couples therapist for us. She also mentioned that she believes my wife has some deeper trauma that she needs to work through. It’s obvious that her judgment is off and that there may be some reason as to why she is acting out.

My wife has since seen a therapist on her own and we have sat with a couples therapist. Our first session with the couples therapist was very educational. She did a dive into our relationship from the beginning, the main reason that we sought out her help and laid out a treatment plan. Next week we will be starting individual sessions with her and then couples sessions following that.

We both know that there is a lot of work to do, but we are dedicated to making this work. I myself had a very unstable childhood due to my parents divorce. When I made those vows to my wife, I fully intended to see them through and I believe she did as well. I feel very confident after speaking to both therapists that couples can heal, move beyond an act of infidelity and can come out even stronger than before. 

 I owe it to myself, my wife and my children to do everything I can to commit to having a happy and healthy relationship. My wife is showing great remorse. She said she doesn’t know why she does these things but she knows it’s wrong and she wants to stop. She is seeking the necessary help and knows she has a lot of work to do. 

She’s fully aware of the damage she has caused, she knows I’ve lost the ability to trust her in social settings and it’s going to take a long time to earn that back.
She has since ended any and all conversations with this guy. She has offered to quit her job(I’m not sure if that’s going to help) I believe she does get a sense of purpose from it that she doesn’t get at home. If she can’t control herself at these “ work” events then I can’t trust her to control herself anywhere. She had plans to go away for the yearly work retreat(national meeting) later in the year, she has made the decision to cancel those plans.

TL;DR,
I found more troubling messages from my wife to another man.  We have taken steps to repair the marriage, we both have individual therapist and a couples therapist. We both want this to work and are committed to each other and our children. ",1723772931.0,No_Educator757,relationships
Girlfriend wants me to go LC/NC with ex-wife,"This has become an ongoing issue and I want to know if I’m in the wrong here.

For backstory, I (46M) married Alex (42F) when we were both in our 20s. We were together for 12 years and had our two daughters Hannah (16F) and Harper (14F). Alex came out to me as bisexual a few years into our marriage. She also struggled with severe postpartum depression after the girls were born that never seemed to go away even after they were well past the toddler years. When Harper was 4, Alex told me she’d been struggling with her sexuality for a long time and she now understood she was a lesbian and we should separate for both our mental health and the sake of our girls. It was a hard adjustment but after lots of therapy and talking at length to her and with friends, I accepted that she had truly spent a long time repressing this aspect of herself due to her religious upbringing and that her depression had a lot to do with hiding herself. She also said some truly touching things about how she was confused for a long time because she thought of me as a perfect husband and that her inability to love me the way a wife “should” made her feel like it was her own personal failing that she could overcome. Alex has since gotten remarried, and her wife, Meg, is a solid gal and clearly makes Alex very happy. It’s taken a lot of work but at this point things are great between the three of us and we’re all three very invested in making sure the girls always have a healthy family environment between our two homes.

The other relevant thing about Alex here is that we are very similar people who have always had a great friendship dynamic; we’re both formally trained in the fine arts, work in creative fields and into lots of interesting artistic/creative hobbies that we’d explore and work on together and separately. So even after we divorced, we have kept in more frequent touch than most co-parents I’ve met who can’t stand each other. Part of it is because the marriage really ended over something neither of us could change and with no cheating or bad blood, and part of us is that we are genuinely friends with common interests. For example, our girls are involved in community theater and the other week they had some friends over to Alex’s home to work on some set and prop painting, and I went over to help out with some of the more complicated construction work. Or if one of us is working on a project and needs tips or to borrow a piece of equipment the other person has, it’s no big deal. Nothing outside the norm of what I’d do with any of my other friends. She and Meg spent a couple years fixing up their property and renovating the guest house into a studio so she had a dedicated space to work, so between the two of us we’ve always got some project we’re puttering with, whether it’s furniture or metalwork or sculpture or what not. 

My issue currently has arisen since I started dating Lisa (35F) about a year ago. Lisa has had issues with my level of contact with Alex from the very beginning and seems unwilling to accept that our relationship is strictly platonic and a very deep and sincere, respectful friendship/co-parentship. She is chilly to Alex when they’ve been forced to interact and disapproves of us having any kind of contact that isn’t solely about the girls. Alex, Meg and I have a shared calendar app with all of our schedules synced so that we always know what kind of events/school projects/practices/games, etc. they have coming up and so that nobody’s thing gets forgotten, and Lisa told me a few months ago that she needed me to respect her “boundary” by adding her to the shared calendar - she has zero responsibility for the girls so I truly saw no need but this is the kind of thing she couldn’t handle not having access to. Then a few weeks later, Alex dropped by to return a soldering iron she borrowed and Lisa was home but I wasn’t. According to Alex, Lisa told her to never come by my home without contacting her first - Lisa says she established another boundary but I think it’s a ridiculous demand on the mother of my children who may have any number of reasons for dropping by unannounced to Lisa. I don’t think it’s fair to any of us that she should have to clear it with Lisa before dropping by to hand over something one of the kids leaves at her house, for instance. She also took a lawn statue that Alex and Harper made for me for Father’s Day to the city dump without my knowledge or permission; Harper was particularly upset about this and I just about hit the ceiling when I found out. Lisa didn’t know that Harper had a hand in making it but she called it “a piece of trash” and generally dislikes the arty, bohemian crafts and projects the girls tend to bring with them over from their mom’s house. Shr also recently insulted a necklace Harper and I were making together (she's gotten into metalsmithing) because she thought it was Alex’s work, which didn't help. 

Lisa clearly feels some degree of jealousy and uncertainty when Alex is around. I have told her every time this comes up that Alex is not, under any circumstances, a threat to our relationship, as she is GAY and very evidently happily married. The difference between the depressed, repressed, brittle woman I was married to and the vibrant, easygoing person she’s become since we separated speaks for itself. I have no intention or desire to ever rekindle our relationship, and the last woman I seriously dated understood and accepted this. 

Lisa now wants me to essentially reduce our communication to the absolute bare minimum and never speak to Alex (or Meg) about anything other than our daughters. She has requested that I move all my communications with Alex to a group text including herself and Meg, to keep the conversations minimal and restricted only to logistical talk about the girls, and that any attempt to subvert these restrictions will be received by her as inappropriate communication with dishonest intentions. Once they turn 18, she says there should be no reason for me to have any kind of contact with Alex. She again couches this in her “boundaries,” which drives me nuts. The relationship is quite good otherwise and it’s just this one issue that makes her go insane, but I don’t think it’s going to be tolerable or sustainable long-term. For what it’s worth, the girls don’t like Lisa at all and say she basically ignores them completely when I’m not around; Lisa says they give her an attitude and “clearly don’t want her in their lives.” I don’t know how much of each side is the objective truth but I will make a note that Meg and the girls get along great and they call her their bonus mom. They had no problems with my last serious girlfriend either. Lisa and the girls don't have much in common with interests either and I think they make each other feel insecure in different ways.

I’ve been weighing breaking up with Lisa over this but it really is just the one issue weighed against the rest of a happy relationship. But I really dislike constantly having to defend myself and my relationship with my kids’ mom and my friends against her paranoia that I’m somehow going to cheat on her with a happily married lesbian woman. I also don't want this to affect my relationship with our kids or, frankly, with one of my best friends.

UPDATE My (26F) ex boyfriend (27M) and roommate (25F) are still hanging out and it's bothering me.,"Here is a [LINK TO ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/epmnay/my_26f_ex_boyfriend_27m_and_roommate_25f_are/) In summary, my ex and my roommate decided that they will continue to hang out together. 

So, the past week has been really hard for me. I am thankful that my boss is giving me 2 days off to recover and get back on my feet. Forty-eight hours after the breakup, I talked to my roommate and she said that while she understands how I feel, she will continue hanging out with him. I also talked to my ex and told him how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. He also said he understands, but thinks it's controlling of me to ask them not to hang out. Last week, they hung out for 5 days, for hours on end. They did respect my requests not to come inside the house when together, which I appreciate. 

Many posters suggested that they were having an affair. My ex claims that he did not break up with me to get with her. I did believe him at first, and maybe it was somewhat true, but I now think that something is going on and was going on. I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. Turns out I was onto something. I suspect they are now trying to hide their relationship from me, though I cannot be sure.

Two days ago, I told my roommate that I no longer think it is healthy for me to live with her. She was fine with this and is asking around for places to stay. I will also consider leaving if she cannot leave. The most crushing thing about all this is that the two of them were people I considered best friends. This is also happening LESS THAN 2 weeks after the break up. It feels weird and rude to me. Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. Maybe in time I'll be happy for them. 

TLDR; Ex and roommate hanging out still, I suspect something is going on and now they're hiding it from me.


Edit: you all are so kind! Thanks for the words of encouragement, tough love, and shared experiences. I am staying with a friend tonight and am hoping that the move-out situation goes smoothly. Living apart from my current roommate is the only viable option for me, moving forward. I will also be cutting contact from both of them as soon as the living situation is settled. 

I am going to therapy tomorrow, and went last week, so I’m hoping that helps. I am so thankful I have off from work. It’s been nice to just be able to rest.

How to relax into a healthy relationship and stop needing the highs after toxic ones,"Looking for some advice and words of encouragement here. 

I (29F) was in one toxic relationship for 7 years, spent the last two years slowly detaching and left. Alcohol and manipulation were major issues in this one and it took a long time to break that codependency. I was relieved when I finally left, did a bunch of therapy leading up to and after that relationship. 

I then found myself falling head first into a second relationship that seemed great but in hindsight was full of love bombing and false promises that led to emotional abuse and living in chaos. The issue with this one is that for the first year it felt truly perfect and I had never been more in love. He was fun, energetic, deep, emotional (in good ways but also bad), smart, and I felt on cloud nine all the time. The last 6 months were so hard due to his issues regulating emotions and ability to cope with stress. I knew I needed to leave, especially when I became his scapegoat and person to blame as to why he was constantly crying and nauseous and not managing. Leaving this one broke me arguably more than the first because I thought this was my forever and I genuinely wanted it - before he flipped and everything went crazy. To the point of crying on the floor, needing weekends or weeks apart at an Airbnb because he needed a controlled environment with endless alone time to regulate, couldn’t sleep in the same bed, was throwing up daily and would freak out at me over nothing. 

It’s now only been 6 months since the official split but I met someone through work (35M) (long distance) who is incredible in so many ways and I am now in a relationship with. I was hesitant getting into this because of the short amount of time but I also recognize I can’t control when I may meet someone and he’s not one I would want to pass up. My issue is that I’ve been experiencing some anxiety and almost element of relationship OCD. He checks off all of the things I am looking for in terms of the important stuff - core values, shared interests, similar goals and wants out of life. He is kind, compassionate, stable, and I know he will be an excellent partner and father one day. My friends and family adore him and there are truly no red flags. He is mature, has done work on himself, and is so committed to working through things. I don’t think I will ever experience him yelling at me which is not what I can say for the environment I grew up in or either previous relationship. We have great sex, we travel well together (which we know because we started this thing from a distance), and I am going to be visiting him for 5 weeks this summer both for work and to see how things go on a longer basis. 

My issue comes down to me fixating on the fact that compared to my most recent ex who I was deeply in love with, he is quieter and not the “golden retriever” type energy. My first relationship also wasn’t that and it was fine, but for whatever reason this is what I’m fixating on. I’m realizing with time I don’t think it’s my boyfriend that is the issue but rather that this is the first healthy dynamic I’ve been in and I almost don’t know what to do without stimulation. I’m both prior relationships I experience high highs and low lows and I grew up in that environment so I think I became addicted and that’s what I equated to “love”. I just wish I could get out of my head and get the anxiety out of my body. When we are together travelling or doing an activity I am having fun, and when we’re watching a show together in the evening or whatever I feel so comfortable. My issue is the in between and that I apparently don’t know how to handle healthy boredom. 

Has anyone fixed this issue? I was worried I don’t like him enough but I don’t think that’s the issue, I think it’s me. I am sure some of it is likely due to the little time between the two relationships also so comparison is high and I am still healing. I just want to stop the random spikes of doubt or anxiety. And why did I never have anxiety when being love bombed but I do now?

My (36F) aging cat has become a strain on my relationship with my boyfriend (38M)," My boyfriend and I have been together for just under 4 years, living together for a year and a half.

I have pets from a previous relationship where my ex adopted animals without my knowledge or consent, and I now have 4 of them. They’ve been in my home and family for anywhere from 7-11 years. (So my partner knew my situation before moving in.) As such, all of my pets are aging and require different care. 

In particular, my cat has been having problems that are stressing out my boyfriend and making him anxious. She is about 12 years old and has started to pee herself in her sleep. It’s not every time she sleeps, but she sleeps on our bed. (I can’t kick her out of the bedroom due to the way the house is set up. It’s a small bungalow and her litter box is in the attic space attached to the room.)

This cat is otherwise happy and healthy and I’ve been taking her to the vet to try and resolve the problem. She eats food, does her usual cat activities, uses the litter box when she’s awake, etc. 
I do not feel it’s okay to euthanize an older animal who I love dearly when she’s not actually suffering.

Every time there’s an incident, my boyfriend will get frustrated, maybe a bit angry, become quiet, and withdraw. I have asked him if I can do anything to help and he always says no. I take on the burden of cleaning up the messes as she’s my cat and therefore, my responsibility. I have waterproof matters covers, enzyme spray, and clean sheets on rotation basically every day while I try even a different vet. Today I bought a washable, absorbent mattress pad in the hopes that we can have protection for the bed.

Last year we had been discussing marriage but I fear that this problem has become too much for him and he’ll leave. What are some other ways I can help my pet that are not at the expense of my relationship? How can I take the strain off of my boyfriend?

"My bf [31M] has been ranting about orange peel theory for days, I [25F] am getting uncomfortable and want him to stop","We've been together for about a year and a half, I am previously widowed (relevant later). Prior to our relationship he's never had an adult relationship, so for a while I was trying to understand that he would make awkward mistakes and we would have to work through them. Lately he's been bringing up orange peel theory quite a bit, sending me tiktoks about why it's unhealthy and bad for your relationship and then later mentioning it in conversation again. It's essentially someone asking their partner to peel an orange and if they peel it for you they pass, and if they don't or complain about it it's a bad sign or whatever. 

I love this man, but this is starting to hurt my feelings and the way he so obviously feels attacked is making me feel gross. I don't know why he's so offended if I'm being honest, this is not a thing that happens for us. I don't test him and I'm always respectful and considerate to him. I would say I do a lot of things for him with or without him asking just because I like making his day better and his life easier. Him staying so heated about this is making me wonder if he feels resentful for being asked to do anything for me, and I have a few past examples that keep popping into my head. 

I had a pet that my husband had gotten for me die before a big event several months ago. I was devastated, and he offered for us to miss but I told him it would be good to get my mind off of it for a few hours. We had a bit of a walk to get there and because I was crying a bit he asked if he could do anything to make me feel better. I'm a big sap and it makes me smile, so I asked him if he could ""romantically ask"" to hold my hand. He just said ""Can I hold your hand?"" and I laughed and said ""More romantic than that!"" This made him mad and he roughly grabbed my hand and started walking. I started tearing up and he told me I was being mean, only apologizing because by the time we got to the venue I was crying hard despite trying to hold it together. 

Another time he had gone to visit his parents and wanted to leave early. My home was closer than his apartment, and I was having a horrible weekend. I was sick and very down. He mentioned he was heavily considering coming to stay with me and I told him I would appreciate it as I was struggling and missed him. Despite him being very positive about it just before, this flipped some kind of switch in him and he said ""I'll come, but I'm leaving FIRST THING in the morning so don't ask me to stay longer."" I got hurt by this and told him to not come at all then as I hadn't even suggested that, and suddenly he's ""Oh no, but I want to be with you. I want to support you, baby. Please let me."" and eventually I relented and he ended up staying into the afternoon 🙄 

I have several other instances of him suggesting he wants to help or be kind to me, but the second I take him up on it or ask for him to alter it slightly he's angry. Then he'll tell me that we just need to ""communicate more"" while he doesn't listen to me and only wants to do things on his own terms. Which is fine if he would say that, but he always tries to spin it back on me victimizing him somehow. 

I'm tired and the now daily mentions of how annoying and rude this trend is to him is getting hurtful, but I have no idea how to address this with him without it being interpreted as me being mean. What can I say? 

**tl;dr my bf hates orange peel theory and keeps bringing it up despite that not being how our relationship operates. I would honestly say that I communicate my needs and wants to him and he gets just as upset about that. I'm trying to figure out how to communicate that this is not something I want to continue going over unless he feels it's genuinely relevant to us, partly because it's giving me a bad vibe about him.**

**EDIT to say I'm really appreciative to everyone who has taken the time to comment and I have/will read all of them. I know this is not a great situation and I have a lot of conflicting feelings about it. I do sincerely love my bf and I also acknowledge that it's not healthy for me. I'm not sure that I'm at the point of leaving (I know), although I've started to become disillusioned. I'll be checking out all of the resources suggested to me and I will see where it goes from there.**",1705710353.0,ThrowRA78562,relationships
"The biggest shock of my life: after eight years of being in a healthy relationship where we traveled around the world, were married for two and half years, now she wants a divorce. And all was fine till this afternoon.","We got together while in graduate school. Love after first beer :)

I am 35 and she is 31

We went on to complete our PhDs, travel around the world, live in some of the best cities in Europe and the US....not just travel, but spend months in one place after another. We froze in northern Sweden, swam in the Amazon river, hiked in dozens of countries and environments, presented and published together....

Our wedding took place two and a half years ago and was maybe the happiest moment of my life. It was only the two of us and our parents. I felt proud and happy.

We struggle financially, and still do (as most people in academia do), but instead investing into TVs, cars and real estate, we chose experiencing different cultures, cuisines and smells.

We just arrived to the US few weeks ago. Settled down a bit, went out for couple of drinks with few old friends of mine, and then came the biggest shock of my life.

We never had one serious fight. We had arguments and disagreements, but nothing to threaten our relationship. Or so I thought.

This afternoon, I saw her a bit moody and distracted. When I casually asked if everything is fine, I expected the usual ""just a bit tired"" kind of answer. Nothing in the world would prepare me for what she said instead. 

""I am in love with your friend.""

I thought it was a bad joke....but no.

My friend who she saw only twice. He does not know and is not his fault. She said that nothing happened, nothing will happen, and she will not tell him. She also asked me to leave and go back to Europe. Apparently, I have entered a friend zone - after eight years relationship. Our sex life was great, and we never experienced any existential threat to our bond. 

I tried talking to her, and was genuinely convinced she had some kind of psychotic breakdown. 

So what the fuck happened? I am now at one friend's place, several timezones away from my family, too broke to buy last minute ticket to Europe (she is the primary bread winner here in the US), and am so confused, sad and shocked I wish it all were a bad dream.

Reddit, I just need some kind of logical reasoning that would explain her decision. I lived through food poisoning, even drank my own piss (it was just a sip, for a bet), got mugged, beaten up, threatened.....but this, this is the worst fucking feeling ever.

I [M34] feel lonely and unfulfilled in my otherwise healthy relationship with my girlfriend [F31] and don't know if I have unrealistic expectations or if I should leave.,"We've been dating for 2.5 years and it feels like a generally healthy relationship. We communicate well, we both contribute as partners for each other (accommodating differences in income and free time), and we have a healthy sex life. The problem is, I feel like we have deep compatibility but not deep connection.

Day to day, it feels good. Things are fun and easy and we work through small problems. Looking ahead to marriage and raising children, I have (what feel like) bigger concerns. She gets overwhelmed easily, and can be very immature at times. We have overlapping values and hobbies, but there are big gaps about where we want to live and how we like to spend our time. To be able to do activities together (e.g. outdoor adventures, books/movies, conversation, aims for the future), I generally have to reduce or modify them to the point that they lose much of what's meaningful about them for me. Even after discussing it and trying more ""parallel play"", most of my meaning-making activities feel like they have to happen to the side, on my own. It feels like there's compatibility, but a lack of depth or connection.

I know it's unreasonable to expect a partner to be perfect or to satisfy every need and desire, and I acknowledge my thinking may amount to that. But I want to share a meaningful life with my partner, doing meaningful things and building a shared life towards a roughly common vision.

I have very little serious relationship experience and trying to explain my ""compatibility-but-not-connection"" feelings makes me feel like I'm being petty or holding onto unrealistic expectations. Is this feeling ""par for the course"" and do I need to learn to compromise more and embrace our relationship, including  areas that feel like they're missing? Or is it reasonable to want more?

My mom has some hoarding tendencies and this guy has helped her get rid of some stuff and start organizing things. Which is great, she really needed that push. But it seems like she tries to get us out of the house quickly whereas I used to spend entire days there while my boyfriend worked. 

For example, I live in a town over and my boyfriend had a concert in the town she is in. He needed me to drop him at the concert and then pick him up when it was over because he planned on drinking. 

I asked my mom if we could hang out until the concert was over and she said yes. When I got there we were fine, just chilling, my other sister (childless) lives in her garage so she came in and we talked and played with the kids. When my mom came inside she said we should go to the park, at 7pm. I was like, no I don’t want to do that. 

Then she said let’s get something to eat and we did (because I’m easily bribed with food). We ended up having a fun time but how she was so insistent about us leaving was out of the norm. 

Children are messy, and I get that, but my mother has never been nit-picky about that stuff because her mother was so strict about a clean home. I feel like, since she’s been dating this guy, she doesn’t want to risk the kids making a mess. She has also said “my door is always open, I’m the kind of grandma who always has her grandkids, I want to see them as much as possible”. Now I feel like I can’t just show up whenever. I can’t just let my kids be kids and if they want to spend the night she always has an excuse. 

I kind of get sassy when it comes to my kids and my mom. So what I’m asking is, what’s a gentle way to approach this? Do I approach it at all? They still have separate bedrooms so I would trust my kids staying the night. 

Other relevant info: my mom has an in home adult foster care. She is working on getting a new client and uses this as an excuse why the kids can’t stay over. But it’s been going on a month now and it’s never been an issue before. Mainly because her space is upstairs and the clients stay downstairs.

TL:DR- my mom has a new boyfriend and I feel like she wants to keep her house clean by keeping the grandkids out

(I am not sure how long they’ve actually been dating)

**UPDATE/EDIT** 
I appreciate all the feedback! I’m using bits and pieces of all the advice and I’m planning on talking with my mom. 

I’m gonna start it off like “So you have a new boyfriend and I’m so happy for you! How’s it going? I did notice that your preferences have started to change. Are there any boundaries you want to set with this?” And “I’m okay with you setting boundaries because you’ve spent your whole life raising kids, I just need to know how to plan time to hang out with you, the kids and I miss you” 

-I know I came off as entitled and this is how I was acting. I realize that my mother deserves this time and relationship and it’s healthy for her to set boundaries. I want her to be happy. I felt like this new guy should get used to how WE do things. But the truth is I need to get used to how THEY do things. I am chatting with her tomorrow evening (without kids).


UPDATE: I talked to my mom and laid it out nicely to her. She explained that her biggest thing is getting organized and then of course she wants the kids over again. I told her to take her time. We also talked about her new relationship and that I knew it would happen someday, I just need time to adjust. She said they are just seeing how it goes and she’s adjusting as well. 

We talked for a while and she gave me details about the relationship and her getting ready for a new client, etc. I told her I would ask in advance when I can come over and she said that would be great. She said maybe we should even have monthly mother daughter dates so we can spend quality time together without the kids. 

I actually started out the conversation with the fact that I posted about her on Reddit thinking everyone would be sympathetic to me. But what actually happened was that I got a big slap in the face with a reality check. She laughed and laughed because she knows it’s hard for me to admit to her when I’m wrong sometimes. 

I just want to thank everyone for their great (sometimes blunt) advice! Lots of people told me very gently and lots of people told me harshly. I am so grateful for both because I am able to see my mother in a new light!",1663163161.0,Resident-Ad2557,relationships
My (28f) boyfriend (28m) of 6 years has only now decided I have to convert to Judaism if I want to marry/have kids with him.,"It’s never been an issue before, we’ve talked about it MANY times. We would raise them Jewish but also celebrate Christmas and my traditions. He never was religious, never even had a Shabbat dinner in the whole 6 years we’ve been together. We went to the synagogue a few times on holidays and that’s it. Since the October 7 war, he has a new found interest in his religion and believes he has to bring Jewish kids into the world to keep his culture going. After 6 years of an amazing, happy healthy relationship he is now basically giving me an ultimatum to convert to Orthodox Jew or we can’t have kids. Only a few months ago we were nearly ready to get engaged so I’m so puzzled and hurt how he can change his mind after 6 years of an amazing relationship….

Do I do it for him? Commit to 2 years of a difficult, lengthy conversion? 

Trust my gut that this is a crazy demand so late in our relationship, break up and be completely and utterly heartbroken?

How can my partner and I (25F) use porn in a healthy way in our relationship?,"This is a complicated discussion, but let's have it.

Do you think there could ever be a version of porn that could be ""healthy"" to watch? After watching porn off and on for years, and finally going porn free, I had to accept how porn made me feel, which was always very empty and disturbed after the fact. (There has been only one very notable exception to this, and I can explain more if people ask.)

I tell people this, and they say it was the porn I was watching that was toxic, not porn in itself. I don't know how people define toxic vs healthy porn, but to me, the average mainstream video on any x-rated site (amateur or not) is not healthy for men or women to consume. (And no, me wanting future partners to not watch this porn is not me being jealous or insecure, as I've had many people accuse me of. Nor do I think addiction is the only negative risk of porn, but rather, how it shapes our perception of sex, women, and hijacks dopamine into watching more extreme, violent content.)

Yet---if I had a partner I deeply loved and trusted and we both invested most of our sexual energy into our IRL relationship---I would not be opposed to them occassionally watching porn, but I don't know how that could look like in a healthy way.

Would you have ideas or any helpful thoughts on this as a whole?

ETA: If possible, I'd like to steer this discussion away from sex workers' rights/independent content, etc. That's another conversation and ultimately not what my question discusses, which is how porn impacts us as viewers, no matter who it's made by or how.

TL;DR I don't like most porn, but I'm wondering if there's a ""healthy"" porn my partner and I can include in our relatonship if the desire arises?",1674811199.0,heatedgrooves,relationships
How do I tell my narcissist mother (65F) that I (29F) already bought my wedding dress?,"My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT.

My mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.

Backstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her ""last dollars"" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I ""wanted"".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.

The first time I told her about the wedding, she said, ""I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!"" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my ""special day"". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  ""Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!"" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos.

I started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one. 

Here's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list.

I'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???

I know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout.

TL;DR:  I'm still a child at nearly 30 who is scared to tell her mom that she bought a dress.",1556722130.0,TheSweatyCheese,relationships
"How do I (F, 27) settle in a healthy relationship when I was in a toxic one?","What I’m asking is, how did you manage to feel safe and secure? I (F, 29) was in a toxic relationship last year for 2 years, the guy (27, M) must’ve left me 7 times and we got back together. I was on edge constantly thinking he’d leave me if I had a small issue with something. He had cheated etc. I finally realised my worth and worked on myself. I wasn’t looking for anyone and then met this guy (26, M) at the gym. We’re taking things slow and he is absolutely gorgeous and lovely. I think my self esteem is on the floor because I’m baffled why such a handsome man would want me. He is very open, communicates well, kind and funny. But because of this I’m confused. I spoke to my therapist and he said it’s because I’m used to chaos and not knowing where I stand. But because of this, I’m starting to feel cracks and worry he’s gonna leave. I’m truly working on myself and shared my worries with him and he told me I don’t need to feel this way. My therapist said he will help me alter my ways of thinking, so I am trying! I did work on myself but just found being with someone new a year, on I am still insecure. Still in disbelief this handsome and lovely guy wants me. Any tips would be great! lol!

"Healthy relationship despite difficult circumstances? (34M - 35F Divorcees, dating 6 months)","34m here. Six months ago I found love unexpectedly. I had been in a previous relationship for 15 years, of which married for 7 years and then separated for only 3 months when I met my new girlfriend. My marriage had ended with a wild 3 month polyamoury phase, so I had been dating for more like 6 months. I went on about 15 first dates, slept with 6 (including my new gf), and have stayed friends with 3 of them. 

I met my ex wife (33F) when I was 18, so had limited other experiences. She is like a sister to me, but the last 5 years of our relationship was difficult, she didn't really love me, and despite learning a lot about ourselves through therapy, she ended it. We have a year old daughter together. I can see that the relationship wasn't working, and feel that gave me a head-start in processing the break up. 

My new girlfriend (35F) is in a difficult situation, she is from Latin America, and had a traumatic divorce from her controlling and emotionally abusive ex husband, in which she became separated from her two boys. They were here in London as a family, but after the separation her ex moved back to their country with the boys. My gf chose to stay in London to work and support her boys and her elderly parents. She feels they will all be in poverty without her making this sacrifice. Without money, her boys education will end at age 15 and her mother won't have insulin. But she is still suffering from these traumas. 

In the midst of all this, we met each other. I love my gf more than I have ever loved another partner. She makes me so happy. Every time I am with her, I come away beaming with a smile on my face. We have a deep, powerful connection and understanding of eachother. She cares for me in a way that I have never felt, and I care for her so deeply also. 

I know people will judge our relationship. I planned to do the logical thing, stop dating and ""find myself"" being single for a year or two, and this girl was just supposed to be some fun. She wasn't looking for a serious relationship at first either, she certainly isn't scamming me or after my money. Are we just desperate fools? Maybe, but we both dated and turned down other options. 

We meet once or twice a week and I long to see her again every time, and she feels the same. I am happy doing anything with her, any TV show we watch I laugh harder than I have ever laughed, every touch I cherish, every love song I understand. And of course, the sex is amazing. I long for a time when I can share the simple joys of life with her, cooking a meal, having a lie-in.

My (20F) dad (50M) is weirdly obsessed with me and I don't know what to do with him,"**UPDATE BELOW**

I don't like my dad. I answer his phone calls because he treats his body horrible and I know one day it'll be the last call. I wouldn't answer otherwise. I know it's bad, but it's just how I feel.

My parents divorced 15 years ago. He convinced me my entire life growing up that my mom was the reason for all of his problems and that she was an overall horrible person. I believed him and looked up to him a lot. I'm not sure how, but I finally started realizing he was full of crap. I really, really dislike him for how much he manipulated me when I was young. He knew that I admired him a ton, and he ate it up and absolutely used it to his advantage.

He still bashes my mom all the time, saying things like ""I haven't gotten sleep since your mom and I divorced,"" ""I was always in shape until after your mom left,"" and even telling me he has dreams about her where they're together- like a lot. It's extremely weird.

He's always been far too interested in my body, noting how I've ""developed"" and tons of other gross things. He's tried to teach me how to masturbate, forcing my hands to do the motion on my leg, and has touched me inappropriately several other times. He is not a good person. He's very clearly a pervert (he's very into women half his age or less), sexist, racist, and extremely close-minded. He's been single with a few girlfriends here and there. So he's been alone for a long time, and it's clear why.

I stopped staying with my dad at all when I turned 18. He threw constant fits about me not wanting to stay with him at his disgusting house, where I would have to clean up after him and use dish soap to wash my hair, etc. One day I told him he was just going to have to grow up and get over it, I live with my mom. I don't like carrying a million things back and forth, because I never had anything I needed at my dad's. He left me about 50 texts and 20 calls that day, all of which I ignored. This wasn't the first time he had done this.

He's been ""obsessed"" with me for a long time, treating me like his wife and making his problems my problems since I was very young. I've always felt like I've had to take care of him. Now that I've moved out and gotten married, it's hardly changed. He keeps track of how long it's been since we've seen each other. ""You know it's been two weeks since I've seen you, right? You know it's been 2 months since I've seen you, right?"" ""When you move back here will I see you more?"" It's also constant calls wanting to talk about nothing for hours. Like I've said, he treats me like I'm his girlfriend or wife.

He's also the biggest drama queen I've ever met. He treats his life like he lives in a movie. It's just the way he thinks and talks, it's very hard to explain but it makes him unbearable to be around.

I don't know what to do about him. I don't want to talk to him or be around him. My husband hates being around him. Everyone other than his family hates being around him. He had a heart attack last year, and that's why I've kept up any relationship at all. He doesn't treat himself any better to prevent another one, so it's hard to feel sympathetic. I just know he's due for another any time.

I went on vacation just last week, and a few days before, my dad called saying he's been thinking about going to the ER because he's been having chest pains and having trouble breathing. He has been having these problems since about June of last year, and he decided a few days before our vacation that he had known about for several months, to finally consider going to the doctor for it. He told me that he ""didn't want to worry me"" and he felt bad getting in the way of our vacation. In other words, he was expecting that if he went to the doctor that we would not go on our vacation and visit him instead. That we would cancel our non-refundable vacation that he's known about. He never ended up going, so the call was purely to be dramatic and worry me for the entirety of our vacation.

What brought on my post is that my dad is having some kind of procedure done to ""figure out why he has trouble breathing."" I can tell you exactly why. It's because he doesn't eat healthy, doesn't get regular exercise, and is an alcoholic. He's been telling doctors he doesn't drink or eat bad. He wants me there at this not-life-threatening procedure an hour away from where I live. Allegedly his much more adult sisters will be there too. He's making me be the primary person the doctor asks on what to do with him despite me saying I didn't want to be. I don't even think that's needed at his procedure. I'm tired of doing stuff just to please him and doing stuff so he wont throw a fit. I don't need to be at this procedure. I'm not his fucking wife. He's just got this creepy attachment to me that I hate. I just don't know what to do with him. I don't want to be around him ever.

tl;dr I don't want to have a relationship with my dad but he's not doing well health-wise- however it's all his own fault. There's also a non-threatening procedure that he feels I am obligated to go to, and I don't want to. What do I do?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for the comments. I can't believe this got so much attention. I can't reply to every comment but I've read them all. Seriously thank you for taking the time to offer me advice and kind words.

I guess I kind of never considered that what I've been through is sexual abuse or abuse at all. I know that's pretty messed up. I can see it pretty plainly now though that what I've been through is a lot worse than I thought. I was honestly really surprised to see people saying this was the worst thing they had ever read on Reddit. I wish I was making it all up. Wait until you know he used to be a youth pastor, too.

I think I'm going to send him a pretty brutal letter explaining what he's done to me and to never contact me again. Though honestly, he's really stupid. Like I honestly don't even know if he'll understand. He's the most oblivious person I've ever met. But that's what he's going to get. I know some recommend that I just ghost him, but if I do that I don't think he'll ever know what he's done and he'll continue to try to contact me somehow. I want him to know how much I can't stand him.

I'm also going to try my best to go to therapy. I know I've needed to go for a long, long, looong time. It's been the money really. I don't have insurance to cover it, but I think I'm just going to give in and do it. I have so much more to unload about this piece of crap. It's hard to even call him dad. I've also got more family issues, and an anxiety disorder! So yeah, I'm going to go to therapy.

Also I'm not going to his procedure. I told him I don't want to be his primary, too. Of course he said, ""Okay. But why, may I ask?"" Because I don't want to? I initially told him I probably wouldn't be able to make it because it was supposed to rain and freeze, and I didn't want to drive an hour in that. His reply was, ""I'll come get you the day before."" I'm telling you, he's oblivious. Then later he told me as if it was a demand that he wanted me there. So yeah, fuck that. I'm not going.

Anyways, again thank you all so much. I feel confident to finally do what I should've done a long time ago. Thank you thank you <3",1674584827.0,ColdMarsupial3925,relationships
UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.,"Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. 

Love to you all.


**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

(UPDATE) My (36M) family is upset I'm 'prioritizing' my BIL over my niece after my sister (27F) cheated.,"Link to original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nsbhlr/my_36m_family_is_upset_im_prioritizing_my_bil/)

Firstly, thank you everyone for your comments, messages, insights and support. It really helped me strengthen my resolve and find solace in what I was doing. I'll address a few concerns/questions that popped up before my mini-update.

Yes, Bill knows Jane is his. When Tom got his paternity test done, he and Bill had him go separately to be tested.

Why am I letting Tom stay with me? Well..he was family for years and for me, you don't just chuck family onto the streets except for extreme situations. Divorce takes a year in my state and Tom is opting to stay to make sure it can all be handled quickly and smoothly to get it finalized as soon as possible. That said, he plans on moving back to his homestate after that so I am letting him stay with me so he can save money for his move and moving expenses. Otherwise, the only places he could afford on his own require 6 and 12 month leases.

Supporting Tom and Bill may result in my sister and I having little to no contact. True, it may, and that'll be our crosses to bear but I can't find it in me to ignore others needing help just to satiate her and excuse her behavior. I still love my sister, whatever my feelings or opinions of what she did or is doing have no place in this, nor is it really the time for me to go expressing them to her. Bill's lawyer says its very likely Bill will wind up with a custody arrangement and he has assured me that if things do go south with my sister that she won't let me see my niece, I'd always be welcome to visit them to see her during his time with her.

Now for the update..its not a huge one but rather surprising. My sister is still being cranky and doubling down, doing all she can to guilt Tom into reconciling and adamant about Bill not being involved because 'she has a husband that just needs to realize they can work through this, Tom is Jane's dad and Bill is not needed'. So..meh there. Last week I went on a fishing trip with both Tom and Bill for the three of us to just relax and forget all this nonsense for a bit. Once we got back my mother showed up to try talking to me about why I am doing any of this.

Surprisingly, we had a decent talk after some heated tension. I wound up showing her the post and while she wasn't happy I was airing our laundry, it helped a bit. Ultimately I was able to get it through to her that given the circumstances and the high probability Bill is going to be a presence in Jane's life from here on out, the best thing for Jane would be if our family and Bill could at least co-exist. I asked her how she would feel if her granddaughter was constantly having to choose who to spend time with for birthdays, graduation, prom pictures, etc, or gods forbid, we all put her in a position that she would have to lie to everyone about what she wanted just to not hurt feelings. It took a while but that seemed to at least get through to her a bit. She's still not happy about the whole situation, but she did agree to a dinner in a public place to meet Bill and some of his family and I'm happy to say that that wound up going off really well and Bill's mother had a good heart to heart with her. So, some progress. Thanks again everyone for the support.

TLDR: My sister is still trying to pressure my BIL into reconciling and mad at me for supporting BIL and her daughter's father, but my mother is at least making some progress towards accepting my niece's biological father.",1624295151.0,Immediate_March_6598,relationships
How do tell my sister her toxic marriage is why I don’t hang out with her anymore?,"I (38F) am having trouble being there for my sister (32F), and I’m not sure how to tell her why.

I’m about two years out of a 17-year marriage that ended extremely badly. We had issues throughout the relationship (as well as a lot of fun), but the last couple years he was intensely controlling, abusive, and violent, and since he left I’ve done a lot of work to recover and get myself in a healthy headspace.

My sister went through a rough patch around the same time my divorce started, and I learned way too much about her husband (37M) during that period to ever trust him again. They’ve been together for years and while he’s never been my family’s favorite (insufferable know-it-all, dominates every conversation, generally pretty annoying), we all just dealt with it because she loved him and we’re adults. 

But since their rough patch, I haven’t been able to be around him. During that time he served her with divorce papers and told her he was going to take their <1 year old baby away and never let my sister see her again. He convinced my sister she would lose in court anyway, to the point that her plan was to give up, sign all the paperwork he gave her, and leave their baby while she moved out of state with our other sister. This all sounds bad, but my sister is extremely naive and also has the worst anxiety I’ve ever seen. She was convinced she’d lose their baby no matter what, and she was so broken down she didn’t have it in her to fight. Anyway, she told me this plan and I successfully talked her out of it, got her a great lawyer, and she was on her way towards accepting their divorce and rebuilding her life when he suddenly changed his mind and they reconciled and have been acting like everything is fine ever since.

During her eventually-abandoned divorce, my sister was terrified of being homeless and not having anywhere to go. I was starting over too, so our plan was that I’d buy a triplex and she and her baby could live in one of the units, me in one, and our little brother (22M) in the third one. I went ahead with that plan and have just been renting out my sister’s unit and let her know it’s there if she needs it.

I cannot be around my sister’s husband at all. I’ve seen behind the scenes. I know he’s abusing her emotionally, financially, and I strongly suspect physically too, although she’d never admit it. 

I am aware that the right thing to do here is support her decision, and grin and bear his company, but I can’t do it. I get that it’s immature of me, but the situation is too much like my own marriage, and I won’t be within 100 feet of it. I especially don’t want him in my new home, which for two years has been a happy, heathy, peaceful safe zone.

My sister basically won’t leave the house without this man (because of her anxiety and also his control issues), and they are literally ALWAYS together. She posted on Instagram a few weeks ago about being sad and confused about why her family never spends time with her anymore. I’d like to gently explain the situation to her, but I’m not sure how to tactfully say “it’s not you, it’s your awful abusive husband we can’t stand.” Looking for advice on how to softly tell her I’m here if she needs me but that I’m unwilling to be around her husband.

TL;DR How do I tell my sister that I love her and want a relationship but that I can’t be around her abusive husband because he triggers my own relationship baggage?",1663682694.0,AmberSnowSex,relationships
I (27M) feel terrible & depressed because my girlfriend of 3.5 years (26F) can't perform sexually due to a health condition and doesn't value physical intimacy. What can I do?,"This is an odd one. I've been with her for 3.5 years, though most of it long distance, so our time together was limited to a couple months each year. Recently she finished school and moved across the country to be with me, before she did I expressed my concerns that I didn't want to be the reason she'd move and that I can't promise we'd end up together. She moved anyways, we've been living together for about 6 months. Things have been going alright, but lurking problems with our sex life have come to the fore.

She has a health condition which limits her ability to move her hips and limits sensation - that's as specific as I'll get. Otherwise she's very active and lives a normal life. I'm her first sexual partner, but she is not my first. Sexual contact and quality time are how I best ""hear"" the affection of a partner, I've always been a sexual person. She is not asexual, but due to her condition she simply doesn't enjoy sex and never has - best case she has minimal sensation and worst case she starts to hurt. She isn't vocal, can almost never finish (even on her own alone-time, due to a lack of sensation), and doesn't see sex (or being physically intimate) as a big part of a relationship - I always have. I always have to initiate, and while she will reciprocate it almost always feels somewhat forced on her part, like a chore, which leaves me feeling utterly terrible. I've communicated my concern about our sexual incompatibility, several times over the past 3.5 years, and she's always said she will try. My problem is that I'm not sure there's anything to ""try"". I don't want her to have to ""try"". I've tried to get her to open up, to relax and accept herself and be more sexually free, but when there isn't sensation it's just a nonstarter for her, which also means she almost never initiates anything and there's never any romantic interactions outside of the of when we're intimate - it's not how she thinks.

My mind has begun to wander. I remember previous sexual partners and I miss feeling physically wanted and satisfied, I miss having an actively participating partner. I miss the feeling of being able to satisfy my parter, and the intimacy that a good sex life brings into a relationship. I cheated on a partner of mine in the past, immediately came forward with it, and felt terrible - I swore on my life I'd never do that again to someone I love. I'm going to seek professional help but the waitlist for therapy at my University is at least a month, and frankly the therapist is terrible. I'm stuck in a shitty cycle of 1) feeling like I deserve a sexually compatible partner, 2) degrading myself for labeling my girlfriend (in my head) as sexually incompatible with me despite all her efforts and her condition, 3) reconciling with the fact that she has a medical condition and doesn't really have any control over the situation, and 4) trying to understand how to make things work or if that's even an option.

She is a possessive, so extra partners is not an option - and frankly not what I want. I want intimacy with my partner. Her mind has always been on marriage, but I don't see how any marriage can work without intimacy and satisfaction for both partners. What can I do when we've already talked this out and tried to address it for years long-distance, and now months of living together? Do I just squash the part of myself that wants to give and receive intimacy? Am I wrong for thinking that is a requirement of a healthy relationship? Are there other things we can do? I feel like she has no choice due to her condition. I refuse to cheat. The idea of leaving her for something that appears so shallow, when we have an otherwise good relationship, ruins me and will ruin her.

Thanks for the help...

&#x200B;

TL;DR! Girlfriend has a health condition that makes it so she can't really move her hips and doesn't feel much sexually - and her personality understandably does not weigh prioritize physical intimacy. I am very physical and always have to initiate intimacy - 3.5 years on it feels like I am a sexual chore to her - though she will never admit to it. We've always talked openly about trying to fix this, but nothing has worked. I miss the feeling of intimacy that comes with a compatible sexual partner and it's making me doubt an otherwise solid relationship.   


Edit: Just nipping any comments now in the bud that suggest trying to spice things up in the bedroom. We've tried everything you can think of. The reality is that when your partner doesn't feel sexual pleasure that doesn't give you much to work off of. Open to creative suggestions, but just putting that out there.",1573391469.0,throwaway92934me,relationships
What does a healthy relationship look like? This can’t be healthy… right?,"TLDR: what does a healthy relationship look like? I feel like mine is healthy until BF’s untreated anxiety is triggered. 

…

I’ve been with my bf (26f/26m) for just over a year and we’ve lived together about four months. He’s my first proper boyfriend so I have nothing to compare our relationship to. 

Overall, most things are good and we work really well together. We both equally share chores/house work and are intentional with showing each other our love. We align well with big things like politics, future family plans, goals, etc. 

My question stems from a few things I’ve noticed in the year we’ve been together. Namely, he has severe anxiety and is doing nothing to treat it. This has put a tremendous strain on our relationship in more ways than I think he’s willing to admit. 

His anxiety is triggered by surprises or being caught off-guard. He’s also pretty rigid in his values, general things that are important to him, and how he expects people to treat each other. 

Examples (trying to keep them vague for brevity):

- Asked me to do something that I find extremely financially irresponsible. I said no, and we went into a back and forth as to why I didn’t want to do it, and why he thought I should. It seemed like his anxiety hyper-focused on the outcome he wanted and he literally couldn’t cope with me denying him of that. This lead to nearly a week of severe panic attacks which ended in me giving in to a “compromise” that I really didn’t want to do.

- The last time I colored my hair, it led to another anxiety spiral. Tbf, the color was way different from what both of us were expecting. I was planning on keeping it because I knew I could learn to love it. He on the other hand couldn’t handle it because it was a “big, unexpected, permanent change.” I said nothing with hair is permanent, and he’ll get more used to it the more he sees it. He disagreed on ever getting used to it, and said it’ll take so long to grow out that it may as well be permanent. Long story short, after multiple days of this I went back and they colored my hair back to what it was before. (Note: he never explicitly asked me to, but I didn’t know what else to do). 

- biggest thing: he gets really overwhelmed/anxious when I go hangout with friends/family without him. He works Saturdays and explained it essentially as severe fomo and asked me not to go places on Saturdays until he’s off work and can go too. I found that absurd, but knowing he’s been job searching non-stop for a schedule that suits him better, I did stop going out besides running errands (and I never went out often either, so it’s not like I was leaving all day every Saturday). My therapist thinks my presence is soothing for him and that’s why it bothers him so badly (not that it justifies it, and he kind of admitted this later in his own way). However, the same thing happened recently when I went to help a friend out after work on a week night where he was at his part-time job (which he likes). So he wasn’t even home and he still was anxious for 3 days over it (the day before, the day it happened, and the day afterwards). I’m worried nothing will change even after he gets a new full-time job. 

And then some examples of his rigidity:

- Sleeping in the same bed – I found out that he never expects us to sleep apart unless we had a major fight or something. This came up when we were talking about my vomit phobia and he asked what id do if he got the stomach flu. I said that I’d live in the guest room and wear a mask and gloves when I’d go take care of him. He was SUPER offended, basically called me extremely selfish and said he’d never “allow” us to sleep apart like that. I said sometimes when I’m sick I’ll likely //want// to sleep alone so I’m not worried all night that my coughing or sniffling is keeping him up. Nope. He won’t allow it and says that’s his decision if he’s the one who would be kept awake. But anyways, I’m still upset that he views his “rule” as more important than my mental (or physical) health because I can’t even be in the same room as someone who’s vomiting, let alone sharing a bed. At that point, I’d be the one panicking all night. Also… why would he want me to risk getting sick too?

This had also come up when we went to visit my grandma for a weekend. There was a small timeframe where I thought she’d want us to sleep in separate beds. He said he wouldn’t do that and would go stay at a hotel instead (luckily it wasn’t the case, but I’m hurt that it was even brought up… he was meeting her for the first time and that would’ve made a really sour impression and start to the visit). We were also invited to my friends cabin for a night or two and I declined when I learned the room we’d stay in has bunk beds. I didn’t even mention it to him cause it wasn’t worth it to me. 

- My family invited us on a weekend trip. At one point, we couldn’t figure out where to go for lunch. It ended up with my family ordering from one place, and BF and I ordering from another place (because BF has a very limited array of foods he likes, so we found a place that was better for him). The plan was to meet back up in a nearby park and eat there. Well, our restaurant took much longer than theirs, so by the time we got to the park, they had already begun eating. He found this really rude, saying to me “who does that?? Is it really so hard to wait for us?!” I disagreed, because they didn’t know how long we’d be and I didn’t want their food to get cold waiting. This isn’t the first time he’s made comments about my family and it’s really started to get on my nerves. 

Anyway, there’s more but I’ll stop here. When things are good, they’re amazing – when they’re bad, they’re horrible… it really effects me and my mental health.

I just feel like relationships should be easier than this? When I went to help my friend, she casually said something to her boyfriend like “oh, just so you know, me and [friend] decided to go on a trip next year.” And you know what her boyfriend said? “Cool, have fun.” And here I am stressing because I left for 3 hours and he’s anxious over it. Or, I’d love to get a haircut and have my BF say it looks great instead of looking at me and having a panic attack. I used to love going to the salon but now the thought makes //me// anxious because I don’t want a repeat of last time. This can’t be a normal, right? 

(Side note: just want to say I’m not upset with him for his mental health problems. I have anxiety too, which I see a therapist for every week. I’m upset with him for not prioritizing his anxiety and not getting help for it when it has such a profoundly negative effect on him, and then in extension, me and our relationship.)",1628109067.0,Throwwawway1294,relationships
I (22F) am struggling with anxiety in my first healthy relationship with my current boyfriend (25M),"About a month and a half ago, I met a guy who is everything I look for in a potential partner. He’s sweet, thoughtful, respectful, smart, funny, and hardworking. We started dating and he quickly made things official, about a month ago now. 

He’s been great to me. He treats me well. We spend a lot of time together and he seems to enjoy it as much as I do. It’s a big change from my previous relationship experience. My last relationship ended about a year ago, and it was with someone who was both physically and emotionally abusive. My boyfriend does not know about this—he knows it was unhappy, but not the extent. I have been to therapy to process this (though my therapist is currently on maternity leave). That said, I always knew my next relationship would be triggering as I learned to put the coping skills I learned in therapy into practice in the real world. 

That relationship is the only other adult relationship I have to compare this to. It’s better in every way—except I can’t shake this feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop. I keep expecting something terrible to happen. I keep worrying that I’m doing everything wrong. I keep worrying that tomorrow he’s gonna change his mind and hate me—as my ex seemed to change his mind every day. 

I also am not used to the normal progression of a relationship. My last one was intense and overwhelming from the beginning. This has been so much more steady. However, the other day I expressed to my boyfriend that I sometimes feel anxious and in my head about things because I’ve come to really care about him and it’s scary in some ways. His response was that he has deeper feelings for me too, but that sometimes he feels like I’m progressing faster in the relationship than him. He said he does not feel rushed and that he’s happy and feels committed to me, he just also feels that we still have a lot to learn about each other and that he doesn’t want to jump in too hard until we do that. 

The thing is, I don’t disagree with him. I know a month isn’t very long, and I appreciate his honesty and willingness to tell me how he feels. I want to enjoy this stage of the relationship. But I can’t seem to turn off the anxious part of my brain that is telling me that this means he doesn’t like me or that i’ve somehow already ruined things. 

I guess I’m just looking for insight or anyone who’s been where I am. How do I let this good thing be good? How do I get out of my head?

Tl;dr -  I feel anxious in my healthy relationship because I’m not sure if it’s progressing how it should based on my previous abusive relationship. ",1711767456.0,purpsle,relationships
How to stop baggage from getting in the way of a healthy relationship?,"I (24NB) have been in an almost 6 month relationship with my partner (24NB) and have come to a point at which I am realizing my baggage from my last relationship is getting in the way of me being the partner I want to be. 

I have bipolar and it is not insignificant. Many aspects of my life are greatly affected, from me dropping out of school to me being a bad employee, struggling greatly to take care of myself and my home, and past reliance on substances (sober now!!). When my last partner broke up with me he told me that I was too mentally ill to be in a relationship (not be in a relationship with, just to be in a relationship). 

Currently I have been in a very bad place mentally and cannot get past that memory. I have not told my current partner how bad things are for me (my mental health practitioners have been discussing hospitalization), out of the immense fear that I will be a burden or that they will realize they don’t want to be with me. 

I have otherwise been showered in love by my partner, have been told I have been a good partner to them. I know they will very likely support me if I let them know what’s going on but I have only told them that I need a little space for myself due to “big emotions” I need to work on, often leaving conversations with “I’m fine, don’t worry about me! :)”

Part of me feels like withholding this information is creating a burden in itself, but I am so stuck on what I was previously told.

"I [32M] asked my girlfriend [33F] of 12 years to marry me, and she said no, now she is being extremely distant and i am really confused","Me and my girlfriend have never fought, we get along fine. We have been living together for 9 years now, and have been dating for 12 years. We have a healthy sex life, we both have decent jobs that bring in decent money. In the past we talked about marriage a lot and would often joke about what our wedding would be like (yes i know how stupidly lame this sounds), however we always agreed we needed to settle down first. 

We bought a house about a year and a half ago, and were finally able to settle down. Our work schedules normalized, we were able to remove a huge waste of time from commuting, and we were finally able to take various activities after work (e.g. Dancing classes, cooking classes, etc). We were able to finally settle down. 

Finally we decided to take a week off and unplug on the week of 12 year anniversary. She wanted to go camping and hiking, and do the things we used to do when we were first dating. Unbeknownst to her i secretly decided to pick the exact same area where we met to do our hiking/camping trip. 

Two weeks ago as we are leaving she realizes where we are going and becomes ecstatic, and gushes about how romantic i am. More or less everything seems perfect. We do our hike, and we unpack, setup and by sundown everything feels perfect. So i decided to pop the question. 

This is where everything kind of falls apart, i ask her, and she just says ""no"". We literally went from ""i love you's"" to the single most akward silence i have ever had in my life in the time span of about a minute. We sat there kind of not saying anything before she says she is tired and goes to bed. She basically proceeds to cry her self to sleep while i sat there doing nothing. I basically didn't sleep and the next morning, she says she wants to go home. So we pack up and have a really awkward 3 hour hike back to our car. There were a few times where things kind of felt normal and we were joking around like we used to be for a bit. 

On the way back home, we are talking and chatting normally, but it just feels akward. At one point we stopped for coffee, and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened and all i got was a curt ""no"". This is followed by another extremely long silence for the rest of the drive home. We finally get home and i unpack everything while she goes off to bed she is going to bed.

Cue more crying, i tried really hard to talk to her but she pretty much told me that she just needs time to be alone and think. The next day she tells me she is going to take some time and see her family (which is literally on the other side of the country). 

It has been about two weeks since i dropped her off at the airport, she sent me a few messages to tell me she is fine, and that she needs some more time to think. Her best friend has been asking me every other day about what is going on with her, since she hasn't really been responding at all. I know she is okay though due to her posting some pictures of her and her family on Instagram. But it just feels really weird.

I am an absolute giant mess, i just don't quite understand what is going on. None of my friends have really offered me anything of value. I just feel if i didn't ask the question everything would be absolutely fine, and i don't really understand what is going on. 

I keep wanting to grab her laptop to try and figure out anything. I am not close to her parents at all, but i trust her and want to respect her space, but I don't know when she is coming back. I even sent her a message this morning and i know she saw the message and received it. But hasn't replied. 

Also her work has called me this morning asking about where she is. Apparently she had taken an extra week off last week, but she was supposed to be in yesterday.
   
**tl;dr**: Asked my girlfriend of 12 years to marry me, and she said no. Now everything feels like it is falling apart and i have no idea what to do. What should i do?

P.S. I am sorry if this comes off really rambly, i am just trash at writing, and have rewritten this half a dozen or so times. 

*EDIT* To clarify a few things.

The reason why it took so ong for us to get married, is we both agreeded we wouldn't move to the next step until we finished the following:

* We both finished school, for her that wasn't until 2 years ago
* We both had stable jobs
* We had a place where we could agree would be good enough to take stuff to the next step
* We both had decent working hours, for a long time she was doing her residency and we more or less worked opposite shifts.

We did talk about marriage, and kids and both agreeded it would be part of the next step after we got settled.

My dad thinks that it is none of my business if he cheats on my mom or not.,"Hi Reddit. Recently I (18m) created a post about finding out my dad (43m) was attempting to cheat on my mom (44f) using tinder and other messaging apps as an excuse to practice his English speaking. A lot of people suggested I tell my mom so I told my dad if he doesn’t tell her himself I am going to tell her myself and I did. The day after when he came home he was sitting alone at the balcony so I took this opportunity to sit and talk with him. 

He told me whatever he does regarding his relationship with my mom is none of my business and he provides us everything we want, he feels his conscience is very clear and proceeded to tell me about his terrible childhood when his dad used to beat his mom and he would keep his mouth shut to his father and said ""and here you are disrespecting your dad!"". I tried to argue and I said any normal person would say to him but we kept drawing circles in the argument which is his usual strategy to escape arguments. It's like he acts stupid on purpose. So to escape this circle I told him that I make him proud, and I want him to make me proud and that is only if he has a healthy conversation with my mom and he fixes this situation and apologizes. We hugged each other and my mom came to talk with him and she told me to go upstairs. I obliged.

Today mom wasn't looking happy and told me about the conversation she had with him. Apparently he told her he can do all he wants and even cheat because he provides for the family and he demands respect. Also denied my statements about him cheating, never apologized and even insulted her. She can't just divorce because she relies financially on her husband.  My dad can't really either because we are the only thing going on in his life and he probably is not going to get married again at 43. So it seems that the only option is to fix this somehow. I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with this and him. What should I do?

TL;DR Found out dad cheated on my mom, told mom, he says he can do whatever he wants because he is dad and he provides for his family.

I’m (f24) anxious about my healthy relationship with my gf (f21),"So I’ve been dating my gf for about 4 months I’m very happy with her I’ve put alot of emotional effort and work into it. This is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in and it scares me. Not scared I wanna run away, scared that I’m going to lose her. I’ve just never had anyone treat me like this or love me in this way so now that I do it’s scary. She always mentions plans for the future and we keep hitting relationship milestones and they make me so happy but then I get so anxious at the thought of it all going away. Ik obviously I don’t know the future and even good things can go away even this relationship, but I’m having a hard time with this anxiety and trusting the security I do have with her in the moment any advice? 

TLDR: I’m having anxiety about being in a healthy relationship for the first time how do I deal with it?",1706511782.0,afictionalmanswhore,relationships
"Before we were officially exclusive, but AFTER we'd had a couple of ""magical"" dates, my [M29] current girlfriend [F24] of 3.5 months slept with a friend of hers, and separately had an MFM threesome. How should I feel?","My girlfriend Alice and I had a whirlwind romance and immediately fell for one another. Honestly, it was such a breath of fresh air, I have been dating a ""certain type"" of girl for so long and she was so different and friendly - to meet someone I had such an instant connection with who also had all my hobbies and gave me all the best, healthy feedback was amazing. My previous relationships have been toxic or just dumb, like I was killing time with them. I was immediately in love, and really pursued her. Our first date was like meeting the person I'd waited my whole life for, and our second date I pulled all the moves and spent money on a museum and dinner - I felt like we had a very serious connection right away - we spent the whole afternoon/evening together. She felt the same I thought, and gave me every impression and put in effort which I thought was undeniable genuine interest. Our relationship has been incredibly lovely, sexually and emotionally fulfilling, and supportive



Regarding the title, she was honest with me that she'd had a recent threesome and that she saw an old fling after we'd met, but I assumed (tbh I didn't ask for details) that the threesome was before we met, and that the old fling was a ""mistake"" and was able to not think about it so much. Frankly - her previous sexual history is not my business, and I'm frankly GLAD that she has experience. It makes our sex much better. However, we were discussing the other night and I asked for more details, and she said that both incidents occurred after we'd met. The fling came over the night after our 3rd date, which frankly I feel humiliated about because I had some performance anxiety with a new partner and wasn't ""on my game"", so it feels like she had him over cause I wasn't pleasing enough. The threesome happened AFTER that during a trip she took where the whole time I was missing her, and we texted romantically and sexually. ""I miss you""s and ""I hope you're having a great time - I was thinking about your 'yada yada'""



When she returned, it felt like she never left, and I (we?) continued to fall in love. She very rapidly asked if we could be exclusive, as she felt she didn't have the capacity to be with me unless I were willing to commit this way. I had absolutely no problem with this, since as far as I was concerned I already was (I was totally infatuated, I couldn't imagine sleeping with someone else at this stage), and it seemed a good assurance to make to her that we could be committed. However, with this new knowledge, all the magic of our first few dates is gone for me. I feel like she was trying to ""lock me down"" after getting in a couple of cheap thrills first. I feel like an absolute fool for fawning over her while she was texting with these guys setting up plans, and although she was honest about the actual hookups, I feel she's been incompletely honest regarding the timing of it all. I scrolled back in some of our conversations and pictures exchanged, and I'm fairly certain she sent me pictures of herself which she also likely sent to the other men. It all just makes me sick to my stomach. I can't get it out of my head. 



She's been faithful since our exclusivity conversation and she is a sweet, nice girl who's been so so supportive and nurturing. Until yesterday I was SURE that I was totally in love with this woman. She's been amazingly supportive and we have so much in common - I am planning to introduce her to my parents in a few weeks. I love her laugh, her jokes, the way she takes care of me and the people in her life. I was looking forward to us living together, but now even though she technically hasn't been dishonest or unfaithful, it's like all the magic of our relationship is gone. Previously I was ravenous and couldn't wait to be touched by her and now the thought of being sexual with her feels so dirty.



I can't get over the fact that she didn't TECHNICALLY do anything wrong and yet I can't get this bug out of my brain. I have another problem: I have had an incredibly emotional week regarding work and my friendships (which is a whole other story) but I can't tell if I'm overreacting and shooting myself in the foot, or if I'm totally valid in feeling wronged. So, how should I feel? How can I get over this? Do I go nuclear and break up? 



tl;dr: My new girlfriend, whom I developed a deep romantic connection with very quickly, slept with 3 men after we'd met during a period of time that wasn't defined as exclusive, but when I felt committed. I can't get over it because we had been texting romantically at the same time and all the magic of those memories are ruined for me. I'm sick to my stomach and I asked her to move in with me recently. I need to figure out how to get over this, or move on from her even though she hasn't done anything wrong.",1725655557.0,PM_meUrAbnormalNose,relationships
"Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of 2 years, I'm an advocate at our university for safe sex and healthy relationships, and on her 21st birthday I became the world's biggest hypocrite.","Hey, reddit. I desperately need your help. Throwaway because I share a lot of personal experiences on /r/relationships to help people through tough times. Any names are fake.

My relationship with Morgan has been wonderful. We fell hard for each other, took a break early last year to figure some things out, but got back together more ready and appreciative of each other than ever. We have great communication, and through our open and honest relationship I learned that she was physically and sexually abused. Morgan has a family history of addiction, and overcame eating disorders, spouts of alcohol addiction, and has been physically taken advantage not just as a kid, but on our college campus. Despite everything that she's dealt with, she is one of the hardest-working, most successful, most rewarding people to spend time with.

I became a huge advocate for safe sex and healthy relationships after hearing about her experiences. It's a bit of a personal crusade for me at this point, and I'm busting my butt every week to make sure that my fraternity brothers are educated and we tear down the stigma of being a bunch of boys who don't care about anyone else's well-being. I have spent countless hours becoming a better resource and it has made me a better person, and a better boyfriend.

That is until Morgan's 21st birthday. She drank, we had sex, she doesn't remember it. She has reacted in two ways: a crushed sense of self worth, and being unable to distinguish me from guys who took advantage of her while she was passed-out drunk before. I swear to you now, as I've sworn to her that we were communicating during sex, just like we always do. That she responded any time I asked what was okay and what she wanted. I get that a drunk 'yes' isn't the same thing as a sober 'yes', but we've hooked up drunk before and she remembered it fine that time, and even said she enjoyed it. I want to be supportive of her and her feelings, but I also know that in the moment, taking advantage of her never crossed my mind. If she had said 'no, I rather just get some sleep', or even hesitated and had to think about it, I would have definitely left her alone. She has been devastated in a way that I've never seen her before. I've been the one person she's confided in about all the things that happened to her, and now she has no one to go to about what I did to her. She no longer has access to the counseling and therapy she's had for years, which makes this even more difficult.

Of all the people to be caught in this situation, I'm arguably the most hypocritical. I'm the one who teaches day and night to take care of women who have been drinking and to hold off on sex until she's a sobered up a little and knows exactly what she wants. I don't think I'm evil. I don't think I'm a creep. I grossly misread a situation and am trying to make things right again. I've been so flustered and hated myself this past week that I've been more emotional than ever around her, which seems to have pushed her away even more. I want to pull myself to together and use this Valentine's week as a way to help Morgan be reminded that I do care about her... and that I understand the gravity of my actions.

Has anyone ever been in this kind of situation before? How much space should I give her? I never intended for any of this to happen, and had I known she wouldn't remember what happened I wouldn't have initiated a darn thing. I know a lot of you are going to tell me I messed up. I know that. We've talked over this past week and neither of us want to walk away from the relationship. For her it's a matter of feeling safe, respected, and excited around me again... and maybe for me to take myself seriously when I'm giving a talk in front of my fraternity again.


**tl;dr**: I am a peer educator on all things safe sex, consent, and healthy relationships for my university. My girlfriend has a history of sexual abuse and on her birthday it seems like I added my name to a long line of abusers. She doesn't feel the same way about me anymore, but we both want to come out on the other end of this together.",1454941223.0,20yohypocrite,relationships
Update: Am I [32F] being unreasonable with expectations of my husband’s [37M] parental and household responsibilities?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/)

My original post didn’t get tons of attention but I figured I’d provide an update for those interested. 

**TL;DR:** I talked to my husband about how our household responsibilities are far from equally shared. He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well. 

After finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load. 

This came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental “inventory” I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don’t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it’s not good for anyone. A kind of “emergency” situation would arise. 

If my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part. 

After explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his “radar” for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn’t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better. 

He also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he’s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn’t require me asking. 

In the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do “Does not go unnoticed” and that he is so thankful for all that I do. 

It feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here’s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :)

My friends say my mother and I have an incestuous relationship.,"Hello, I tried to post this before but I forgot the tl;dr. I am 16F, my mother is 50sF. I’m writing on mobile so apologies for any mistakes. 

As the title says, my friends and I were recently discussing our relationships with our mothers, and when I went on to describe mine, they looked extremely concerned and said that my mother and I have an emotionally incestuous

To be honest, I was incredibly offended and upset, but now that I think about it, I’m starting to get scared that my relationship with my mother is something other than what I thought it was. 

I always considered my mother and I to be close, both physically and mentally. My friends say that these are the reasons I should move out once I hit 18. 

- My mother walks around naked in front of me, and specifically only me. It’s not like she plays it up or anything, but it happens pretty often. My friends tell me this isn’t normal, and I guess it isn’t, but I always assumed it was because we were the same gender. This was the biggest reason to them. 

 - My mother and I play fight. I playfully bite her, or pretend to hit her, and she does the same to me. She also threatens to hit me when I’m being purposefully annoying, or calls me a “little shit”. My friends say this isn’t normal. 

- My mother and father never had a good marriage and my father and I don’t have the best relationship due to prior abuse. It’s complicated and not the point, but she often vents her frustrations with him on me. He abused her for the entirety of their relationship and she often insults him, yells at him in front of me, or spills out secrets from their relationship (romantically, not sexually). My friends say she shouldn’t be doing this, and I guess I agree to an extent as I often shut down when an argument occurs or I get scared easily, but she’s been abused by him for more than twenty years and I want her to have a safe space to talk about her feelings. 

- She talks to me openly about sex. Not her prior sexual experiences, of course, but moreso what happens, what I should expect, and what I shouldn’t tolerate. I don’t talk to her about my sexual experiences, but I am open about what I think was weird in the experience/what I didn’t like, and she gives me advice on what I should do. My friends say my mother shouldn’t be talking to me about sex period, and I get that, I suppose, but still. 

- She doesn’t like any of my friends or any partners. I get this, because I’ve had some experiences with bad friends and [redacted bc i keep getting weird dms lol]. She tells me it’s because she’s protective of me and wants me to be treated fairly, and I’m happy she watches out for me, but my friends call this overbearing. It does get annoying sometimes, but I get she just wants the best for me. 

- She’s very physically affectionate with me. She kisses my head, hugs me a lot, strokes/sniffs my hair, holds my hand, etc. She does this a lot in public and in private, and my friends say this is weird of her to be this affectionate. Maybe it is, but I never thought it crossed into anything inappropriate. 

- She’s closer than me out of any of our siblings and calls me the favorite (just to me). She’s never treated us any differently to my knowledge and still is affectionate and loving to my other siblings, but my friends say this isn’t healthy. 

I never saw anything wrong with her behavior until this was pointed out to me, and I’m starting to get scared that maybe this isn’t normal, or maybe I’m reading too much into it and I need better friends.

Tl;dr: My friends say I have an incestuous relationship with my mother and listed reasons as to why — such as she walks around me naked, she often vents to me about my father, and talks to me about sex (not her sexual experiences) to me openly. I’m starting to think that maybe they are right.

Edit: Idk if anyone will see this or care but the general consensus seems to be that everything is normal besides the favoritism and venting to me about my father.

I will make it clear I am in no way uncomfortable with anything besides the venting. When I said my mother walks around me naked, I meant that she gets changed in front of me and doesn’t rush to do so. I am not and was never uncomfortable with this, and if I was, it’s not like I couldn’t just ask her to stop. She has always respected my boundaries and my words as the truth. 

I will talk to my mom about toning down the bashing of my dad, and probably tell my friends off for being so weird about it lol. Thank you all for the support! ",1706686935.0,_throwaway_56,relationships

How can I (20m) work overnight while successfully maintaining a healthy relationship with my (18f) girlfriend?,"So for starters we have been dating for 2 months and we work together, were used to seeing each other on our free time, breaks, lunches, etc. We also have one day off together and usually spend it together. Since we work ver similar hours sometimes we'll hang out before or after work, sometimes in person, sometimes on the phone or playing a game. We really value the time we spend together. Recently though I have come under some financial hardships and have been debating on switching to a job that pays more.  
The job has overnight shifts and morning shifts so either shift I take could result in less time being spent together. Also I would be taking multiple hours of overtime so as you can see the time we spend together will absolutely decrease. I will probably work in this job for only a few months, it depends if I find it feasible enough to maintain but regardless I would be working there for a few months and I do not want those months to be hellish for our relationship.  
I have no problem sacrificing some sleep here and there and neither does she its just that I imagine it would be weird for me to be awake while she's asleep and vise versa. People that have done stuff like this before what is the best way to go about this issue? What did you guys do that helped you or still is helping you to navigate through the situation?

TLDR: I want to know how to go from a relationship where we see each other everyday at work and on our off days to one where we wont see each other as much due to me working overnight or a different shift.",1704047894.0,L1ght111,relationships
My boyfriend keeps trying to insert space in our relationship to keep us healthy and it’s starting to hurt it instead,"I’m sorry this’ll be long. Also just to preface: despite all this I know my bf loves me and he makes it very clear. Definitely not a cheater and is very transparent with me. Just had to make that known.

We’ve been in a relationship for 6 months now so not long but not new either. When we first started to date (about 3 weeks before we committed to each other) we had decided that we would try to limit seeing each other to 2-3 times a week so that we don’t become attached at the hip or anything. I was actually the one to suggest this and he agreed as we knew if we started the relationship always together we might be codependent. We did that somewhat consciously for the first month or so and then we just came into a routine and would see each other whenever it felt right (which was still around 2-4 times a week).

Around two months ago he had expressed that at times he needs a little more space because he rarely gets alone time (he has roommates and works in customer service). And he said that he always wants to see me but realized that he needs to take some of his free days during the week just to be alone (not the weekend though since we reserve that for each other) I understood that and it makes sense, I’m the same but I usually have more alone time than he does so I said I would try to be more conscious of that for his sake. So basically for the past two months I haven’t ever asked him to do anything unless it was during the weekends when we already planned to be together. However, he has consistently still asked to see me during the weeks so we still have been seeing each other about the same amount due to his own wanting to see me.

Flash forward to about two weeks ago on a Thursday . I hadn’t seen him since the weekend and he texts me out of the blue saying he’ll be going with his friend to Texas the next day. He has been unable to work his usual job and his friend is a trucker who had to do his route to Texas and said he could come along. This caught me off guard of course but I honestly thought he needed to get out and relax too so I was supportive of it, he wouldn’t be playing around anyways. I asked him if I could see him before he left and he said no and said I’d be able to see him when he came back the next week. Naturally I was annoyed but didn’t say anything because I figured he might be busy or something.

So he asks me what’s upsetting me(it’s hard to hide when I’m upset lol) and I basically asked if he’s busy and that’s why he can’t see me and he said that he wasn’t but didn’t think there was a need to see me because “we see each other all the time” and it would only be a week. This ended up in an argument because of other things he said during this but basically after back and forth I ended up able to see him before he left. 

THEN while he’s on his trip he alerts me that his career plans have changed and he now intends to be a trucker. His friend assured him a job with the company he works for so as long as he gets his CDL in 3 months then he’ll be on the road all the time. He’s absolutely excited about this and cannot stop talking about how eager he is to leave our state and be on the road. 

He came back a week and a half later (they were days late because the truck broke down) and I got to see him on the weekend as usual. I usually leave back home on Sunday nights but he asked me if I wanted to drink at night so I asked if I could spend the night. He kept telling me that if I “really felt like I needed to” then I could, but that he wasn’t planning for us to get so drunk I couldn’t drive home. I asked if I could even if I didn’t get drunk since I missed him and he just said that if I did that we would be seeing each other more than the 2 days we said we would when we started talking so it’s not a good idea. This made me absolutely upset because I didn’t understand why he feels the need to adhere to a rule we set for when we weren’t even in a committed relationship. Especially when I hadn’t seen him for a week and a half and he couldn’t tolerate just letting me stay a few more hours before leaving after drinking.

Believe it or not I know he loves me, this is a very very small portion of the conversations we have and the dedication he shows to me. He’s made it very clear he intends to start a family with me and that he loves me. But I just feel like for some reason he thinks that if we spend too much time together that it’ll ruin our relationship. He and I have expressed that we both had unhealthy attachments with our exes based on spending too much time and I wonder if that’s something he’s trying to avoid. And the two times a week honestly isn’t a problem for me but even when we made that rule we talked about the fact there could be outliers (like drinking and having to spend the night, etc.) it’s started to feel less like healthy space and more like pushing me away. I’m not sure how to deal with this and I also understand I could be being too sensitive about it too. 

TL;DR - my boyfriend has been limiting the amount of time I can see him even though he clearly wants to see me just as much. It’s gotten to the point where it is pushing me away, as we haven’t been seeing each other much already.",1612165729.0,thisisweird100,relationships
My boyfriend [28/m] and I [28/f] have differing opinions on what constitutes a healthy relationship,"Hello r/relationships!  Frequent poster here, but using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my username.

Anyways...this may seem like a silly question to some, but it is what is causing the biggest issue in our relationship right now.  We've been together over 2 years, have a beautiful house together, and, in general, have a great relationship.  But our one sticking point is being on the same page as to what one would consider a ""healthy relationship.""  Both of our parents have successful, wonderful marriages, so we also have great role models from that perspective.  *However*, my boyfriend has only had one other long-term relationship prior to me and that was back in high school.  I've had multiple long-term relationships over the years of varying degrees, so I have a lot more relationship experience than him (I believe this is key to our inability to see eye-to-eye on this issue).

It all comes down to arguing.  My boyfriend thinks arguments are bad and if we were in a healthy relationship, then we should not be arguing or, at the very least, only argue once every few months.  Whereas, I believe minor arguments are normal and having regular disagreements is actually beneficial to the relationship. We've only had a full-blown fight (yelling) twice in our entire relationship and even then, there was no name-calling, no vindictiveness, nothing of that sort...just losing our tempers and yelling our points instead of talking.

I've spoken to both of our mothers about this (his mom and I have a great relationship) and they agree that minor arguments are a regular occurrence in a long-term relationships, which I tried to tell him.  Nope, wouldn't budge on his stance.  We agree on how to resolve an argument (talk it out, communicate each other's points, make a decision together, go on our merry ways), but he still thinks that any kind of arguing should be a rarity in a ""healthy relationship.""

The whole thing is giving me anxiety.  He's a stubborn guy and approaches *everything* in a logical way, whereas I'm on the emotional/sensitive side.  Of course I do not want to argue with him and ignore the small stuff, but then when we actually do argue, he goes to the extreme of wondering if our relationship will work *because of one small argument*, which then turns into a bigger one and me ending up hurt due to his reaction.

Ironically, our arguments are worse because of not being on the same page about arguments...so what do I do?  What can I say?
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I disagree on what is considered a healthy relationship.  He thinks arguing should be basically nil, while I think arguing/disagreements is to be expected in a long-term relationship.

Myself (24f) and my partner (25m) have been together for almost a year. We have a really healthy relationship, we both respect eachother and love each other. But, for me something doesn't feel right.
 

I can envison myself getting married and having a family with him and being happy but I also feel like I wouldn't be at my happiest and that i would be settling.


 There is no one else so that's not the issue at all. We have big differences in opinion in regards to so many political issues that I care about a lot which we usually have healthy debates over but neither of us change our opinion. 


We are at very different stages of our lives, I'm ready to move out of my family's house whilst he isn't ready to move out of his (he says it may be because of his Autism that it may take him a little longer). I want to move to the city I studied my degree in one day (which is 3 hours away) whilst he wants to stay in our home town. 


We don't have that much in common, he's very sporty whilst I'm not; he loves hot weather when I love the snow; he'd rather be up early whilst I'm a night owl ect. He also doesn't communicate when he doesn't want to do something that I suggest, he usually just agrees to make me happy. I've told him a few times that I need him to tell me if he doesn't want to do something as I want an equal relationship and I don't want to be making the decisions all the time but he hasnt taken what ive said in.
 

My family really like him but they have said from the start that he just doesn't seem right for me.
 

I really dont know what to do as I do really love him and the thought of breaking up makes me cry but I feel like something is missing.

However recently he’s been doing things that remind me of my ex and things he did and my head keeps making comparisons between the similarities, making it hard to not think of him. It’s almost like deja vu (doing the same sports, same extracurriculars, etc.) I hadn’t thought of him after I moved on for a while. I don’t want a relationship with my ex nor do I want to reconnect with him, I’m just frustrated I’m thinking of him so often now and think it’s unfair to my boyfriend now. Is there something wrong? What should I do? Has anyone else dealt with this?

TL;DR - moved on from ex and started dating new boyfriend, haven’t thought of ex for a while, but now am thinking of him frequently.",1705944415.0,Pea-sized,relationships
(33f) my boyfriend (35 m) may be co-dependent or does not have a healthy understanding of emotional attunement and boundaries in relationships. How can I open up a conversation about this when he blocks my attempts?,"TLDR My boyfriend (35 m) and I (33f) have been in a relationship for several months and I have a concern that I don't have the vocabulary to bring up with him and I need some perspective and need some advice. I am observing that he is used to co-dependency in relationships and that his affection is only unlocked by people who need him to help, fix, or save them in some way.  
  
My boyfriend has full custody of his daughter who was born while him and the mother were in highschool. 4 years ago he divorced his ex wife who was an emotionally abusive narcissist according to him.  
  
I am concerned because I wonder if he has co-dependent or people-pleasing tendencies that he shows no sign of wanting to heal, which may affect our relationship. He blocks my attempts to talk to him about this and I don't know what words to use to find out this info because I want to know how exactly he thinks a healthy romantic relationship should be emotionally. I feel that he has a hero complex toward his child, which makes me worried that he needs me to be a 'damsel in distress' which I have no interest in.  
  
Example: In his toxic relationship with his ex, he described it as too close as if there were no boundaries between them and that it was an abusive, hellish mess that he never wants to experience again. So I assume that his relationship was unhealthily co-dependent and enmeshed. I'm concerned that he either thinks that this is how all relationships eventually become and he won't ever want a more serious relationship, or that he's too burned out from his ex to even be in a relationship with me that is emotionally connective and intimate in a healthy way.  
  
Example 2: His daughter is VERY emotional, shy and timid. Whenever he thinks she needs rescuing in some way, he is very emotionally attentive when usually he isn't an emotional person. It's like a switch turns on and he NEEDS to save her. I am not a parent but I think it goes beyond the average dad duties cause I've dated dads before. He'll go to extremes to make her happy, but will outright leave me alone for hours with his friends and family at a BBQ, saying that I'm strong and I don't need him. If his daughter is present, I am just invisible to him.  
  
It's his business how he raises his kid, but what I AM worried about is that his emotional attentiveness and attunement seem to be only triggered by the other person being very emotional or distressed and in need of help or if they feel insecure. If that's the kind of person he is attracted to or needs me to be just to get a healthy normal emotional connection or adequate attention from him, then I'm not interested in the relationship.",1693435053.0,Top_Elderberry4505,relationships
My (23 F) boyfriend (28M) pulled my pants down in public as a joke.,"Sorry if this is jumbled with spelling errors or the formatting is wrong but I'm just really upset. 

I've been dating Michael for about 2 years. We met through mutual friends who set us up. It's been so far a great relationship with only minor problems, such as me being not too good at communication and him being immature and jealous. But so far things have been good and it's my first healthy relationship. I love him but what he has recently done to me has really depressed me.. I'm so embarrassed and upset and I am genuinely considering a break up for the first time in our relationship. 

Michael has always been somewhat immature in that he tends to find gross things like farts burps poop and such to be funny and he's always playing jokes and pranking people. Such as putting kick me signs on people's backs, laxatives in people's foods, and lots of prank phone calling that sometimes goes too far. Like when one time he prank phone called my Father and told him that I had been in a serious car accident and might not make it. Which caused my dad to become very distraught and experience a painful pressure in his chest that sent him to the hospital, because by the time Michael told him it was a joke it was too late. Things like that that I just personally in my own opinion find to be immature. He also never apologizes for his actions and never finds anything he does to be wrong or immature. 

This past Friday my best friend Jessica invited Michael and I to a BBQ with all of our closest friends, including the friends who set Michael and I up. I've known some of these people since I was like 14. I was really excited to see them all and just catch up with everyone on how they were doing in life. I was looking forward to this afternoon a lot. 

Well, at the Bbq, I was standing around getting some soda and a hot dog, and just talking to my friends, we were all laughing and joking around and catching up on life. Some of the guys were inside watching a football game. Suddenly Michael comes running from inside into the backyard laughing with another guy friend and they start throwing water balloons everywhere. It was actually pretty funny they were just tiny little balloons and everyone was having a good laugh. Then Michael started getting a little bit too hyper with the throwing of the water balloons and ended up hitting Jessica pretty hard in her face with a balloon. He just laughed even more bc I guess he thought the face she made when it happened was funny and he was just like omg look at your face HAHA! 

It was this point that he ran over to one of our guy friends Jason and pulled down his pants, including his boxers. Jason was obviously very shocked and said ""WTF?""as he pulled up his pants. Michael was just laughing and I guess he felt awkward bc everyone was looking at him. He then ran over to me, knocked my plate out of my hand that had my hot dog on it, and then he pulled my pants down, along with my underwear. 

Everyone was staring and it was dead silent and I was so upset I just ran out of the house once I got my pants back on. It was so embarrassing looking at everyone's faces as they watched it happen. Also, I haven't shaved down there in about a month, and I'm just so embarrassed that everyone saw that :( the worst part is that Jessica's parents were outside too and watched everything happen, and now I'm afraid I won't ever be able to look them in the eye again! Ugh :( 

I spent most of Saturday crying. Michael has called me several times leaving voicemails asking me if I'm okay and saying ""hey don't be upset it was just a joke haha"" and I just feel crushed with embarrassment and disappointment. I was so excited about the bbq and seeing my friends and now I'm worried they are all judging me and making fun of me now behind my back. I called Jessica and apologized to her and she said I had nothing to apologize for and that if I needed to talk to her about anything she was here for me. So I'm glad that that friendship is preserved at least. 

I now have absolutely no idea how to fix this problem with Michael. I am horrible at communication in relationships and I'm afraid I'll start crying. I want to break up. But I feel it's a stupid reason and that I would be throwing away two years over a small thing. I do love him. But I can't take it anymore. 

What do I do ? I

what does finding other attractive in a healthy relationship look like?,"I (F27) think I've been exposed to a lot unhealthy relationship dynamics and i suspect its warped my perception of whats ""ok"". For example I'd witness one partner obviously show interest and sexualize other people in such a way that makes their partner feel uncomfortable. Ie saying other women/men are sexy etc, gawking at strangers, whilst neglecting their partner. I grew up with this, and currently have examples of this around me, and I've also  been on the receiving end of negative comparisons and criticism about my appearance from men and my partners. On my end, I have experienced thinking someone is good looking while in a relationship but definitely did not want to sexualize the person bc I loved my partner. When I was IN love before that, the person I was in love with became so beautiful in my eyes no one else could compare. I think im experiencing self doubt and wonder if this is unbalanced or unrealistic?

I hear many times that finding others attractive/being attracted to others in a relationship is normal and healthy? But because I have NOT experienced a healthy relationship, I have no idea where the realm of reasonability starts or ends but I want to understand. What do u think/experience when ur attracted to someone who is not your partner? Emotionally mature couples of reddit, please enlighten me :)

UPDATE I[27F] feel like I am getting pregnant because it was expensive and my husband[31M] wants children.I'm not sure I want a baby.,"It has been four months since I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38nozk/i27f_feel_like_i_am_getting_pregnant_because_it/), I am not sure anyone would remember it. Boy has a lot happened. If you don't want to read the whole thing here is the short of it: I didn't go through with the in vitro. I went off the drugs and feel a lot better. My husband left me, I felt a lot worse. I left the state and started going to a therapist and four months later I feel optimistic about the future.



Within hours of posting, I went to my husband and told him I didn't think that i could go through with the procedure. He was confused, but I told him all about my thoughts of self harm and doubt about having children. I showed him the post I made and had a good cry. He was supportive and apologized, he said he remembered times i had hinted at things like this but he had brushed it off as hormones. He said we would get me into therapy. I asked him what this would mean for our marriage and he said, ""we will probably get divorced."" I was pretty floored, and you should have seen me try and take it all back- but it was out there.



Over the next week, he talked more and more about divorce and became incredibly cold. I would cry and cry and he would just ignore me. I begged him to go to therapy and he was usually pretty non-committal about it. After a couple of weeks, word got around to my family who suggested I leave him. I wanted to stay and try and work on things, he agreed with my family that I should leave. I went and stayed with my brother who lived nearby, but I was at our house every day,and we sort of just kept acting like nothing was wrong. We'd cuddle, watch TV, have sex, but then I would go away at night. My other brother called me up and told me I could stay with him on the other side of the country, but I wanted to stay because I thought my husband would come around. He didn't, and he told me it would be best if i left the state. I was hesitant, but around this time my husband was refusing the idea of going to therapy. He said he would go with me, but it wouldn't change his mind. I wish I could say I handled this all gracefully, but I spent most of my time sobbing, buying him expensive presents, and trying to convince him that we could make it work. He became more cruel and distant. We filed for divorce and I moved to the opposite coast to live with my other brother and his family. I moved, partially because I thought if my husband missed me he would change his mind.



I continued to be in a lot of denial. I wouldn't tolerate anybody in my family saying anything unkind about my husband and insisted that he would come around. They were all outraged that he left me only months after the miscarriage of our son while I was obviously having a breakdown. My husband tried to maintain a very friendly relationship once I left and I gobbled it up. We texted frequently, played online games together, and I thought perhaps things were getting better. I started frantically pitching ideas for how we could work. Things I would give up, sacrifices I would make, plans for how we could have it all. He wasn't interested. Even though many of my ideas were reasonable and realistic, he just kept saying that he didn't believe we could realistically have kids. By the end of July I could have filled notebooks with my schemes on how we could work out, but then I sort of starting becoming a little bit more angry. I couldn't understand why I was willing to fight, and compromise, and give things up to make things work but he wasn't even open to considering them.  I asked to go no contact and finally started seeing a therapist.



Things still are pretty hard, but they are getting better. I still think about and miss my husband every day, and the no contact thing didn't really stick. I have never felt anything as awful as knowing that he doesn't want me anymore. That being said, as devastating as it is, I don't have any more thoughts of hurting myself. I've also been able to work on figuring out what I want in life. I'm re-enrolled in school for this April to get another bachelors degree, but that is really only backup for some masters programs I am applying to. 



As for having babies, one thing I have realized now that I am further removed from the trauma of my son's  birth, is that I still do want to have children. I don't think my stress was so much caused by the thought of having kids as it was the fear I had of dying. I have always been worried about death by child birth, and several things this year made that feel more like a reality for me. My first step is to get healthy, physically and mentally. When I am down to a normal weight (I got pretty fat, it could take a while) and when I am emotionally ready i would be open to trying to having kids again. If I am never ready emotionally for pregnancy, I am all about adoption. 



It destroys me that this won't be with my husband. He has told me several times in the last few months that his goal is to have kids and that he would give up anything to have a family- including me. I've spent a lot of time being mad that he would do this to me when I need him so much. I'm mad he couldn't wait ant try and work this out together through therapy,  but he can't wait and I know I need to do this at my own pace. He also admitted that if I could never successfully have kids he would probably leave anyway, so I suppose it is better that we go our different ways now- I don't think I could handle the pressure of that ultimatum.



I am confident that one day I will find a man who will have similar goals and not be in too much of a rush to have children and can be enthusiastic about the idea of adoption. Maybe even someone open to being a stay at home dad while I work! Who knows, I am feeling optimistic. I'm down 20lbs, I can get through most days without crying, I'm going to Europe for Christmas, starting school in April, and finalizing my divorce tomorrow. Thanks for the help, reddit. As much as this all hurts, it is better than spending all day thinking about hurting myself feeling like a crazy person. Any further advice anyone has about coping with divorce would be greatly appreciated. 



tl;dr I didn't go through with the in vitro. Husband was unwilling to take the time to work stuff out together in therapy and left me. I moved across the country and starting seeing a therapist. I'm working on getting my life together, getting better, and moving on. Any advice on getting over a divorce you never wanted?

"I [24/f] use to be the ""bro"" until I lost weight, and now all of my guy friends ""fall in love"" with me or just try to hook up with me... I'm not use to this and I don't know how to handle it.","I've been a tomboy my entire life. I was sporty spice when I was younger, I was the father when my friends and I played house. My mother never dressed me up as a little girl so my wardrobe has always been pretty gender neutral. My humor is also not very *ladylike* and pretty much something you'd expect out of a dude. I've had many male friends tell me they see me as ""one of the bros"" because I'm not afraid to point out a nice ass or talk about gross things. Now, I DO have female friends, I'm definitely not one of those ""all my friends are guys"" chicks, my friend circle was pretty equal and I liked it. 

A reason why it was so easy for my male friends to see me as a ""bro"" is that I've been overweight almost my whole life. Once I started my period, I slowly put on weight up until mid 2014. I'm fairly short and was morbidly obese by the time I started losing weight. At my highest weight my BMI was around 42-45. It was bad. I dropped about 100 pounds in a year, which seems drastic, but honestly it was mostly from cutting out soda and fast food. It's amazing what that crap does to your body. By mid 2015 I was 130, with a BMI of about 26. I was still overweight and I wasn't losing weight as fast. It almost seemed like I had plateaud. But in July, I witnessed some fucked up shit that left me with PTSD, on top of worsening the mental illnesses I already had. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I ended up losing a lot more weight due to it. By the end of 2015, I was 100 pounds and had a BMI of 20. However, in reality I was severely underweight because I still had access skin and fat from being well over 200 pounds nearly a year before. 

Right now, I'm happy to say I am healing more and more every day from my trauma event and have managed to maintain a healthy weight (no more fainting or blacking out from going days without eating!) Now my problem is that my guy friends have been ""falling in love"" with me or trying to get me to have sex with them by complimenting the fuck outta me. I'm not use to this attention, considering when I was fat I didn't have many times where guys pursued me. Then when they get to know me and learn about my PTSD, I feel like they view me as a damsel in distress and become more attracted to me and the idea of ""fixing me"" despite me not wanting to be fixed... 

So now I don't have many guy friends because they all become attracted to me. That sounds so conceited to me, but it's true... They like the fact that I'm small(height wise, but now weight wise also), that I'm a ""bro"" and not like most girls(their words, not mine), and that I'm a ""damsel in distress"" so I can basically be a project for them to work on. These are things I've heard from about a dozen guys since I became a normal weight last August. At first it was confusing for me, not being use to the attention, so I ended up leading some of these guys on. I'm naturally friendly with both sexes, so they would take my friendliness as more than it was. When I would reject them with no reason, they would get mad and stop talking to me. When I reject them and explain I'm working through PTSD but would love to stay friends, they would pursue me harder in an attempt to ""fix"" me so friendships don't work. I feel like I lose either way, but since I'm so use to getting along with everyone platonically it is really bumming me out and I don't know how to handle it. I was oblivious to the flirting but I think I've gotten a little better at detecting it, but ultimately I don't know how to maintain friendships with guys anymore. I've lost a lot of great guy friends simply because I didn't want to try a relationship with them. This is such a first world problem but it's seriously bothering me and I'd love advice on how to practically handle adapting to a new life.
   


**tl;dr**: After I lost weight, all my current and new male friends want some sort of intimate relationship with me. I'm also being seen as a ""damsel in distress"" and they want to ""fix"" me. I hate it don't know how to handle these situations.

Advice on being a good partner after having a baby. ,"So my (27f) and my fiancée(37m) have been together for 5 years. We get pregnant right after getting engaged last year and our baby came at the end of March this year. He's been vaping our whole relationship, and I told him after we got pregnant that he needed to quit because I refused to allow him harm our baby by vaping around her and on the stuff she would touch.
Well, she came 4 weeks early and now she's five months old this week and HES STILL VAPING. I do 90% of the housework, 90% of the dog work, 95% of the baby work, and I also work 40 hours a week while watching the baby while I work.

I read more about how bad nicotine is for children and especially babies and told him that he's off baby duty till he quits. This obviously puts even more of a strain on me than before, but it's for our child's health. And now he thinks I'm a bad partner by saying that. And I think he's being selfish and awful by continuing to vape in our house when the baby is there. He walks away from her, but it's still too close for me. He will blow the vapor on her stuff without thinking about it and then says I'm nagging him when I ask him to clean it. 

I have taken so much off of his plate and he still calls me a bad partner.

(Update)- I (37f) want to divorce my husband (40m). But everyone keeps telling me I will die alone if I do so. What is the best course of action?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JYg2PTNn9L

Hello everyone, just wanted to give a quick update. Recently I had my lasik operation done on my eyes. So I wasn’t available to answer all the PMs and comments. I wasn't allowed screentime for 48-72hrs. But thanks to all of you who opened my eyes. I was having some doubts. In my mind I was doing the right thing. But people were telling me I should reconsider. So it created a doubt whether I'm doing the right thing or not. But the comments from people has cleared it. So where are we? That's the discussion I had with my stbx. 

My stbx came to see me during my operation. I never asked him but he still came. He took me home after my operation. Since I wasn’t allowed to do put pressure or dust in eyes it made majority of the chores very difficult to do. But he did all my chores, starting from dusting, cooking and laundry. He was with me reminding me to take my eye drops. It felt good. For once I thought I got my husband back. But I thought about this a lot. He never did anything like this unless I ask him to. He never did my portion of the chores even when I was sick with a flu. He is only doing this to be on my good side. I don’t want someone who only acts nice only to gain something. Plus the messages he shared with his AP stil haunts me. It's been imprinted in my brain. I don't thinl doing 2 days worth of chores will make me forget the humiliation me and my kids went through because of him.

So I sat him down, it easier to talk to him wearing glasses. I told him I'm still going through with the divorce. I am not going to take his kids away from him. He is still their dad. I can never live under the same roof. Even if I take his advice and go to counselling together I would still never be able to let go of the fact that he cheated. Our kids don't deserve parents who resent the other. It's better we part our ways and continue as a coparent. I did suggest counselling as a family so that we can be the best coparent. But as far as being married that's out of the question. He can resent me all he wants but he still has to be there for the kids. He agreed. Although I can see the sadness in his eyes. He said sorry for everything that he has done. He opened up about his affair. That he just thought it would be great. Because we got so stuck in our mundane lives that the affair was an escape. But he didn’t realize what he was losing. He blocked his affair partner and ended his relationship with her. He acknowledges that not only he destroyed his marriage, but also ruined her career. He also stooped so low in his kid's eyes. He also said he will never date again. I told him to not make promises he knows he cannot keep. 

Another problem we are facing now is our kids. My oldest son knows what's happening. Apparently the ruomors has reached his school. The teacher taught my middle child. So she also knows. My son is not talking to his dad. He even refused to eat the meal he cooked and has been living on peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My other kids followed his lead. He refuses to talk to my stbx and it hurts him. I even caught him crying 1-2 times. I can understand what my kids are going through. I don't want them to hate their dad. He is a crappy husband but a great dad. I don't know what to do with them. If you have suggestions please let me know. Also I cannot reply to all the comments because I'm only allowed 30 mins of screentime every 2 hours. But I will read the comments once I'm fully recovered. 

Tldr: had lasik surgery. Had ""the talk"" with my stbx. We are still getting divorce. Kids still hate him.",1712723763.0,ThrowRA-brokenwoman,relationships
"My [25 F] living situation with my partner [30 M] and his son [6 M] is driving me crazy. It's enough to make me consider breaking up, but not sure if I'd be throwing away a good relationship over a temporary problem","My SO and I have been together for about 2.5 years. When we met he was recently divorced and living with his dad. We hit it off. He has a 6yo son, who I met about 6 months in, and who I also have a good relationship with. About a year ago my SO moved in with me in the apartment I was already renting.


It's not a big apartment. It's a studio, with one room for the living/sleeping space, a small separate kitchen and a bathroom. We live in an expensive part of the country and it is all we can currently afford. When SO first moved in with me, he would have his son at either of his parents' house at the weekend (both have largeish houses with guest rooms, outside space and plenty of toys around for all their grandchildren), but after a couple of months he stopped doing that because he didn't like being away from home every weekend.


This means that every weekend the three of us are crammed into our little apartment. There's barely enough storage space for all of our things, and at the weekend there isn't anywhere that I can keep clean and tidy for more than a few minutes. There also isn't a single place in our apartment where I can leave something, like a delicate object or an important bit of paperwork, and know that it's not going to be touched, moved or potentially broken. 


Almost all of the furniture and decorations in our apartment are mine, and I'm a bit protective of them. A few irreplacable items with sentimental value have been broken or ruined by my SO's son in the last year or so, and while I know that they weren't broken maliciously and I mustn't hold a grudge over it, I'm still sad about them and dislike not having a single bit of my own space. 


My bed used to be my sanctuary, and now it's not. My SO's son sleeps on a sofa bed while he's here, but he goes to bed with less fuss if we let him fall asleep in our bed (while we try to keep ourselves quietly entertained in the kitchen), and then my SO carries him over to the sofa bed later in the night. 


My SO also does all of the parenting while his son is here. I'm not trying to establish myself as his kid's stepmother and I don't feel like I have to have a say in any of his parenting decisions or discipline, but at the same time I sometimes feel like I have no say about what's going on in my home. A recent example - SO's son was sitting at our desk playing with some toys. I normally keep my sewing machine, computer etc on top of the desk, but I'd tucked them away underneath the desk to make room. SO's son was swinging his feet and without realising what he was doing, he kept kicking my things. I asked him to be more careful about where he was putting his feet and my SO immediately jumped in and told me that if his son was doing something he shouldn't, then I should tell him and he'd deal with it. I don't want to have a say in discipline if his son is naughty, but I feel like I should have a right to say ""Hey, stop that,"" if I notice his son doing something he shouldn't be. 


My SO's son also doesn't listen to me quite a lot of the time. He is very loud when he plays (screaming and yelling) and we've had complaints from our neighbours about it when it happens early in the morning at the weekend. SO's son often wakes up as early as 6am at the weekend and I usually get before my SO up to make breakfast. If I ask SO's son to keep the noise level down, he either straight up ignores me, says ok but isn't any quieter, or says things like ""But it's morning! I don't have to be quiet!"" That's just one example...


It's also really petty, but sometimes the kid is just mean. I know kids have tantrums, but I think they're probably usually directed at their parents, who know the kid loves them really. I find it hard to deal with them. I'll try to do something nice - like bringing home icecream or making a meal I know is his favourite - and if he's in a bad mood about something else, like being told he's watched too much tv and needs to turn it off by his dad - then he'll say the food's disgusting and refuse to eat it, or that I got the wrong type of ice cream because I'm stupid... When things like that happen my SO laughs it off and says he's just being a kid, but it's not nice to work hard all day at work, then come home and work hard doing housework and making a nice dinner, only to be rewarded with that... 


To put it bluntly, if any of my friends brought their kids into my home and they broke irreplacable things, refused to listen to the things I said (I'm not a nag! Mostly I ask him not to chase my cat, or not to do things that are obviously dangerous), and were ungrateful and occasionally said spiteful things while I was making an effort to do something nice, and the friend wasn't very apologetic and promised to make an effort to get them to behave better next time, I'd tell that person not to bring their kid to my place again. I don't have the feelings of unconditional love that a parent does that make it easy to forgive and forget about that kind of behaviour.


I've started to dread the weekends because I never get to do anything that I would choose to do, I don't have any space to do my own thing while my SO and his son are doing something of their choosing, and I end up spending all weekend every weekend tidying up after them and cooking for them, while getting very little appreciation for it. I'm at my wits end and I'm considering ending the relationship over this, even though I do love my SO and his son very much. 


I'm currently in my final year of grad school and when that's up, if I get a job in my field, we would be able to afford a bigger apartment. So there is an end in sight, it's just months away and I don't know if I can, or should even want to, hold out that long. But at the same I love my SO and I feel like I'd be throwing an otherwise good, 2.5 year relationship away over stress about a temporary living situation if I did break up with him over this. I don't know what to do.



**tl;dr**: My SO and I live together in a studio apartment and have his 6yo son every weekend. The apartment is too small for all of us but it will be months before we can afford anywhere bigger.

I have none of my own space, don't get to do anything of my choosing when my SO's son is here, and also have to deal with my possessions getting broken, tantrums, mess ,etc. I am at the end of my rope and considering ending things over how stressed I am with this living situation, but I don't know whether it would be silly not to hold out until we can afford a bigger apartment - which might solve all of these problems in an otherwise good relationship.",1428851431.0,throwawayfeelinbad,relationships
"Me [26f] with my partner [27f] of 4 years. I'm about to make good on our come to jesus talk over what she thinks is 'just a prank, bro'.","Okay nothing about this doesn't sound dumb as hell. So bear with me. I'm going to try to trim as much of the fat as I possibly can from the backstory.

My girlfriend (We can call her Sarah) and I met when we were room mates during grad school, and have, unfortunately lived together for the full span of our relationship. We work really well as room mates, which seems to have done nothing but contribute to our domestic harmony. We both make decent money and I've been working from home for the past year. She has a 9-5 and I do most of my work when she's at work too, but sometimes deadlines make OT a necessity for me. 

I have my own office and we've pretty much agreed that if I'm working then I need to be left alone. I use noise cancelling headphones so that Sarah can make as much noise as she wants in her own home and the dogs can chase each other around without disrupting me. She texts me sometimes when I'm at work and vice versa, with (what I thought) was the understanding that we respond when we get around to it. 

A couple months ago one of the dogs got out and Sarah, doing some quick thinking, realized that my office has a light switch in the hallway. She flicked it a couple times to get my attention and I helped her find our dog and everything is fine.

Now she does it whenever she needs my attention because it's quicker. 

The problem is that it's seriously unnerving to have the lights flicker on and off when you're deep in thought. This pretty much finishes me for the next hour.

I told her this, and she thinks it's funny that I'm overreacting. Now she does it as a 'prank'. I'll be working, I'll see the lights flicker. I'll come out and ask her what the hell she wants, and she'll say ""I love you!!!"" and dance off.  Or come up with some really asinine request. 

I've tried explaining to her that this doesn't have a lot to do with the lights now, and more to do with the fact that she clearly thinks that she has the right to decide how important my concerns are, and how apparently voicing an issue with her behavior just makes her double down. 

Now she thinks I'm being a super ultra baby over this. I told her that about instance 50 is when this started to wander into breakup territory and she told me that she didn't believe I was immature enough to break up with her over this. 

I've gotten the standard ""ignore it and it goes away"" advice and I've thought of just removing that panel completely, but I don't feel like that addresses my underlying concern that she views ""not doing shit that seriously unnerves me"" as coddling an irrational person. 

Am I completely overreacting here? 
  ---  
  **tl;dr**: My partner thinks it's cute to flip the light switch over and over again while I'm trying to concentrate on work. Asking her to stop has just made her do it more.

My (32F) future stepdaughter (12F) destroyed my wedding dress a week before the wedding. I'm torn between giving her another chance or calling off the whole thing.,"I am beyond frustrated right now and am on the verge of giving my fiancé, Alan (39M) an ultimatum that I really don't want to give.

Alan and I have been dating for about 3 years and have been engaged for a year, with our wedding date in a week. He told me on our first date he was a package deal; his daughter, Rose, is his whole world. I was perfectly okay with it and we started hanging out together. Alan's ex, Carrie (38F) is still in the picture as she and Alan are coparenting. Carrie doesn't like me one bit. Alan told me that he and Carrie had been high school/college sweethearts and she had always held onto hope that he'd come back to her. But Alan also confided in me that Carrie wasn't a great partner. She adores Rose. But she treated Alan badly during their entire relationship. You name it, she did it; emotional abuse, gaslighting, financial abuse, belittling, etc. He finally got the courage to walk away from her when he discovered she was having an affair. Rose was maybe 6 when Alan learned about the affair. Unfortunately, the courts still granted Carrie 50/50 custody, despite the amount of evidence against her.

Rose and I have had a bit of a strained relationship. I understand it, having grown up in a divorced home that both parents remarried. She's a preteen and has some conflicted thoughts about her dad marrying a new woman instead of going back to her mother. But she's been really haughty and nasty to me. She makes cutting comments and will respond with ""You're not my mother"" when I ask her to stop. Alan has tried to set down ground rules but she flippantly tells him that ""OP's not going to last."" I put up with it because I love Alan and, sometimes, Rose behaves herself.

Seriously, she's not a horrible kid. She gets good grades in school, she's in the youth symphony and takes dance classes. She's really popular, bubbly and friendly when she isn't being mean to me. It's like Jekyll and Hyde. Alan and I have talked about it constantly and have even involved Carrie but Carrie just brushes it off, telling me to mind my own beeswax. We have tried therapy, groundings and everything else but nothing works.

That brings us to tonight. A couple of weeks ago, alternations on my wedding dress was finished. I was really excited. My late grandma (who I was really close to) made her own wedding dress after seeing photos of Grace Kelly and many women in our family have worn it to their weddings or have had their own dresses designed after it. As I'm taller than my grandma, I had mine made. It's really special to me. I have the dress saved in my closet, tucked in a garment bag.

Alan and I don't live together. However, my apartment is close to one of Rose's friends so we have an arrangement that on some days Alan has custody, Rose will hang out at her friend's house and then come over for dinner with Alan and me. After we watch a movie or play Nintendo Switch, Alan will take Rose to his place. Today was one of those days. Alan was running late from work and called to let me know. Rose arrived and everything was normal. I stepped into the kitchen to finish preparing dinner, leaving Rose alone.

If I had any inkling of what was about to happen, I would've done something different.

Dinner was ready and I went to get Rose. I passed my bedroom door and something about the way the sliding closet door was positioned made me want to check.

My dress had been cut to pieces with a pair of scissors and was covered with glitter paint.  My veil is torn to shreds. It's completely ruined.

I broke down crying. I was too upset to even be angry. Alan arrived and found me in a mess. He was beyond furious and went to Rose, confronting her about it. Rose admitted it with a shrug of her shoulders and said ""What's the point? She's just a fat old cow anyway."" Alan confiscated her cell phone and immediately called Carrie to discuss a punishment.

I don't know how or why, but this is the straw that is breaking the camel's back. I have gone through so much with Rose. I've tried to be caring and compassionate...and this is my reward?

Now that my sadness has faded away, it's been replaced with a boiling anger. I'm tempted to just call off the wedding and leave Alan to deal with his brat of a daughter. This wasn't an accident. This was on purpose. But then I remember that Rose is part of Alan's life.

I love Alan. But I don't know if I can keep taking it.

What do I do now?

Dad came to my apartment with toys for two young kids. I do not have any kids.,"TLDR: I (25F) do not have kids and have never been married. My Dad (49M) came to my apartment with gifts for two very young kids, and just exploded when I tried to ask what he was talking about. 

Long time lurker, first time posting. I am coming to you, the brains of reddit that always find some angle I never considered, because my Dad did something so wild yesterday and I am spinning myself in circles about it. I'm trying to settle on an answer but nothing really adds up. I'll break it down as thoroughly as I can, but my family has enough drama that it could fill 10 novels so I'll be very to-the-point about it. 

So I will reiterate, AGAIN, that I do not have any kids and am not married. I have never been married, never even moved in with a man. Here are the people I can think of that might be involved in this, somehow. I have one brother (27M) and one sister (22F). Brother is in a longterm relationship with a nice woman but they're both not interested in kids right now. Sister still lives at our Moms house, no kids, no long term partner. My parents are divorced and my mom remarried, Dad stayed single. He lives with my Uncle (40s?M) and Uncle's wife (40s?F). Step-dad is fine, they got married after I was out of the house, sister reports that they're normal and ""beige"" together. He has no kids and has never met my Dad anyways, so his family can be removed from the equation. 

Here's what happened:

I have a shitty, low rent apartment about 45 minutes away from my Dad's house. It's on the third floor, and you have to walk *into* the apartment building and up flights of stairs to reach my door. Yesterday around 6pm my Dad knocks on my apartment door. I wasn't expecting him so when I answered I was confused but pleasantly surprised. I greeted him normally and he gave me a side hug because he had a few toy boxes in his hands. Like Fisher Price toys for really young kids, even babies. I didn't say anything about them because I had no reason to assume they were for me, like I just didn't even register them in my brain. He looked totally normal. He wasn't breathing weird, wasn't sweaty, his pupils weren't huge, nothing was off with him visually. When we hugged I didn't smell anything weird, no alcohol or smoke or anything, but my face wasn't too close to him. 

I said I was happy he dropped by but why is he here? He said he was in the area shopping when saw these toys (which he then held up for me proudly) and wanted to give them to ""the girls"". I said ""Who?"" and he gave me two names I didn't recognize. I remember my brain sorting through the Rolodex of everyone I've ever met in our family terminator style and nobody matched. As I'm standing there trying to match the names to any kids I knew of, he peeks over my shoulder into the apartment and asks if the kids are here or if they're with ""Mike"". Again, who is that? Apparently its my husband. I must have been radiating confusion since now my Dad is looking just as confused as I am, but still keeping up a ""good mood"" kind of vibe. 

I tell him I am not married and have no kids. At first, he insisted I did, and when I reiterated that he just kind of shook his head. At this point I'm getting really concerned. Is my Dad lost? Confused? Is he having some kind of breakdown? I ask my Dad if he knows where he is. He starts to get frustrated *really quickly* and confirms that yes, he knows where he is and who I am. I start to ask him questions that I've seen in movies like ""Do you know what time it is? Or the year?"" and he just gets more and more angry. He starts shouting at me *right in my face*, yelling ""YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?"" and ""ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME LOOK STUPID?"". There's bubbles of spit in the corners of his mouth. He went from 0 - 100 so fast it genuinely kind of scared me and I just retreated a bit into my apartment. When I backed away he took it as a personal offense and started screaming ""OH NOW YOU'RE SCARED? YOU'RE SCARED OF ME? GUESS I'LL JUST FUCK OFF THEN!"" 

He storms off, literally stopping his feet like a child down the hallway. I thought about chasing him but he was so irate that I didn't think it was a smart move. Whole interaction was less than 5 minutes. I closed and locked my door and immediately start making phone calls. Called my Mom, Uncle, and siblings. Nobody has any idea what just happened. I did ask my Mom and sister if *I* was the crazy one and did have children I just forgot about, they confirmed I certainly didn't. Uncle says that Dad left the house around 4pm to run errands in my area, so that part was true. I told him what happened and he said he'd try to figure out what's going on and would call with updates. It's tomorrow morning and I haven't heard anything back. 

I spent all night trying to figure this out. Here are my theories:

- He has another kid somewhere that none of us know about, and that kid is married with two kids. But if thats true, why MY apartment? Did he confuse me with his other, hidden kid? He confirmed he knew where he was so I'm not sure. Did he drive here on autopilot? He'd have to get out of his car and walk all the way up here though, which should have been enough time to snap out of it? The anger might have come from him realizing what he'd done and panicking, but it would have been so easy to make up a lie about what happened. 

- He had some kind of mental breakdown. This was my first thought but he looked and acted so normal. He drove out here and went to a store and purchased items without issue, so he must have been in decently sound mind to do that. Maybe he was somewhere else in his mind? I considered the idea that he was maybe ""in the past"" and thought I was someone else, but again he confirmed where he was and who I was, and I didn't recognize any of the names as anyone in our family. 

- He did this on purpose for some reason. I have no idea why he would do this. Drama? Our whole family loves to stir the pot but this is extreme, and makes *him* look bad which is out of character. If he were to manufacture drama, he'd want to make himself look good, so this would be a drastic switch in his dramatics. Maybe sympathy? Maybe he's going to play this up as some kind of stress breakdown? As far as I know his job doesn't squeeze him too much. He's had the same position for years and was pretty happy with it. The most he complained about was having to work overtime every once and a while. 

- He's developing dementia. I know early onset dementia could be the cause, but he's just barely 50. Yeah he's getting older, but not THAT old, and he's never shown any signs of cognitive failure up until this exact point. This is a huge escalation from nothing. 

If anyone else has any idea what is happening here, please share. Uncle has yet to call me back and my siblings can't get through to my dads phone. I think it's dead. I left a voicemail and texts on my Uncles line but who knows if he's seen them. I don't have any authority in his life, the only one that does is my brother and he lives in another state so it's not like he can help much. What the fuck happened to my Dad???

"My (30M) wife (30F) has developed chronic pain & anxiety, and is disappearing into herself. How do I be a good partner without feeling neglected?","Throwaway account. I love my wife. We've only been together for 2 years, married this year. For context, she is high-functioning autistic and romance/intimacy come less naturally for her than for me. This was initially a struggle but we learned how to communicate and meet each other in the middle, and have enjoyed a really loving relationship. Right before we got engaged, she started to develop chronic pain in her joints and generalized anxiety disorder. I also have GAD so I know how hard this makes everyday life. I hurt for her, knowing how much she has to deal with while also working (and doing very well at) a very difficult job.

Over the last few months, it feels like she's been disappearing into herself. What started as a once or twice a week thing now happens almost daily: home after work or on the weekend, she spends most of her time playing games on her phone or reading, buried in her hoody. She's not interested in me initiating sex, or even non-sexual physical touch, which I offer much more often than sexual touch. We barely talk. If we do have physical contact she breaks it off as soon as possible. Even if she initiates sexual intimacy she makes it clear that it's going to be quick, so it feels rushed and unenthusiastic.
I try to be a good husband. I read books and forums written by women to get their perspectives, am attentive to her needs, do all the cooking and most of the cleaning, do things around the house without her asking, do little and big things to show my love for her, try to see how I can help make her life easier each week so she can focus on work and manage her conditions. I'm starting to feel lonely and unappreciated and I hate it, because I know she loves me.

I've tried communicating how I feel, but always end up feeling so selfish - how can I want to flirt, hug or kiss, have sex, when she's clearly not feeling well? How can I want any more than she gives, when I know it's hard for her to give at all?

I need advice. How do I be a good husband and friend right now without feeling neglected?

My husband's (38M) increasing franticness about having kids is making me (33F) not want them at all,"Married 3 years, 33F and 38M. When we first got together, we were both pretty neutral on the topic of kids, with me leaning more ""no"" and him finding the idea intriguing but not necessary for happiness. We both have fertility issues, so it seemed unlikely to happen anyway unless we made a major effort and got medical treatments.

One year into our marriage, I had a pregnancy scare that turned out to be a late period due to stress rather than an actual pregnancy. During the time I thought I might be pregnant though, something flipped in my husband and he got super excited and thought it would be great to start a family. When my period came, we agreed to ""not try, but not prevent"" - my perspective being that if a baby manages to claw its way here through our fertility issues, then it must be fate or something. But the idea of actively trying and pursuing fertility treatments sounded terrible to me, and I've just never had a desire for parenthood or pregnancy or anything related to kids in general.

Over the course of the past year, my husband has become more and more obsessed with the idea of having kids, and eventually realized he would feel completely unfulfilled and depressed for the rest of his life if it doesn't happen. My feelings haven't changed one bit, but it became clear that we either try to have a kid (whether bio or through adoption) or we part ways.

After much talking, I conceded that it sounded better to be an old person who has a family than an old person who's childfree, and chose to stay with him and give it an ol' college try - with some boundaries upfront that he agreed to. Those being: I don't want to do IVF or anything where I have to take medication or hormones, I need him to promise to start cleaning if we have a kid (he currently does literally no cleaning), and I need our life with a child to also allow me to continue my career, which is my personal source of joy and happiness and fulfillment.

We agreed to give me the rest of this year (2023) to continue building my career and getting some certificates before starting things like intrauterine insemination and going to adoption agencies. This was very important to me, since I've only recently gotten to a point in life where certain career things are possible (better finances allowing for entrepreneurship).

With each day that goes by, my husband is freaking out more and more that we aren't already trying to conceive. He wants to make sure we have a kid in some form before he turns 40. Either incubating in me or coming home from an adoption agency. He says the timeline we have (starting as the new year turns) is the very upper edge of what he's comfortable with, and that he's making a huge sacrifice by giving me the rest of this year before we start pursuing conception. Having a kid is all he can think about and he feels completely preoccupied by it, with the feeling getting worse each day.

A few nights ago, he said that as soon as the new year comes, he wants 100% of our time to go into trying to conceive, researching kid things, researching adoption agencies, going to adoption counselors, etc. - and that he doesn't want to do anything fun whatsoever until I'm either pregnant or we've adopted, because we ""don't deserve fun"" until we have this figured out. We had a few events sprinkled throughout the year we were planning on going to that I consider really good for our relationship (due to the connection/bonding time) and he unilaterally canceled all of them because he wants to focus on conception.

I told him the picture he's painting sounds so awful and stressful that it will probably make it harder to get pregnant, if anything. He said there's no other choice and this is just the way it's going to be until we have a kid.

Nearly all of our fights are over this one topic now, and it's exhausting. He views me as selfish for not wanting to get started right away, is upset that I'm not on the same page as him yet, and has recently even started saying things like, the goals I have (career wise) are meaningless and nothing matters in life except having a child and raising it into a good human. My work is my way of giving back to humanity, and brings me so much fulfillment, to have it be called meaningless by my partner was so hurtful.

Before he started escalating the pressure for all this, I was starting to warm up to the idea in a much bigger way and was even starting to feel some excitement. Now that he's being so pushy with it (and making decisions without involving me in the dialogue - like canceling our plans for next year) I just feel nauseated by the whole thing.

Neither of us want to get divorced; even if we did, he doesn't have enough time to find someone else and reproduce with them in the timeline he's demanding.

I brought up couple's therapy and he's open to it, but from the angle of trying to get me to change my mind so that we can start sooner, rather than him trying to manage his anxiety around his 40th birthday deadline.

How do we find a way for him to calm down enough for me to rekindle my own excitement and turn this into a joyful journey instead of a stressful, fight-filled one?

\-----

TL;DR: My (33F) husband (38M) has baby fever and is putting tons of pressure on us having a kid before he turns 40, which is complicated by the fact that we both have fertility issues. He wants to forgo anything fun and basically abandon the things we do as a couple until we have a kid. I'm getting incredibly stressed by the pressure he's putting on, and it's turning me off to even wanting a kid at all. How do we work through being on such different pages so that we can feel like a team instead of like we're constantly fighting each other?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Wow this blew up! So I definitely haven't been able to answer most of the comments, but I've read every one of them and am extremely grateful for the input, and the time everyone took to give me feedback on the situation. It's given me a ton to think about. I'm realizing this has less to do with prospect of having a child, and more to do with other issues in the relationship that haven't been addressed, and that leave me feeling less than secure on a daily basis. I feel like we really need to focus becoming stronger and on the same page as a couple. Without that level of security in place, I can't even picture having a child. That is a huge block in this whole process (which seems obvious now).

Many people accurately pointed to the reality that I really just don't have a desire for a child, and I'm trying to rewire my feelings in a way that allows my husband and I to still have a future together. I feel a sense of obligation to my husband for things he's done to help me throughout our relationship (especially financially) and as a result, feel like if one of us needs to give up something, it should be me at this point. But that probably isn't true. Especially when the thing being affected is another life. 

I think it's possible I'll want a child in the future, but the state of my life right now just doesn't feel like it has space for it, so the pressure coming from my husband translates to a sense of dread around the whole thing. His ""deadline"" feels like a death sentence I'm slowly marching towards. Nothing about the future feels exciting or joyful, just depressing and stressful.

I'm realizing we need to back way up and focus on our relationship before we can even discuss a child. Which won't be what my husband wants to hear, for sure, and he might not be willing to do, because he thinks things are as good as they need to be between us and me dragging my feet on a child is out of stubbornness or trying to control him. So I have to brace for the possibility that we just aren't looking for the same level of stability in a relationship.

Next step will be going to couple's therapy. I'm a little scared because it might reveal that we really just aren't compatible in the long-term. But obviously how things are going right now is just bringing enormous stress - I get anxiety almost daily around the whole thing, and my relationship is now the biggest source of stress in my life - so something has to change, one way or another.

I'll post an update after we go to therapy (or whatever next thing happens).

I (F28) walked in on my fiance (M34) kissing his coworker (F30).,"I (F28) So we all work together in a hospital, unfortunately.  They are paramedics and have worked together longer than I've been at the hospital. I knew my fiance (Ian) when I was still in medical school about 6 years ago but he moved so our relationship ended. 

I ended up joining the residency program at the same hospital where Ian was working and we ended up reconnecting and after 2.5 years were getting married. We're actually planning to elope as we're not the type to want a massive fuss. 

His colleague (F30) Sam and he had a fling of some sort about 9 months before I returned. But it had finished before I had returned. 

So I decided to drop lunch into him before I started my shift yesterday as they have been slammed working as have we all. I'm stopped by his manager as I walk in, I talk to her, wish her a good shift, and give her an energy bar and she points me in the direction of my soon-to-be husband. 
However when I see him his lips are locked with Sam’s. I left, he ran after me, tried to tell me that he didn't kiss her back, she shocked him, he loves me and can't wait to marry me. 

I really want to believe him but I also have respect for myself and I won't let them make me look stupid. I stayed with my friend last night. Do I trust his word or????

Tl;dr: walked in on fiance kissing his colleague. Do I trust him?

Edit: I've asked her for an explanation. And I'm going back home. He's being very honest and has requested CCTV footage for me to see. Admittedly I've been insecure over Sam before. She doesn't particularly like me but he did look very rigid when the kiss happened. Will update later. 

EDIT: so I went home last night and talked to him. He was very open and let me check his phone, laptop ect. Even showed his GPS history. I did feel a bit overbearing. 
Sam texted me back. She apologized and admitted it was her 100%. She said she had tried to go back to their old flirting ways but Ian wasn't reciprocating. She said she was jealous of me because the relationship we have is so different from whatever they had which was mainly physical. And that she was fed up with hearing about his ‘beautiful, smart, long lost love fiance’ and how lucky he felt that we were able to reconnect. She said that as I'd mentioned in the comments she saw/heard me coming and decided to try and make Ian look bad. She's said that when their manager sees the footage it'll back up her account of what happened. She said she's sorry and that her actions were pathetic and that she'd ask to be reassigned to another paramedic to partner with and that she'd leave us alone but has only asked for Ian not to report her as she would lose her career. He said that it's my choice, if I want him to report her he will. But I'm leaning towards just leaving it be. As long as she keeps her distance I don't want her losing her career. I'm just happy to know that me not immediately jumping to the worst conclusion with Ian was the right choice. 

Also for those saying its fake idk what to say 🤷🏼‍♀️ sorry if you feel like that but it's an anonymous Reddit post I don't have to prove anything. Also for those saying its not how hospitals work…not every country is the US. I won't say which country were from but we're European.

"My husband keeps ruining my birthday, how do I tell him without starting a fight","It is my (41f) birthday. Today. My husband (49m) of 19 years can be an asshole, I don’t need anyone to tell me that. His shitty behavior is few and far between though, most of the time we get along, love each other, sex is great and fairly frequent, he is very unselfish in bed, cleans up around the house, ready to jump in and do whatever needs to get done with the kids. Generally a good husband with some bad qualities. The problem arises when we try to resolve conflict and he is extremely defensive to the point it’s aggressive. Hence my post. Last year on my birthday, I didn’t “tell him clearly enough” what I wanted him to do while we planned the evening, he ended up snapping at me then refusing to speak to me, and I ended up crying-driving myself and our kids to the trampoline park. (That’s where I wanted to go. I love it:) He doesn’t.) This year I was clear- I said I wanted to do the pool or another type adventure park by us, think Dave and Busters but also with a zip line. He said oh no, don’t plan anything, he has a surprise! While I was out running a quick errand with my daughter today, he told me to come home because the surprise was almost there.

It was that he invited my mother over for the day. 

My mother and I aren’t close. She is emotionally cold and distant to the point she can be rude to me, and he knows our relationship is unfulfilling at best and disappointing at worst. She will sometimes just pretend I’m not speaking and start talking to someone else while I am mid sentence. We don’t spend time together, and my husband doesn’t particularly like her either. 

And so far he has spent the day giving us 20 minutes at the table having cake, then he went in our hot tub- alone- now he’s downstairs playing some video games. I am stuck here with my mom who will probably stay until bedtime. I feel like my day is ruined again, I’m seething mad. In all fairness to him, he bought me flowers and several pieces of coach jewelry, even though I don’t wear jewelry which he knows. I feel like he threw money at it, invited my mom to babysit me, so now he can do what he wants. How do I bring this up without causing a raging argument? I feel angry and overlooked, I feel like I was “handled” and then bailed on.  Please give me some blueprint for how to handle this.  ***UPDATE*** We spoke about it today. It began with some shitty defensiveness but calmed down after a few minutes to regroup. His answer to me was that in mentioning to him how good my mom was doing in her grieving process, he interpreted that to mean my relationship with her was doing good. He actually invited my sister and BIL who couldn’t make it at the last minute (she is late in pregnancy and has frequent migraines now), it wasn’t just my mom.  Which makes way more sense to me. I told him I was disappointed, he asked if I wanted to go out Friday to a movie and dinner. I said no, I want to do waterpark.  So he agreed, he’s presently on the website to buy tickets.  I also wanted to address a few of the comments, suggesting that getting along isn’t being happy, and it’s possible I phrased it wrong. We actually have a good time together, it isn’t just non-argumentative, it is good. Like he rubs my back and picks up my prescriptions and notices when I’m stressed and asks if I need an afternoon out. We are horrible at conflict resolution, that’s it. I make his appointments and light the fireplace and make dinner so it’s welcoming when he walks in the door. I am aware that I’m the partner who cares more, it is what it is. He’s presently watching cartoons and painting our daughter’s nails.  My romantic fulfillment isn’t the only thing at play here, and it also isn’t an un-solvable problem.  I appreciate all the responses. Thank you for taking the time to offer support, suggestions, and your own experiences. They were heartfelt and personal, and I don’t take any of that lightly.  

Tl;dr My husband tries to do my birthday his way, somehow escapes the day to do something else, doesn’t listen to what I want and it ends in tears. I want to broach the subject without it seeming like  an attack. ",1711495912.0,Accurate-Swimmer-326,relationships
"I (36f) have had my head in the sand but I've finally realized that my husband (37m) has never been ""into me""","I'm not sure how I ended up in this horrible place in my life but I guess it's because I believed what I wanted to believe rather than what was obviously right in front of me.

&#x200B;

I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say he's 100% my type and I've always been gaga over him. When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate.

&#x200B;

We were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give).

&#x200B;

There were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him.

&#x200B;

We got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me ""*if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually*"". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that.

&#x200B;

We've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all.

&#x200B;

Recently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as ""fat"". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women.

&#x200B;

It just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me.

&#x200B;

He says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.

&#x200B;

I'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not. 

&#x200B;

I'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does ""lust"" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me? 

&#x200B;

I'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly?

Just found out I'm disinherited,"I (35f) just found out that my sibling (41) are cut out of my parent's (70's) will. They have millions and plan on leaving it all to charity. My brother and I both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. 

Let me be clear, we are in regular contact and have a good relationship (maybe not as good as i thought). I'm doing emdr therapy right now for some issues with how my mom has contributed to me feeling like love is conditional based on my weight and appearance. My dad has a history of severe rage episodes that had me constantly on edge. 

Honestly I'm glad they are in a good financial spot as they age and I don't have to worry about having money to help them in their old age. My dad has a family history of dementia and may need to be in a home or require at home nursing care one day. 

However, my mom remarked to my brother that us kids are getting nothing as they plan on leaving millions to charity. That means that over the rest of their lives they plan on hoarding their wealth and not spending it on themselves. I've previously told them i hope they spend their money while they are alive. They do not plan on this apparently. They plan on continuing to live well below their means and having millions left over when they pass. 

I know im not entitled to their money. It's not mine. If they had nothing to give me I'd be okay with having nothing. Recently however they keep bringing up their net worth to me which I've been confused as why. 

I feel like I was never good enough. My parents have said through actions, little digs, and outright ""your father and I are really disappointed in you"" that I'm a failure. Both of us are single without kids. I'm single bc I haven't found my person, not because I'm actively not wanting a relationship. My mom is really disappointed about not having grandchildren. 

I'm hurt and feel like this is going to be their final way of saying we aren't proud of you. I'm happy for them to leave something to charity. But, like, all of it? Millions? 

I really feel like a huge asshole for being hurt over this. 

We are politically on the same side. They aren't super religious and they don't believe I'm going to hell or anything like that. I'm just kinda shocked and confused. 

I dont know how to navigate my feelings about this and would love some outside perspective. On the one hand I feel like they are sending me a hurtful message. On the other hand I don't want to feel disappointed or hurt bc its not my money and I know they don't owe me anything. 

TLDR my parents disinherited me and I don't know if I have a right to feel hurt over it.

Edit: omg I was not expecting this response. Since I don't have a partner I have no one to lean on. I reached out to a longtime friend and she politely put up a boundary that she cannot support me through this bc she has other things going on in her life. I feel like I'm being dumped by everyone I care about so it's nice to get some support even if it's from internet strangers.",1697482483.0,SpaceWhale88,relationships

Even reposting on Tiktok is all about negative things about me. He doesn't even know it's hurting me how he shows people about me when I'm not all that.

"[UPDATE]My [26 F] with my husband [29 M] 1 year, he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, how to make it count?","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dheie/my_26_f_with_my_husband_29_m_1_year_he_has_been/)

Summary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.


Let me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore.

I'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished ""the list"" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you.

A special shout to a few people:
u/mistyranch for courage and sharing 
u/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!)
u/tacofugitive for looking out for me
u/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn
u/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions
u/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping
u/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me
u/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue
u/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year
u/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of
u/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days
u/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure
u/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments
u/daivyjones for the immense support
u/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel
and so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.

Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):
1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.
2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my ""next spouse"" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. 
3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.
4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!
5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.
6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.
7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex
8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. 
9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out. 
10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary
11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.
12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.
13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message 
14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.
15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.
16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his
17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with
   
I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget. 

I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.

In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.

Thank you all once again. 

**tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support

Edit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.

I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good.,"Okay, the title does seem a little one sided. 

Context: My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been dating since last summer. I live alone in an apartment in downtown DC and he lives alone in a house in Annapolis about 40 mins away. Pre-quarantine, we did well will splitting weekends between the two places. Once states closed for COVID, we decided it made most sense for me to temporarily move in/stay with him in the bigger space with a yard for the dogs. 

As you might imagine, it’s had its ups and downs. We were getting a crash course in living together in a space that wasn’t really mine at all, having lots of important conversations, enjoying evenings cooking together and having wine while watching shows together. 

We’ve also been irritable due to drastic changes in our daily routines. I have continued to work full time from home (+ overtime due to an even busier schedule) while he is only working a half day once a week. He is bored. I am stressed with work and finding it difficult to decompress. I am used to/need quiet time to myself to recharge and he likes a noisy household (TVs always on, music on top of that, chattering constantly about sports or draft statistics or things only of interest to him). I’ve tried saying “I’m going upstairs to read” or “I’d just like some quiet time to myself” and it bugs him that I don’t want to do things that he wants. I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn’t fair to him. 

Last night he wanted to watch the NFL draft so I made plans to FaceTime my girlfriends upstairs while he did that. I am used to weekly girls nights and miss them as they’re also my primary support network. I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. After FaceTiming I went down and sat on the sofa with him and said “hey I heard you talking to the dog, I came to hang out, how are *your team’s* picks doing?”. He was irritable and replied “ugh it was quiet until you came down”. I’m feeling like I can’t win. 

Alright; getting to the point now. I hadn’t been to my apartment in over 3 weeks and needed to go check on it (it’s not in a building, it’s in a row house) and pick up prescriptions I couldn’t have transferred. We were originally going to go together but seeing this irritation with each other I suggested I’d just go alone and take a night or so to myself to recharge and come back. 

COVID NOTE: I do not have to interact with anyone to access my apartment. My car already had ample gas. I literally drive from his house to my street, am alone in my apartment. Any exposure to no-contact takeout I would have gotten is the same as if I were there with him. 

This morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn’t want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me. 

Reddit, I just wanted to read in silence, get my medications (anxiety pills), water my plants, sleep in my own bed alone for a night, watch my own trashy TV shows without interruption. And now I think my relationship is over? I’m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up. 

TLDR; boyfriend said if I wanted a night alone I should just take all my stuff from his house and continue to stay alone through the rest of quarantine (no added exposure risk). I’m confused with his all-or-nothing approach. 

So, what do I do from here?

EDIT: wow, this post blew up. THANK YOU for such thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary. I’ve felt really supported and “seen” by a lot of these replies. 
I’m still reading through and responding to comments but wanted to provide a quick update re: some things I keep seeing pop up. 

I am home in my own apartment, alone. He has not contacted me. I spent yesterday drinking wine, cooking, listening to music softly, FaceTiming girlfriends, caring for my plants, and reading a good book. (And checking reddit of course). I am not crying or sad. I feel comfortable and at ease in my space again. 

While bf is not working, he is still being paid his full salary. 

While I am currently working a lot, I normally have a much healthier work-life balance. Some big deadlines happened to coincide with and be exacerbated by the pandemic. it’s only temporary (a few weeks of hellish hustle). I was very clear with my boyfriend before this upswing started, and let him know I was going to be a lot busier and would appreciate his support extra for a couple of weeks until things settled down again. 

Many of you have brought up quality time. I have attempted to express my desire for quality time to him. Things as blunt as “let’s hang out together tonight, what should we do?” Or “We’ve been sort of coexisting, let’s plan to do something together more like quality time.” Perhaps I wasn’t resonating with his communication style. Sometimes it would work and we’d have a nice dinner and watch a show together etc. and other times it would end in frustration and not go anywhere. 

In regards to the mattress thing, I am hearing all your replies about how it just wasn’t important to him so he didn’t want to compromise. It took my having a very dramatic hysterical emotional breakdown after nights of no sleep for him to realize how important it was we find a solution. That breakdown was loud and ugly on my part and not a moment I am proud of. It came after numerous “I’m really not sleeping well, I need more sleep than you do, can we work something out so I’m more comfortable” conversations. 

I am in therapy and understand I am a highly flawed human with dramatic emotional tendencies as well. I do not always communicate well. I consider myself very self-aware and make concerted efforts to require my default actions to create a better life for myself and my loved ones. 

And, finally, you are all not wrong that I have a low bar for thoughtfulness. It’s not really something I’ve ever experienced in a relationship.",1587834947.0,endless_pastability,relationships
BF (38m) refuses to split bills proportional to income with me (33F) despite our big gap in income,"Right now my boyfriend of ten years makes 115k and I make 47k and bills are split evenly except for a $37 discount per week in exchange for one extra hour of housecleaning on my part.

I thought about it and feel it would be better for things to be more proportional so we could live a similar lifestyle. I've been going to food banks to afford rent in Seattle where he insists on living because it gives him access to a high paying tech job and his family and friends are close by (I have no friends and my family lives states away). My monthly rent is $1,600 after the $150/month discount in exchange for cleaning, which is financially irresponsible given my income level. We split the test of the utilities etc. bills right down the middle.

We are already living a different lifestyle - he spends hundreds of dollars on gym memberships each month for instance, which isn't in my budget. 

I asked him as a hypothetical if he would still have me pay for half of bills if he were to make 300k a month and he said yes. He said he would take the extra money and retire before me. He says ""why should I just give you my money"" and justifies this by saying he makes more because he works harder and has a more stressful job. 

What particularly bothered me was recently we moved into an apartment he hated so he insisted on breaking the lease early, one month after moving in, and I told him that although I also didn't like it, I would prefer to stay there because I couldn't afford the extra several thousand dollars of expense to move early. Well he said we had to move because he couldn't take it, but he is having me pay the full half of those costs. 

I'm feeling like he's not being a good partner. It feels like he's treating me like nothing more than a roommate.

My (m44) 2nd born son (m13) is a constant reminder of my wife's (f43) affair and I am growing to resent him for it. Where do I go from here?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  
I'll give you full context before I get into my current situation.  
I am 44m, married to 43f. We were high school sweethearts who stayed together during university and married young. From the beginning I have known my wife is my soulmate and I have never desired any woman other than her.  
Our oldest son is 16. After he was born my wife and I had some marital trouble. Our schedules were off and we struggled with finding time to be intimate and to actually act like husband and wife. During this period I discovered that she had an ongoing affair with a senior work colleague. We separated briefly, but reconciled. Shortly after we reconciled she told me that she was pregnant. I should note at this point that she at first didn't believe she was pregnant as she had ""gotten her period"" during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy.  
Our second baby arrived and as he began to grow I became suspicious of how different he looked to both me and my other son. My wife agreed to a paternity test and - as I thought - the baby was not mine.  
I was broken, but decided that as I deeply loved both my wife and my 2 sons I would do my best to get past this revelation and I sincerely believed for a while that I had. We had a 3rd son a couple of years later and have since lived a happy life together.  
My wife seemed sincerely sorry for her affair, committed to therapy and since then I have had absolutely no reason to doubt her fidelity. Her colleague moved away shortly after their affair ended and they have not been in contact since.  
However, over the years the situation has started to eat away at me for a number of reasons and I'm not sure how much longer I can continue.  
1. It is incredibly clear that the 2nd child is not mine. He looks nothing like me or his brothers. It has never come up in conversation but I do worry that I am a laughing stock in our community  
2. I am a short and slim man, my wife's affair partner was very tall and athletic and the boy has his genes. At age 13 he is already almost as tall as I am. It is very clear that in a couple of years he will tower over me.  
3. Part of me believes that the boy is aware of this, deep-down. He is disobedient and disrespectful at times. Far more so than his brothers are. We had a heated row recently that resulted in him trying to get physical with me before I de-escalated the situation. This is no worry to me currently (he's only 13 after all) but as he grows could cause problems.  
4. He is already taller and stronger than my oldest son. They generally got on quite well growing up, but since starting high school he has started to occasionally bully my oldest son who is an introverted and shy boy.  
5. This may be the most unhinged one, so apologies in advance. The boy is good at everything. He is already among the quickest and strongest in his class, he plays for a few sports teams where he excels. He is a talented musician and regularly appears on Gifted and Talented lists at school. I am regularly told that I should be very proud of ""my son"" and the itch is becoming unbearable.

  
What do I do from here? Where do I go? I honestly feel like these aren't the thoughts of a sane man but at the same time they make sense. I feel tortured on a day-to-day basis by a constant reminder that my wife sought out an affair with a man who is physically superior and more successful than I am. A man who cast her aside and moved on, and now the likelihood is that I am raising his son as my own.  
I feel like I am losing my mind. What can I do from here?  


tl;dr - my wife cheated on me and my 2nd born son is not mine. I have known this for a long time but the fact is starting to eat away at my sanity. ",1702397142.0,Regular-Original-797,relationships
How do I (28f) tell my husband (30m) that I am not a fan of his greasy ponytail without sounding like a jerk?,"When we were dating and for most of our marriage (4 years) he has had short hair. It wasn’t until covid that he started growing it out. 

Now, I actually like his long hair. I love it when he wears it down and it’s clean. The problem is, he never wears it down and despite me trying to show him different things like conditioners and product and how to brush it, he’s never had long hair so he’s not used to the effort it takes to maintain. He doesn’t seem interested in learning, either. He washes it with soap and sometimes goes days without washing it at all, so he transforms from Jason Momoa into Ed from 90 day fiancé really quickly. It’s always tied back into a greasy, stringy ponytail, and he wears it in a high pony which I hate because it makes him look like a cheerleader. He also uses my bright pink scrunchies and bows when we are around the house because it’s convenient, and also because he thinks it’s funny, but I don’t find it attractive at all. I also don’t want to use my brush and my hair ties anymore after he does just because his hair is so nasty. Imagine if Jojo siwa didn’t wash her hair for five days. That’s what I’m married to. 

How do I go about this? I don’t really want to hurt his feelings, but the little hints I’ve been dropping like trying to show him how to take care of his hair have not been working. I’m starting to resent his total lack of effort into his appearance. It’s  one thing to not comb your hair one day or just stay in your pajamas, but his hair is just straight up gross and I cannot take it anymore. 

Tl;dr: husband grew out his hair when covid happened, has no interest in cutting it now that things are opening up, but refuses to take cake of his hair and I think it’s gross. How do you confront a partner about their hygiene and appearance when they let themselves go?

Edit: thanks everyone for your suggestions. I don’t have time to answer everyone individually tonight, but the consensus seems to be that the time for sparing feelings has passed and a blunt conversation is the best way to go. I’m going to reread all your responses and put together what I want to say and give it a go. If it doesn’t go well, then I’ll take the advice of the one redditor who suggested I cut it off while he was sleeping.

Edit #2: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. calm down folks, I’m not going to actually cut his hair while he’s sleeping, that was a joke. I might spray it with dry shampoo though.",1624058076.0,rantstoday,relationships
"My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship","One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.

It's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.

A year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.

Ever since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.

The wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.

I feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.

The trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.

Now when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.

I'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.

I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.

I've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.

I do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.

But I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?

Edit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.

Edit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!

I have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.

Opinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.

In terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.

It does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.

It's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.

I will post an update of what happens, thank you again!

TL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed.",1555181091.0,LadyGrey90,relationships
UPDATE: My (30M) Fiancée (29F) has discovered a new love of cooking and made me her unwilling sous chef,"[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/)

My original post blew up in a way I totally wasn’t expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it’s been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn’t able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could.

There are a few things I’d like to clear up since they kept coming up:

She is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don’t see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that’s been bugging me about this that I hadn’t even realized.

It is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue.

Her motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn’t overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It’s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don’t want kids. So money is not an issue.

So I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn’t want to talk about it. 

I told her that I’m invested in solving this problem and that if we’re unable to do so we can bring it up during couples’ counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so.

This seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she’s overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit.

When she’d gotten past that I didn’t want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things:

* I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she’s making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy. 
* These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:
    * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.
    * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she’s cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen. 
    * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology.

She said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples’ activity. 

I asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up—about how I was behaving or how she feels—and she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later.

That was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room. 

I felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me.

Ultimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night. 

I have started looking to get a couples’ counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate.

My partner (29M) wants to get me (26F) a promise necklace instead of an engagement ring ,"I have been with boyfriend for 4 years now and we have been living together for 3 years and have a pet together. We both have good jobs and hope to a buy a house soon. 

We have talked about engagement and marriage and he always gets defensive when we talk about getting engaged/ engagement rings as he thinks they are pointless. 

When we started dating he said that he wouldn’t wait more than 5 years to propose but now he is changing his tune and keeps saying there is no rush is against engagements all of a sudden. He knows I want to get engaged and married but he is always making excuses.

He is now saying that he wants to get me a diamond necklace (promise necklace). I am starting to feel resentment because I don’t understand why he keeps holding back on proposing. He wants to spend a lot of money on a diamond necklace but doesn’t want to get an engagement ring.
I feel like I am wasting my time and I ask myself why does it need to take him so long to decide if he wants to marry me. He knows I want kids in the next few years. I feel so discouraged now and feel like giving up. 

Appreciate any thoughts/advice


TLDR; My boyfriend of 4 years doesn’t want to propose but wants to get a promise ring even though he knows I want to get engaged. I feel like I am wasting my time because it is taking him long to decide if he wants to marry me. He I don’t want to wait years for a proposal.

I [33F] tried breaking up with my boyfriend [33M] in person yesterday and he turned on me. I still haven’t left him,"I’m kind of in shock right now. I decided yesterday to end my 9 month relationship...we have been arguing constantly recently and it was turning toxic. It had got to the point where my bf said his mom has overheard our arguments and he said she thinks I treat him like shit. (Im not sure if this is entirely true as his mom has always been absolutely lovely to me) Regardless i was so mortified to hear that, embarrassed and ashamed,  so I said that is a prime example of why we shouldn’t be together. He said it didn’t matter what anyone else thinks and he wanted to work through things. In my mind though things had gone too far and we needed to split.

I told him in person yesterday when I was at his house that we needed to break up , that the arguing was too much and it wasn’t good for either of us . Id brought his belongings that he’d left at mine and I tried to be as nice as possible. He turned on me and said “no way, you’re not doing this to me you fucking idiot. How dare you come round here with the intention of breaking up? Are you mental? Are you sick in the head?” He called me the most disgusting names. 

I said I needed to leave and I was sorry but he locked the front door and wouldn’t let me go. It was only us two in the house at the time. I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn’t. Instead he started to interrogate me about the reasons I wanted to leave. Kept wanting to know if I’d met someone else and was I leaving him for another guy. I couldn’t get to my cell phone as it was in my purse out of reach so I couldn’t call anyone for help. Then he changed tactic and said  we can work things out, backtracked on the thing he said about his mom, said he loved me and didn’t want to break up. In order to keep myself safe I kept him sweet and I agreed to stay together; he had calmed right down by then and I felt relieved. 

Long story short I’m still with him. He said he wants to come to see me later and make things up to me. He said he will buy us takeout and we will have a nice evening together. I don’t know why he is so intent on wanting to stay in such an awful relationship. He tells me I’m a complete pain in the ass all the time and how he’s had enough of me so why the hell wont he just let me go.

"I [32M] love my wife [30F] as a person, but she's completely dependent on me and I can no longer handle her as a spouse","I am going to try my best to describe this situation, but I feel like I'm having trouble organizing it.  Please ask clarifying questions if needed.

I have been married to my wife for 8 years.  We've always gotten along spectacularly from a social standpoint.  Unfortunately, she came from a difficult home life, with two abusive parents who she was still living with when we met.  She moved in with me after about 8 months of dating, partially just to escape what she was enduring.  But that was fine - I was starting out a career after college, and having the company was really meaningful to me.

During these first few months, we tried to take steps to get her help and move past her trauma.  She started therapy and we tried to get her on anxiety meds.  At the same time, she was still depending on her parents for medical insurance and her parents began to ""forget"" to provide her meds as a form of control (including important things like inhalers for her asthma).  Due to the trauma and being far behind on life experience due to her parents, she was in no state to work, so we made the decision to get married much earlier than planned so she could be on my health insurance.  It was a small courthouse ceremony, which we were fine with.

We continued getting her care, but I noticed that things never changed.  She would have days where she just felt so off that she couldn't get out of bed.  Other days, she's stuck in the bathroom all day.  Her sleep schedule drifted all over the place.  We would try to go out and do things and she'd have to back out because she felt sick.  There was always something standing in the way of her becoming a functional member of society.

We kept looking into these problems.  Now that she had reliable medical care, she continued to be diagnosed with more and more chronic conditions: as of writing she has been found to have CPTSD, depression, ADHD, PCOS, IBS, AERD, asthma and psoriasis.  The list just kept growing, and it seemed like getting her into a functional state was just impossible.  But she was finding out what was wrong, and attempting treatment.  That was good.  I was willing to be patient with her and help her get better.  I've always made enough money to support both of us.  Overall we live very comfortably.  We hoped to work through the issues, live a quiet life for now, and eventually have more adventures when her conditions were managed.  

But here we are 8 years later and things look almost exactly the same.  Basically her whole life is within the bounds of the house.  She gets up at whatever random hour she wakes up, lays in bed for a while watching videos on her phone, moves to the living room and either plays video games on her computer or lays on the couch and watches Youtube on the TV or reads things online on her phone.  When I'm out there, we'll hang out and talk.  Sometimes we play games or watch videos together.  She'll move between the couch and computer a few times.  Sometimes she's on a voice call with some friends.  Then the day's over whenever she feels tired or sick and she goes back to bed.  That's it - every single day.

She wears the same outfits for days at a time (when she bothers to wear clothes), and showers once a month at most.  I've tried to encourage her to take more but she claims that it takes so much energy out of her to do so and that ""you're not supposed to shower every day anyway"".  Sometimes the burden on her does seem to be true, where she's struggling afterwards due to the heat or whatnot, but I think she doesn't give herself enough credit either.  She definitely was a lot better at the beginning with that - maybe not every day, but most days.  Needless to say, she tends to have a stench.  Of course, if someone is visiting she is able to force herself to take a shower, or uses enough dry shampoo to cover the smell.

She doesn't do chores around the house, even when I have split them up with her and given specific, simple tasks.  For instance, I gave her something small like emptying the garbage cans in the bathrooms when they get full.  Instead she just lets them overflow and claims she forgot.  Or maybe crushing pop cans for recycling - oh... she's too tired to do that.  The only place she cleans is her desk, and only when company is visiting.

The way I interpret her failure to do things, it's like she has become ridiculously risk averse - if there is even the slight possibility she won't be able to complete something, she won't start it.  And when she does start it, that fear of not finishing makes her sick and then fulfills the prophecy.  So she keeps doing less and less and never wants to expand her horizons.

Trying to do things outside the house with her is like pulling teeth.  Medical appointments, she's fine with... but dinner dates?  Best we can do is cheap fast food, and she will probably want to leave as quickly as possible if she's even up to going there in the first place.  Usually, she'd rather I just pick it up in the drive through and bring it home.  Visiting family for holidays is a nightmare.  She's always looking for an excuse not to go, and if we're there I have to keep an eye on her the whole time to make sure she is okay.  She'll constantly text me asking when we're going to leave.  So I end up cutting things short.  I have better family visits when I just go on my own, but then everyone asks why she isn't there.

Regardless of the event, though, I have to prepare her days in advance.  Constant reminders, trying to force her to realign her sleep schedule (and waking her up for things - she refuses to use alarms), making sure she showers.  I can't even get her to take walks - it's too hot, it's too cold, too many bugs, too sunny, you name it.

I've asked her before, what happened to our plans from before?  But now she says she ""isn't really all that interested"" in going out and doing things now.  Neither of us are social butterflies but based on how we talked in the early days, I thought she'd at least want to go on trips with just the two of us.  You know, see some museums, some natural wonders, silly tourist traps, that kind of thing.  Or on a less significant note, just going to local events.  I like having those special moments and sharing them - not all the time, but enough to be significant.  Instead, now my life starts to mirror hers.  I'm always at home, don't go out, just doing crap on the computer all day.  Doing things on my own is an option, and I have, but the sharing of it is a big part of the enjoyment to me.  I only have a few local friends, having moved to this area as an adult for work, and a lot of times they aren't able to do these things with me because, as we get into our 30s, it's stuff they'd rather do with their own partner and/or kids.

The problem is, as long as we're just at home hanging out, having fun, and talking to each other, everything is great, and because we're home a lot it ends up masking some of the issues.  We get along so well in that respect and have a deep comfort with each other to just be ourselves, warts and all.  We very rarely argue, she is never mean to me, and always thankful for what I do.  She always seems well intentioned and while I'm not the best at reading people, she always appears genuine to me.  But I can no longer envision us doing anything more than being at home.  No trips.  No special events.  No accomplishing things together.  Hell, I can barely even picture us cooking dinner together.  Whether it actually is her health, or trauma, or just some kind of internal unwillingness to grow, it's apparent that she isn't growing with me and probably never will.

I know I have unintentionally enabled her this whole time.  It has been the path of least resistance as I navigate the challenges of life and my own personal struggles.  I haven't been able to decisively put my foot down - every time I do I end up backing off.  When I have tried to have discussions about this, it always ends the same way.  She starts sobbing, claims she's ""trying \[her\] best"" and goes mute for days.  So of course I stop trying to fight her - what's the point, I already know how it's going to end.

Obviously, there's a mental health component here.  Maybe the trauma really did break something inside her.  Unfortunately, she seems resistant to treatment.  Not as in she won't get treatment - but that none of the treatments are doing anything.  She's been trying different medications for years now with nothing making her budge, with the exception of finally eliminating most of her trauma nightmares (that's a good thing, of course!).  She goes to therapy, but that doesn't seem to help either.  In fact, once the therapist said that she didn't think she could make any more progress because my wife wasn't taking any action.  That stopped the therapy for a while, but she has recently started going back.  I'm still not seeing any action coming out of it.  I wanted her to try EMDR therapy for her CPTSD, but she thinks it's pseudoscience despite reading plenty of research showing it works.  I can't force her to, she's an adult.

Last year, I noticed my own executive function declining and sought help.  During that time I did a lot of introspection as well.  I suddenly realized just how messed up this all was.  I tried to tell her that I had long term doubts unless we could turn this all around.  It ended exactly as described above.  We ended up trying couples therapy, which brought many good ideas to the table and reminded us of the idea of compromise.  Maybe I can't get everything I want, but she can rise a bit to meet me in the middle.  We tried to better divide chores, try to commit to doing things more often... trying to get her to shower even just once a week.  She ended up reneging on every single thing.  I began to lose the urge to fight again, but the thoughts keep dwelling in my head.  I know that this situation isn't right and isn't what I want.

I've watched my 20s slip away from me with very little to show for it except working day in and day out.  My 30s are starting to look the same, and if that happens, the rest of my life will likely follow the same pattern.  As we get older, I will probably have to care more and more for her, beyond the usual aging concerns, and it will get harder for me.  Is she doing this maliciously?  Taking advantage of my hospitality?  Or, is it just that her mental health is that bad?  If she only actually loves me for being a meal ticket, she sure does a good job acting.  But at the same time, her actions don't match up to her words.

I feel backed into a corner with two options.  1) Keep the status quo and keep slowly trying to help her, as I keep shedding years off my life.  Or, 2) Divorce her, free myself of the burden, and try to start over.  Which sounds ""simple"" enough, but I will likely still carry a great burden - I know she believes there are no options for her outside of this marriage.  She's said before in passing that if it ends (for instance, if I get in an accident and die), she's killing herself, no ifs ands or buts.  I know this is a classic sign of an abusive partner.  I also know that she probably isn't bluffing.  She made attempts before as a teenager, before I met her.  Can I risk that?  I don't want her to die.  And I know that if it's a direct result of my desires, that I will always consider myself responsible.  To me, it would effectively be making a statement that I considered my life to be worth more than hers.

She's also technically right that there's nowhere else to go.  She has no college education, no work experience, no driver's license, no credit history, no local friends, no family she interacts with, and basically no exposure to ""adulting"" so to speak.  There's no other support network than what I provide.  If I leave, and she does stay alive, she has few options.  She can't even go back to her parents - not only are we estranged from them, but I understand that they are now both hospitalized and nearing end of life due to poor lifestyle choices.  I've tried to build a safety net for her just in case, but she just has no interest in it.  Driving - ""I don't have anywhere to go"" or ""I think I'll get distracted and crash, it's too dangerous"".  School, she just refuses to ever go back, says she can't bear to do it again.  There's an excuse for everything.

I came into this leveraging my good position in life to help someone I loved who was in need, but at this point it just feels like my gifts were squandered, maliciously or not.  I set myself on fire to keep her warm, but my wick is just about burned out.  As a friend said, it's like I am taking care of a child.  I still love her, but less as a partner and more as just someone close to me, like a family member (yes, I know a spouse is technically a family member - you know what I mean).  The romance is gone and I can't see her as an equal like this.  If she got better, would the feelings come back?  Maybe, but my hopes are so low they might as well not exist.

Is there any hope left to get her on the path to growth?

If not, what can I do to help her find her footing after me, and avoid having her death on my conscience?

TL;DR: My wife has many illnesses and uses them as an excuse to basically be a NEET and just sit around all day. I think she can do better, but no longer has the willpower to.  I realized I want more in life, but I'm worried if I leave her she will just kill herself.",1726845461.0,Sad-Jellyfish-8215,relationships
[1 Year UPDATE] My girlfriend (F 20) cheated on Me(M 21) with her bestfriend..,"An year ago I posted on his subreddit. \[Link below\][https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d78jqe/my\_girlfriend\_f\_20\_cheated\_on\_mem\_21\_with\_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d78jqe/my_girlfriend_f_20_cheated_on_mem_21_with_her/)

So I wanted to provide an update and thank my fellow redditors. I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around.

Because of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated.

Today I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days.

Edit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys.

Edit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.

"My partner (30M) wants to go on a break with me (30F), and I don't know if it's a good idea.","tl;dr: My partner of 7 years doesn't want to see me anymore. He suggested going on a break. I don't know if it's a good or bad idea. There are pros and cons, but I just don't know which path to choose. I don't want to break up, because I love him, so I want to pick the one with the greatest chance of staying together. 

Long version: We've been together for 7 years.The biggest issue recently is that he hasn't wanted to meet me for 4 weeks. He hasn't felt the need or urgency to do so. What's more difficult is that it appears that we won't celebrate NYE together either, so I'm anticipating we won't see each other for a lot longer than 4 weeks. We speak daily on the phone, but he says he needs his space and alone time. I respect that as a basic human need, but I can't help but feel so forgotten and abandoned, especially while he hangs out with everyone else but me. I wanted to force a meeting, but it felt too pathetic, and unnatural - it has to be of his own volition, and currently, it seems he has no desire to see me.

I told him that I was sad, and that I worry this absence will do some kind of untold damage resulting in both of us checking out. He admitted that he needed alone time, and he confessed that he felt like we were no longer lovers, but best friends. He said that he can't see a future with me anymore, but that he is not ready to let me go as it would be too devastating for him, though he also said he may have no choice soon, as his words were basically a fait accompli. He suggested we go on a break as this might remind ourselves why we're together in the first place.

Cons of a break: It seems to just delay the inevitable. It seems to only treat the symptoms temporarily without curing them. It seems like it's a way to help us adjust and transition to life without each other without it being official. It will just kick the can down the road, but won't address underlying issues. It may also disprove the old adage that ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" - maybe absence just makes you acclimatise easily so that it doesn't sting anymore.

Pros of a break: I have no other options left in my toolkit. Maybe a break will make us appreciate each other more. We have been mostly positive influences on each other. We are indeed best friends and we talk daily on the phone. There will certainly be things we miss.

I don't want to break up, and I would miss him, and I know I would be emotionally unable to have a friendship with him if this ends. His presence has been calming, and a source of emotional stability for me. He's helped me recover from an early traumatic past, and I feel we've both been a compass for each other, leading each other successfully through every storm. Losing him will be like losing this compass. I'll be a lost ship in the night and it'll take me a while to learn how to steer the ship on my own again. Suffice to say that I am devastated, and Christmas won't be the same this year.",1671904755.0,Royal_Opposite_6890,relationships
Update: Not sure if I'm [27] overreacting to bf's [30] joking.,"Original post for anyone interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d864x4/not\_sure\_if\_im\_27\_overreacting\_to\_bfs\_30\_joking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d864x4/not_sure_if_im_27_overreacting_to_bfs_30_joking/)

&#x200B;

I spoke to my bf the day after I responded to a lot of you. I decided I was going to talk to him one more time and set a boundary about these 'jokes' or tell him I wasn't moving in with him and that maybe we need to reevaluate the relationship. I told him I wanted to have a serious discussion and he immediately asked if I wanted to break up with him because he figured it was coming. I was taken back because I didn't expect that reaction. I didn't say anything at first, but then I told him that I wanted to talk to him about his jokes and, honestly, his behavior in general when it comes to people and making fun of them in such a mean way, especially when they ask him to stop. I also did a little reading on verbal abuse and abuse in general and things were a lot more clear. 

So, he listened to me and then told me that he didn't like people trying to ""change him"" and that his last girlfriend had tried to do the same and she couldn't accept him for who he was; he thought I would be different because I was more understanding and fun. I'll admit, that is probably one of my flaws, that I try to understand everyone's position about most things and give them far too many chances, there are exceptions, but for the most part, I will try to understand someone and work with them on it. I asked him if she, his ex, and the overweight friend were the only ones who had left him over this behavior and he told me that he'd lost a lot of friends and dating was hard because women tended to cut out pretty quickly, again, in his words, because people are too sensitive and want him to change how he is. He seemed very stuck on being accepted as he is and angry about people trying to change him. I changed direction and asked him if he actually thought anything was wrong with what he said, I used my experiences, specifically, and told him about how I felt when we were looking at places and he said what he said to the potential landlords. He, of course, said they were jokes and that he'd never think less of me because of how much money I made because he kind of figured I didn't make a lot because of how I tended to do things. I asked him to elaborate and he said how I was always on things like Groupon or using coupons at stores or wanting to go out when places had specials or something and he was never around anyone who needed to do that type of thing. So, I told him that I did think he has a problem with people who earn less and don't live a similar lifestyle to him and that, maybe, he just didn't see it. That, sometimes, we are trying to be ""good"" because we have these thoughts of how we should be on the surface and we try to follow them, but when it's more close to home, our real feelings come out because we're faced with it more and I told him that was okay, but that I didn't think it would work for us, that he might be more comfortable with someone who makes the same amount as him and can contribute how he'd like. He interrupted me and told me he didn't want someone like that because he couldn't be himself around someone obsessed with money and material things (not what I said, btw); that they'd be too concerned with money and he liked me because I wasn't that way. I kind of ignored that, but it kind of told me that he either doesn't want someone who has as much ""power"" in the relationship as he has or he thinks women who want more/expect more of him are gold diggers or someone trying to take advantage in some way, I don't know. Anyway, I continued and told him that even if he felt they were just jokes, they were wearing on me and my self esteem and I couldn't live that way. I also told him that it's natural for people to not want to change when they've been a certain way for a long time and so it seems right to us, but that change can be good; that maybe therapy could be good at helping with that. I told him that it's wonderful to be accepted for who you are, but if who you are is, well, jerk-ish, people are a lot less likely to accept you unless they are also jerks and nothing good can come from a bunch of jerks getting together because they'll be toxic to other people, as well as to each other, and I told him I think he's better than that, that he deserves much better. That any woman he truly loves deserves much better than being verbally abused and made to feel like they aren't his equal or worthy.

He sat there and didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me and sighed a lot. He finally said he was disappointed in me for wanting to abandon him because he thought we were true soulmates and he couldn't believe I was saying such abusive stuff about him. I was shocked he was calling me abusive because I didn't think I was being abusive by telling him why I don't want to continue if this is how he will act and that the way he acts is not, well, good. Maybe I went a little far in saying anything about a future girlfriend, but I guess I wanted to impress on him that, if his friends and partners keep leaving because of this behavior, everyone will keep leaving. The only partners willing to stay will be someone who dishes it just as well as they take it, and he knows he's actually very sensitive and wouldn't like that or it'll be someone who lacks any self esteem and he'll make her feel even worse about herself until she breaks down. Like, I could feel myself getting to that point and that's why I'm so angry and frustrated. Not only with the fact that he was now turning all this around to me being abusive, but that he still didn't really seem to get what I was saying about my feelings; it made me realize, yes, I need to leave this situation and I do feel bad about it because I do feel like I'm abandoning him, but at the same time, it just doesn't seem like my feelings or anyone's, are important to him, so why should I stay with someone who doesn't seem to get that his behavior isn't exactly such that gets people to stay in his life? I realized I probably wasn't going to get to him and the conversation itself had me shaking because I was upset and disappointed, myself. However, looking back, I could see signs that this is who he is, other people's feelings just don't mean a lot to him and doing some soul searching, I realize that I, stupidly, thought he would change over time, but waiting on that is wearing on me and our last conversation tells me that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he does, so it's unlikely he will change. 

He didn't seem interested in saying anything else besides that he was sorry I felt the way I did. I told him that I thought we needed to give up on things and find someone better for ourselves elsewhere. He didn't say anything, so I just left. A few hours later I got a confusing text from him telling me that he ""hadn't seen who I was and that I had abusive tendencies"". I didn't respond and just blocked him on everything. I'm sad things ended the way they did, but it was probably for the best. I'll either be good alone or I'll find someone who I work better with. And I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and sorry if I didn't get back to anyone. I've been quite torn up over this, even though it was my decision. I miss him more as a friend than a partner, but I don't think being friends would work out too well, either, so I'm just leaving it.

"My (41F) husband (43M) is refusing (out of pride) to accept his parents financial help even though both of us are unemployed and in debt. I am honestly not sure what to do, we have a 6 year old kid with medical issues and we cant afford to keep up like this.","My husbands parents have a ton of money. I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing. 

&#x200B;

Last year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this. 

&#x200B;

I mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up. 

&#x200B;

I am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune?

My wife (33F) lied to me (28M) about her age,"TL;DR: My wife and I have been together for 5 years, having recently gotten married and had a baby. Today I found out that my wife is two years older than I had previously been led to believe and was using a misprint on her drivers license as her real age. Looking for help through this situation.

When my wife's family was visiting earlier, we were talking about how long we would wait until we have our next child. I asked my mother in law how long she waited between having children and she said 4 years... My wife corrected her and said, ""no, 6 years"" which I could see my MIL reacted oddly to. Reason being, my brother in law is 37 and so if he's 4 years older than my wife, that would make her 33. After seeing this exchange my heart sank because I knew in my gut that my wife had been lying to me about her age. This is because this event marked the third time in 2 months that I  had encountered information that suggested my wife has been misrepresenting her age.

The first time was in the hospital when my wife was going into labor 2 months ago. On the display of the medical device, it listed her birth year as 1990, and I pointed out to the nurse that the date was incorrect. They said they would need proof in order to change that date, so my wife showed them her old ID (with her maiden name) and the nursing staff was able to make the change. I thought it was weird that the system would have the wrong date, but my wife said her old ID had a clerical error and that was the one that she had registered with the hospital. As I understand it, these errors are rare and can only be corrected by showing two copies of your identification (in this case, passport and birth certificate). For some reason, this stuck with me in my head and I started questioning myself on the subject, but ultimately I decided to believe my wife. After all, I had seen her ID before and it said 1992 and we filled out our marriage license with that date without issue.

The second time was a month ago when my MIL was visiting and talking about when my wife was a baby. Since I was already having questions about my wife's birthday, I asked her, ""and what year was this"" to which she replied, ""1990"". I asked her if she meant 1992 and she said ""oh... yes"". At this point I was on high alert that something was up. I mentioned to my wife after the family had left that it was silly of her mom to forget what year she was born. My wife responded that she didn't know what I was talking about and that she didn't think her mom would have said that. I told her that I definitely heard her mom say that but she told me that I must have misheard her or her mom made a mistake. At this point, I went through my wife's closest friends' Instagram profiles and saw that the majority of them were in their mid thirties, not early thirties. Being overwhelmed by what I was seeing, I convinced myself that I was probably overthinking this whole situation and that the clerical error, her mom forgetting her birth year, and her being the youngest of all of her friends by a bit were unlikely coincidences but not impossible. I stopped short of going through my wife's belongings as that would be a massive invasion of privacy and she would certainly be aware as she is home on maternity leave.

That leads us back to the present and the family discussion about her brother's age gap. Of course, I brought this up with the thought of entertaining my suspicion, but seeing my MIL's reaction to my wife's correction told me everything I needed to know. This was the third insinuation that my wife was born in 1990, and at this point I couldn't deny it any longer. I excused myself for a bathroom break and her family left shortly after I returned downstairs. We cleaned a bit and got the baby changed, and when my wife sat down I said that something was bothering me and we needed to talk. I explained to her that 3 times over the last couple of months, there's been insinuations that my she is 33 years old. She responded that it's because she is.

After some silence, I asked my wife to explain herself and she said that this all traces back to when she got her driver's license in 2018. A clerical error had indeed been made, but one that printed her birth year as 1992 instead of the one on her birth certificate, which is 1990. As a result, she started getting jobs with that identification and for reasons that remain unclear, decided to use that age on her dating profile before we met. At that time, I was 23 and was only looking for matches between the ages of 20 and 26 so I distinctly remember her profile having that age setting, something which she still denies intentionally doing. On our first date, I even remember looking at her license since we got cocktails at dinner and sure enough her birth year indicated that she was 26. I asked her why she would lie about her real age, and she said that she never knew our relationship would get this serious... the longer time went on the bigger this lie became. She said that she has wanted to come clean about it for a long time but she was afraid early on in our relationship that I would have left her if I knew she was 5 years my senior. To be fair, she may be right as this would have been a larger age gap than I would have been comfortable with at 23. She even tried feeling me out at that time asking questions like, ""what would you do if I were even older than I am"" and I had answered basically that we probably wouldn't be dating in that case. For fear of losing me, she let this lie fester, and she said that this lie was in the back of her head during every major milestone we shared together. When I asked her to be my girlfriend, when I asked her to move in with me, when I asked her to marry me, when we got pregnant with our baby, when we got married, when we welcomed our baby into the world... Unknown to me my wife had an inner conflict that our relationship had been built on a lie and each time one of those milestones passed she chose to keep up the act instead of coming clean.

She says now that she feels much better for having finally come clean, but now we're so far down the road I don't know what to do. I don't quite know how I would have reacted in the past to this discovery, and that was before we got married and had a kid together. She's my love and my best friend, but I can't shake the feeling that our relationship was built on a lie. I'm also wondering what else my wife is capable of lying about if she could keep something as foundational as how old she is a secret for so long. In fact, all of her new documentation (license, passport) has her correct birth year on it now since she changed her name, so it was only a matter of time before I found out. My wife said that she recognized this and was getting ready to write me a letter on the subject. She even showed me her draft of this letter in her phone, dated back a month ago after the second event I mentioned earlier. Apparently, her mom had mentioned to her at that time that she needed to get that date ""corrected"", and today reinforced the point that she needed to say something to me after the third event. MIL encouraged her to be positive about the situation and that she is still the same person, regardless of her age.

MIL is right about this part, I do love my wife as a partner and a mother, but I'm struggling with the notion that we would have never met if my wife didn't lie about her age and probably would not have continued our relationship had I found out earlier. Now we have a great family life but it all started and was perpetuated by a lie. I have no idea how we are going talk about this with my family or our friends, as this could seriously impact how they see her. My wife and I both grew up in broken homes and neither of us want to impose that on our children. Part of the reason why my wife claims she didn't tell me the truth is that she was convinced that I would walk out on her and get a divorce. I haven't done that and am instead looking for recommendations on how to navigate this situation. How would you recommend we broach this topic with our friends and family? How can I rebuild my trust in my wife? How can I handle my feelings of betrayal?

UPDATE: I want to thank you all for the feedback, good or bad. One thing I want to emphasize is that I do not care that my wife is 5 years older than me. Sure, there was a time where this would have been an issue for me, but we are well past that. The issue for me is and has been the continued lies and actions to support a mistake that was made a long time ago. I also spoke to my wife again today after gathering my thoughts and considering the advice that's been shared here. I told her that I love her, that I have no interest in divorcing, and that I want to be a husband to her and a father to our child. But I also expressed again how hurt I was by her lying to me and that we were going to have to work together to reach a point where I can trust her. This will take time, but I'm sure we can do it, barring any setbacks. We agreed to meet with a counselor weekly until we feel comfortable and are working this week to resolve our documents that have her errant DOB. We also have no plans on discussing this matter with friends or family unless there is reason to. The one thing we won't do is be deceitful.",1703694803.0,ThrowRA-BigLie,relationships
I can't handle my husband's obesity any more,"EDIT:  Thank you all so far for the responses - I'm struggling to read them all!  I'll try to address some of the reoccurring questions/comments here, but I am trying to get to them individually!

1. The body odour issue is more a change in his personal scent, not a hygiene issue - I'm a *very* scent-driven person, so I noticed the change in probably the last 2, maybe 3 years or so.  He showers every day, and I don't think it's something other people really notice, but me being in close proximity and familiar with his scent it is noticeably awful.

2. Those pointing out depression are right, and I should have added that detail.  He is on an anti-depressant, which helps regulate but it's definitely not a cure-all for mental health.

2. There is definitely a metric shitload of undealt with trauma in his past and significant issues that he's working through - he still struggles with recognizing just how violent his own upbringing was and how it affects his behaviour.  To be fair, he has made some significant behavioural improvements in the last couple years, and even quit smoking (minus a few lapses).  Unfortunately the consequence seems to be that he's gotten worse on a dietary level.

3. He was on Ozempic, it didn't help him and let to a lot of increased gastric issues.  He's been medically cleared of most of the issues one would look for - his sister is a doctor who advocates for him and makes sure he pushes for the tests he needs, he has worked with a gastroenterologist and he's still seeing his physician to try to resolve any issues they can.  I am fully confident that his doctor's have ruled out every horse that could be causing weight gain, they're left with looking for zebras, but again, until he can actually maintain a reasonable caloric intake they cannot truly confirm if he's gaining or holding weight in an abnormal way.

3. We live in a small town - maybe 1,700 people (a step up from the last place where the nearest village was 200!).  There is a big gym here, but it's municipal and they don't have personal trainers and the programs are only month-long one-offs with no consistency.  I would happily pay for one if there was one!  Same issue with dietitians, counselling and psychiatry - the nearest resources are almost an hour and a half drive away.  We are going to have to revisit online counselling, but we have done it in the past and find it a lot more difficult than in-person sessions.  But enough of you have insisted, so you are probably right - even something is better than nothing.

4. To those who suggested counselling - especially couples counselling - I think this is the direction I will try go in order to bring up these issues to him.  The more comments I read the more I recognize  that many of you are right - I *really* need to have this conversation with him, but I think it will be best with a mediator!  I am by no means a perfect individual and I'm worried any conversation about my issues with him will devolved into a counter-attack that I have failings as well that he isn't holding against me.

Again, thank you all for your perspectives.



Sounds awful, but I'm looking for insight on anyone who has experienced this or can provide perspective from his post of view.  I'm at my wits end and it's awful, but I don't know what I can do about it.

I am an average-to-small woman, 5'4"" and 43y.  My husband is 5'10"" 44y and almost 300lbs.  He was fit and athletic when I met him 25 years ago, but has steadily increased his weight the whole time.  We've been married 20 years, have 2 children together.  I love him, and he is a dedicated partner and parent.

The biggest problem right now is ultimately his weight.  It's gotten to a point and for long enough that I am struggling to move past the resentment of him not actively working to lose weight.  He'll try a diet until he cheats, then considers it a failure so gives up completely and goes back to eating too much.  Every time.  He drinks too much (has been a problem before, less so now, but definitely binges).  He'll try to start exercising and will go to the gym regularly for maybe 2 weeks tops, then give up that too.

This has been the pattern for years.  I try to be supportive, encourage without berating, provide healthy food at home, etc.  Fat-shaming is a criticism I want to avoid, but the reality is that this affects MY life, too, and I don't know how to cope any more.

Brutal honesty here: I'm not attracted to him any more.  At ALL.  He carries his weight in an enormous beer belly.  We cannot kiss without me having to bend over it.  I want to cry any time he hugs me because I can barely get my arms around me and certainly cannot put my head against his chest without him bending down awkwardly.  I can't watch him put shoes on, struggle to get out of bed without vivid memories of being 9 months pregnant and how much it sucked doing easy daily things with that belly.

He has severe sleep apnea, which in the last 2 years he has FINALLY begun consistently using his machine for, but even then I have to be on him like he's a child to remind him to put it on or I have to deal with the snoring and choking, which at this point just fills me with rage and resentment.

The reason I can't sleep in the same room as him anymore though, is the smell.  OMG the farts.  When I try to sleep in our room and I walk into the smell of a septic lagoon I want to cry.  And it's *all the time.* Just when I think it's safe and I'm brushing my teeth to get ready for bed I'll hear another thunderous fart.

He has massive gastric issues that he's been to the doctor for, and their only answer is it's due to his obesity.  He has chronic... loose stool, I guess, as it's not diarrhea, but it destroys the toilets and it has come to be referred to as buffalo shits.  I get so angry when I clean the bathroom and just hours later the toilet is completely plastered (that he's incapable of cleaning it up himself is another matter).

Sex is difficult, and ED is now an issue.  The quality is not important - he makes up for performance issues with skill in other ways - but the intimacy has greatly suffered.

People call it fat-shaming to blame health issues on obesity, but literally every medical issue he has would be solved by weight loss.  He did successfully lose 50 lbs 6 or 7 years ago and his sleep apnea magically vanished, only to return when he gained it back.  Even his body odour has changed to rancid.

I didn't mean for this to get so long, but context is needed.  I don't know what to do.  It's all in his hands and it doesn't mean enough to him.  I don't want to leave him because he's fat.  I love him, but I resent the fuck out of him at this point.  I want to sleep with my husband. I want to be able to snuggle up to him.  I want to be able to hug and kiss without being a contortionist.  I want to be able to have meaningful sex again without me being unable to breathe being a legitimate concern.

I've had a glimmer of what his life is like.  Long story short, I went backpacking and ended up on the return journey with a pack more than double the recommended amount more my size.  When I worked it out later, my pack was roughly equivalent to the extra weight he carries every day.  To have even just spent several hours walking and trying to do things under that weight made it so real for me, like needing to pick something up from the ground and seriously considering if it was worth it.  I wanted to cry that he carries that pack every day.  But he won't drop it, he just keeps putting more in.  And I don't want this to be my life until he dies early from it.  I honestly don't know if I could forgive him if his weight kills him.

TLDR: my husband's weight is ruining my life/our marriage and I can't talk about it without being labeled fat-shaming.  If you managed to read this all, I truly thank you.  I appreciate any insight you can provide, good or bad.",1714667397.0,thumpythrowaway567,relationships
UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido,"I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: ""You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring."" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3",1584916178.0,DemiSeren,relationships
the aftermath of being cheated on while pregnant [UPDATE 10 MONTHS LATER],"this is in reference to the only other post on my profile, [which can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15x07hg/the_aftermath_of_being_cheated_on_while_pregnant/)

If you don't want to read the whole post, the synopsis is essentially that my (F28) husband (M28) cheated on me after 8.5 years together while I was 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.

It's now June 11th and my daughter just turned 8 months old. My water broke and I drove myself to the hospital and then labored & gave birth alone. My daughter was born two weeks early only, and she was completely healthy and had no issues. She is doing AMAZING, and the love I have for her is so all encompassing that sometimes I don't even know what to do. She's a great baby, and is so loved by not just myself, but my dad, my brothers, my aunt - she is adored by my whole family, and because we live with my dad, her birth has brought all of us together closer than we've been in a long, *long* time. I absolutely love being her mom.

My ex husband was served divorce papers in February by my dad, who volunteered to be the one to do it, and our divorce was finalized in May !! The way that my feelings for him changed almost in an instant after I had given birth to my daughter was shocking, but it was like as soon as she was born just the thought of this man disgusted me. He visits for about an hour a week, once a week, and has done since she's been born. We have a parenting plan in the works but every time it's drawn up by my lawyer, he finds something else that's wrong with it and choses to not sign. It's been very irritating having to deal with this man who I once loved and now don't recognize, and watch as he pretends on social media that he is an active, attentive father when I've done quite literally everything for this baby and he does the barest minimum he can get away with.

This next part may be very shocking, but the girl he cheated on me with and moved into an apartment with directly from our marital home ended up cheating on him literally within the same week that our divorce finalized and she was kicked out of his place. It took about a year, but he did come back groveling after all, which was absolutely wild to me.

Now for the actual shocking part of this update: I have met a man !! After spending my entire pregnancy alone and heartbroken, I had sworn off men and relationships and then this one just kind of appeared in my life. I have horrible trust issues now, and it's been really, really hard considering the deep betrayal that happened to me last year, but my boyfriend is the most gentle, calm, understanding guy I could have found. We met when my daughter was two months old and he started taking me on little weekend dates for just a couple of hours at a time, and was always very considerate of me having a newborn (which he reassured me several times over that it was not an issue, and he actually has experience working with kids in the past) and then in March we had the conversation and defined the relationship. In these 6 months, he has met my family and has become one of my daughter's favorite people. I've met his brother & sister in law and when his parents come into town later this month, he's introducing me and we're all getting dinner together. I feel lucky to have this man in my life, and a stable father figure for my daughter, and I am really hoping he is actually who he's been showing me he is. Obviously when my ex husband came to apologize and cry for what he'd done to me, I was already very locked in with my boyfriend, but even if I hadn't been the answer would have been NO.

Our house has not yet sold, and I'm kind of losing my mind about it, but there's nothing to really be done to help that matter.

I know this may sound like revenge corn, but I promise it's not !! Karma has just been working hard for me and my little bean \~ my boyfriend dotes on us and makes me believe in love again; he is so handsome and so sweet and the complete opposite of who my ex husband ended up being. I am really hoping he is a good egg, because I accidentally fell in love with him when I didn't mean to, but I do now know that I was strong enough to leave a marriage with a baby on the way so if he ends up screwing me over, I know I'll be strong enough to leave him too. The fact that my ex's affair partner cheated on him absolutely tickles me, to be completely honest. I'm still living with my dad (+ my two dogs & cat that he abandoned me with during my pregnancy) but honestly it could absolutely be worse. My dad helps as much as he can and loves his grandbaby so much, and it's been so sweet watching him turn into this absolute softie of a grandpa.

I don't know if anyone remembers me/my post or if this update is necessary at all but !! Here it is !! I am big time not in love with the guy who cheated on me, left me, and is an absent father to the baby I grew all on my own and raise all on my own. 

TL;DR  
I am a single mother with a gorgeous baby girl and we are both doing really, really well while I watch my cheating ex husband's life slowly fall apart !!


[edit] I'm not sure why this post is not allowing comments anymore, even from myself !! thank you to those of you who left lovely ones, and who messaged me because you couldn't comment lol maybe I'll do an update in a few years if anything needs updating. also, I realize I forgot to say, neither he or his affair partner stayed working at the same business for very long so after I gave birth and no longer needed his insurance, they both were not working there for me to report their relationship. my ex husband did make sure to take paid paternity leave and do nothing paternal with it, but no, I never got to report them to his boss. so long as he stayed technically employed through the end of the year when my own insurance took over, it was more helpful to leave it alone. Anywho, thanks for all the love to me and my baby girl, and the well wishes with my boyfriend !! My reddit experience has been very nice because of all of yall.",1718162070.0,fallingforuanon,relationships
I (30f) thought my husband (34m) were on the same page about kids. ,"Disclaimer, it’s 4am I have been up ruminating since 2am. I’m exhausted emotionally/physically and the following comments are about my real life. Please be kind. 

I am a human! 

I (f30) Need advice… married for a year and some change. We dated 8 years before that and I was very upfront  with now husband (34) two things were absolutes for me. Marriage and kid. Singular. I’m talking this discussion was had like a year into dating. 

I’ve always wanted to be a mother, I’ve worked a good part of my life to ensure that’s i could, I’m financially stable, multiple degrees, and we have a home in one of the greatest suburban areas in our state and I have never been unclear or wavering on the kid front. I would probably have a child on my own if I couldn’t find a partner.

I love my husband. Like annoyingly so. And admittedly I probably look past a lot of things because of this love. Like the negative kid comments. He doesn’t love them. Thinks my nephews are annoying whom I adore. Which, like yeah they can be. Sure. He also struggles with his nephew who has severe autism and is a handful for his sister who is a single mother. Which I also get. He has made comments about it being hard, and that it would be a life changing decision. Yes, I know both of these things. And yeah, I would need a partner who is down to do the hard thing.  But I felt like we talked about it and I was clear no kids, it wouldn’t work and if he doesn’t want kids he doesn’t need to have them. It seemed to me (likely in my mind so maybe I’m just filling in the blank here) that he would have one child but it would be hard and I am nervous. I could work with that. I would probably have 3 kids if I had a partner up for it. But if one was all that was in the cards that was okay with me.

So, we were married in March of 2023 and things have been okay, but a struggle. Marriage is hard. I personally felt a lot of pressure of being married and ensuring I’m a “good” wife and also communication issues we’ve had because he is avoidant and I’m admittedly a yapper!

 We attended therapy and it helped to give us tools for communication and I feel like we grew a lot from it. Therapist was a little wack though… and did say we didn’t need therapy?? And just needed to talk more. Also in therapy we did discuss the issue of kids and again seemed on the table but just a conversation we needed to have about when/logistics/about his concerns. I wanted to do the same honestly. 

Also, another thing I should add that we also live in Texas and politically I’m not loving it, and really would like  to move. He doesn’t want to because he claims I will be miserable without my close friends and family and because of his job here. Which I get, but like… could we have a conversation about it? Plan it? Do we really want to stay here forever?? He has also agreed to moving at some point possibly and has said he would like to live somewhere that aligned with both our political beliefs (he’s very political/left leaning) But he refuses to talk logistics. This will be important later. 

Now to the issue, our last family event he made a comment while drunk that he wanted absolutely no kids. This was… awkward. And the first time he’s said it this way. His sister (also my close friend) snapped at him and said “well you know what you signed up for” to him point blank… because yeah. He kinda did. But I just got quiet and let it pass. It was also in front of both our moms. It was awkward and made me feel terrible. 

On our way home I brought it up and asked pointedly, what’s up with that, and he said he is still on the fence… but that didn’t sound on the fence. Either way I said look you need to figure this out. For real. How about by the end of the year you give me a real/direct answer. Kids or no kids. 

He asked, “well are you going to divorce me if I say no and go have kids with someone else?” And honestly I’m not sure what I would do. But I feel like I at least deserve an answer/all the facts. Like what are we doing here? 

I know having a child is a big life altering decision, I do not want him to do it if he doesn’t want to do it. 

But also  NOT having a child is a big decision in my book too. And I have a time limit unfortunately. I told him this and also explained that I was worried he was waiting out. 

He agreed that it was fair for him to actually give me an answer by then. He is a very slow/thoughtful person I’d like to add. I thought giving him time was a kind thing to do. I could have demanded an answer right then and there but usually he doesn’t do well under pressure/situations like that so I wanted to give him time and space to think. 

Fast forward to last night we got into another discussion, he was upset and kinda rebuffed me and I asked what was going on. I added I’ve noticed he’s been upset for the past few weeks and he admitted the “ultimatum I gave him was stressing him out.” 

I wasn’t trying to give him an ultimatum but I see now I guess that’s what it is. But like.. what am I supposed to do?? Demand an answer? Take his in-answer as an answer and divorce him. I even asked him how he would have preferred for me to handle the situation at hand. He didn’t really have an answer and said I had a fair point overall but he finally admitted he hoped I would have changed my mind about having children… Like what? He also brought up me wanting to move and kind of used it to be like we can’t do both… when would we do both? How? and I agreed, like let’s talk about it. Plan it. It won’t be easy. Neither would be easy. And I added it would especially not  be easy with a partner who didn’t want to do those things so he needed to make some decisions and be upfront.

I’m just not sure what to do from here. Is this it??? Do I just call it. I love him. Maybe I would consider not having kids with him.. but also fear I would resent him for the rest of my life for it. And I wouldn’t want him to resent me for the opposite. 

Anyone been in a similar situation who can give me some insight. I’m just so lost. Sad. Angry. All the feels. 

TLDR: I thought husband and I were on the same page about kids, told him early on I’ve always wanted to be a mother, a year plus into marriage he’s on the fence and won’t give me an answer. What should I do? 

Update: True to r/relationship fashion majority of you told me to hit the road lol. But as of right now, I will be staying with husband and we are going to try to work through this and figure out what works for both of us. I'm waiting for his final answer so I can make my final choice too. 

He did admit he is anxious about the amount of responsibility a child will be and overall he's scared. But he also said he would regret not having children either and that we needed to talk out the logistics. He also said he has been trying to activly imagine himself being a dad and embrace it. Which I think is what he needed to do. He's slow in nature and methodical and I love that about him. We make a good team because I am a get your hands dirty and jump in kinda gal and he makes me slow down and think first.

We have had lots of conversations around the topic lately and I think that is mostly what we needed to do.

I really appreciate all the kind words and hope this post will help someone else in my situation.

"I've (m24) been with my partner (f23) for 4 years, but now work on the other side of the planet 60% of the time. She understands the reasons (I make very good money), but after 12 months of doing this, she's told me to quit my job.","Long ass back story (or skip to TL;DR)

So we've been together for about 4 years now. We met at university, we've both had a bunch of short- and long(ish)-term relationships beforehand, and things just went perfectly.


We're both from, and studied in, the UK.


Before I graduated, I was (almost out of the blue, but from a very legitimate source) offered a very well-paying job ($80k) as a software engineer in the US. The deal was for me to spend 2 months in the US, then I would work remotely from the UK, and visit the US for a few weeks at a time, a few times a year. Initially the idea of spending 2 months away from her sounded like hell, but we both saw that with the UK's economy in the state it was (and still is) in, it was a pretty damn good deal.


We were living together in an apartment that (with a little help from my father) we'd bought, and had just moved in when I had to leave for the US.


After the 2 months, and a Christmas break, I was offered a raise (to $100k); in exchange for another 6 weeks in the US, but this time they'd pay for her to come along for the ride too. She was still studying at that point, so came along, but only for 3 weeks.


After that, we lived together very happily for about 4 months. Then one day, I was offered another raise. To $140k. But from then on I'd have to spend at least half my time in the US. It took some time for it to sink in to both of us what was on the cards; trading a very nice cohabiting situation, for a part-time long-distance thing. There's obviously a whole debate on that itself, but in the end, we decided that I should take it.


We came to the agreement that I'd spend 6 weeks in the US, then 3-4 weeks in the UK. And just roll with that. She came over and chilled for 3 months in the summer after she graduated; we travelled the US, went to Canada, and had two very luxurious weeks in Hawaii. 


She'd graduated with a degree in crime / law, and through a contact of my boss's, got [legal gray area] an internship with a private investigator[/legal gray area]. After a month of that, he wanted to employ her full time, and sponsor her for a visa. If you're unfamiliar with the US visa system -- from an outsiders point of view, even those with higher education qualifications (I have a Masters degree, and I barely got in) it's one of the worst systems going. She's basically ineligible, because the US decided that the number of years spent in education outweighs the globally standardized levels of certification. An undergraduate degree in the US is 4 years, but in plenty of other places it's 3. We were told she's not even eligible to apply. Go back to school and get a Masters degree, or 3 years progressive work experience. 


She can stay in the US for as long as I'm there -- we're not married but there is a non-working visa for long-term cohabiting partners of people who have a working visa, and we have enough proof of that (proof of our joint mortgage is enough). But for her, it would likely suck, because she cannot work.


Since then, she's been back in the UK, and I've been travelling to and from my office and her. It's not easy, on either of us. But we've had enough long, hard conversations about it, and decided that we should give it a year, and reassess things. I work for a startup company. There's a fair chance that my job won't even exist in 12 months time. My visa allows me to transfer to another company, but it might be hard to find one that's quite so lenient on me disappearing from the office every 6 weeks. So I'd probably come home.


But if my job does exist in 12 months, then it means were doing well. I'm on track to have a raise and a bonus that would put me at $180-200k for this year; not including the fairly significant number of company stocks I own.


The trouble is; as much as we both see the upside to this, it really isn't easy on our relationship. She recently got a decent job in the UK, with some good prospects for advancing, and pays about $30k. We both work long hours (both our jobs expect at least 50 hours per week, and I've worked both days of the weekend for weeks in a row in the past), and with an 8 hour time difference, communicating isn't easy. We email each other from when I wake up to when she goes to sleep, but a phone call during the week probably only happens 2-3 times, for 30 minutes, when I get chance to take a break from working.


At the weekend, we Skype for about 3 hours each day, unless she's got plans otherwise (it's morning in the US, so I'm always available). When I'm back in the UK, things are usually excellent. At the weekend, we'll drive to another city for a couple of nights, or get a cheap flight to somewhere in Europe that we've never been. But a few weeks in, and I have to leave again.


I've come to the conclusion in my mind, that this is the situation we're in. I think it's far from perfect, but considering not many people are as fortunate as I've been, I think it would be wise to ride it out. Keep collecting the pay checks until I have to come home, or if the company survives the year, stick it out and get a pretty big payout in the end. I try and remove as many negative thoughts about how this is affecting our relationship as possible; not because I don't care (which is what she thinks I do it for), but because thinking like that is going to do nothing but make both of us feel bad.


She's very good at hiding her feelings, and will one day sit down and talk over all this, we'll agree on things, and move on. But then a few weeks later, she'll burst out into tears and anger at how I've escaped across the world. This is usually after she hangs out with her ""friends"" (right now, people she's been working with for about a month, have never met me, and don't really know her) that just make her feel stupid; by making out that she's some sort of idiot for putting up with me. ""My boyfriend would never, *EVER*, do that to me!"".


Last night, was the first time we've had an argument about this situation while I haven't been over in the US. Usually it comes after I've been gone for about 4 weeks, and one of us gets too busy that we don't get chance to speak for a few days. We talk it over, and then we're fine again. She's always said that she doesn't want this to go on for longer than a year, but this was the first time she said ""if you're still over there in 12 months, I'll have to leave you"".


My long-term friends, are all just mostly jealous because they know I make more money than they do (though they actually think it's quite a bit less than it really is), and think my girlfriend is ""so lucky"".


Her long-term friends, are generally very supportive.


Both our families are supportive, but hers have suggested to her in private that I should probably quit my job and come home. Though they don't know all the details, and aren't really aware that I'm not going to be able to get a job of this caliber in the UK.


**TL;DR
I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years, I took a job that requires me to spend 60% of my time on the other side of the world, about 18 months ago. I make a truckload of money, enough to support both of us comfortably, but if she joins me she'll have to quit her job, and won't be able to work.**


Has anyone else that's been in a situation like this got any advice/experience to share?


Was I just a massive cock for taking the job in the first place?


Am I the greedy, immoral slime ball that her co-workers think I am?


Is it unreasonable of me to want to make (a lot) of money while I can?


If you were me, would you have taken the job?


If you were me, would you quit my job?


If you were her, would you move to the US knowing you couldn't work (the deal includes a puppy of your choice, and 5 minutes walking distance to the beach)?


If you were her, would you just leave me now, because it's already been long enough?


What the hell can I say to her that I haven't already?",1363958816.0,throwaway75329,relationships
Update: I (28M) messed up by asking my girlfriend (26F) to stop talking about her late boyfriend," [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n9q8k4/i_28m_messed_up_by_asking_my_girlfriend_26f_to/)

  
All the comments here helped me understand that we needed to talk about the issue but she was still a bit mad at me. I thought I should just give her space for a few days. I think a day or two after It was announced that I was being promoted. Some of  my colleagues hosted a little after work dinner for me as I would be moving divisions and not working with them anymore. It was nice and It really touched me and it also made me understand how fucked our relationship had become. I got what the comments meant but I guess actually having a nice dinner celebrating my success felt great and made me truly understand how unhappy I felt. 

we had the talk a few days later. I told her that I felt unhappy and unappreciated. That I felt like I needed some time away from her. She almost seemed like she was waiting for this. she didn't seem particularly upset over it. She said she understood and she would move back to her parents as soon as possible. I know it is ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. some proof that she cared for me? I don't know. I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her. 

She moved out two weeks ago and I miss her a lot. Home feels really lonely without her but at the same time I feel better. Not a lot but I feel a bit better about myself. It is strange. 

She is not a bad person. she is a wonderful person and that is why I fell in love with her but the closer we got the less happy our relationship made me. I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.

how to be a good partner when i have autism,"I (18n/a) am getting really close to someone (20f) and we might start dating in the near future. I have autism. I'm really bad at naming and regulating my emotions, so sometimes I get really upset. this person is one of my closest friends so I turn to them a lot of the time for help. I do have a therapist but I only see him once every 2 weeks. sometimes when I get overwhelmed or overstimulated I do this thing I call ""scary mode"" where I get like almost animalistic, and can lash out in fear. usually I try to keep the rage and anger inwards, so I just like hit my head or my hand really hard on something until I calm down. but now I'm scared that if I get close to this person, I'll accidentally hurt them. and not just because of scary mode. I also have intense mood swings and really need support and reassurance during them. when I calm down I always feel so bad and apologize and let whoever I turned to for help know how much I appreciate them, but I'm scared of that too. when does apologizing for my behavior and thanking them turn into manipulation? in my life those lines have always been very blurred so I have trouble seeing the clear divide in my actions.

My (30M) Fiancée (29F) has discovered a new love of cooking and made me her unwilling sous chef,"So, my fiancée has taken up cooking during quarantine. Previously, we did not cook much and instead ate out a lot. We could afford it and are generally healthy eaters. Of course, we both CAN cook but given how busy we are it was easier to eat out. Also to be honest, I don't really enjoy cooking and see it as a chore to be avoided. I love food but there are other things I'd rather do with my time.

Due to quarantine, my fiancée has decided to actually cook more and she has found she really enjoys it. This is great! I'm happy for her that she's discovered a new thing that brings her joy. Turns out she's also quite good at it and cares about learning new skills, etc., so I've been benefiting as well.

I still don't really care to cook myself like I said, so in return for her putting all this effort into cooking I've been helping out by paying for take out on nights she doesn't want to cook as well as doing all the dishes and cleaning the counters, etc. for the days when she does cook. As far as I was aware she agreed that this was a suitable compromise, and of course if she felt it was unfair I would have been happy to pick up the slack in other ways. But she seemed to be happy with this.

As her cooking experiments expanded to baking and generally became more elaborate, she started to rope me into cooking. I'd head to the kitchen to get a drink and check on her and she'd be like, ""oh can you help me chop this while I saute this..."" or something. I would chop some carrots for her or whatever and chat with her about the meal and then head back to whatever I was doing. I didn't mind this at all.

But it has slowly grown into me becoming her sous chef, especially when she wants to make meals that are really easier with two people. Keep in mind her cooking experiments are elaborate and sometimes take two or more hours. So my entire evening is gone to these cooking endeavors and this happens multiple times a week. On top of that, she tends to order me around in the kitchen and can be a little rude. 

As you can probably predict we had a fight about it. I told her that I dislike her attitude in the kitchen when I help, and I don't like cooking to begin with. I would feel better about helping her if she wasn't so rude to me. But quite frankly, I don't want to spend 8+ hours every week cooking. It is not MY hobby, it's hers. If she wanted me to pitch in by providing meals, I would buy them or make something simple. 

She was very upset. She said that it wasn't fair that I was enjoying the fruits of her labor but not contributing, and that cooking took 2 hours but doing the dishes/cleaning only took half an hour. I told her that it was her decision to make very elaborate meals and that I would be happy if she put together a simple pizza or stir fry. After a certain point, the elaborateness of her meals crosses into hobby territory and I resent being made to feel like I'm a bad partner because I don't want to give up multiple evenings to HER hobby.

We did not really resolve this. I actually bought/made some of my own meals on a few nights so I wasn't ""enjoying the fruits of her labor"" but this seemed to make her more upset and our fridge started to fill with more leftovers than she could eat herself. Another time I ended up helping her but told her I needed to go to a videochat at 8 pm, and she got upset when I actually stopped helping to leave even though I'd told her beforehand. I told her a little snappishly, I'm afraid, that I wasn't her sous chef to boss around in the kitchen.

I tried to discuss this with her again when we were feeling calmer. I told her that I loved that she found a new hobby but it is HER hobby and I can't help with it and don't want to feel obligated to do so. She retorted that it wasn't feminist of me to relegate the cooking to her and benefit from it without helping. The feminism connection makes little sense to me because previously neither of us cooked much and she chose to take up cooking herself, but of course I didn't tell her that. I told her that if she wants to discuss the distribution of labor in our house we can do so and come up with something new that reflects that she's cooking more now. 

We tried to do this but she wanted to count ALL the time she spends cooking as ""chore time."" So according to her ideal chore distribution, she spends 10+ hours cooking DINNER ONLY every week, which somehow leaves me with pretty much all the rest of the chores. I told her I wasn't happy with this, because making elaborate meals is a hobby. It isn't fair that say, 6/10 hours of her ""chores"" is actually her hobby, and I have to do an equivalent amount of actual chores, if that makes sense.

So we're at a bit of an impasse. Am I actually being a bad feminist? I don't think I am wrong (I am quite familiar with emotional labor, mental load, all that) but maybe I am. I love this woman and obviously want to marry her but we're usually good at making decisions logically and this is the first time we've had such a disagreement. I don't know how to get her to understand the boundary between cooking as a necessary activity and cooking as a hobby. I would appreciate your advice.

"[UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.","[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt ""forced"" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.",1530472095.0,whiskeyteafoxtrot,relationships
UPDATE: Girlfriend (F28) lied and went to an event I wanted to go to without me (M30) and I don't know what to do,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f1uqyv/girlfriend_f28_lied_and_went_to_an_event_i_wanted/

I wanted to thank everyone for their input on my last post, I know it’s a bit cliche but I wasn’t expecting it to take off so much. Even the harsher comments helped me get a better grasp on the situation. I wasn’t going to bother posting an update, but a few people have messaged me (and someone stole/reposted on r/amioverreacting), so I figured I’d finally write this out. Spoiler, not a good ending. TLDR at the bottom, it’s a long one. 

I spent a lot of time thinking about what to do. I made my post on Monday, we had a date planned for Wednesday. I decided I would bring it up then.

On Tuesday she was having a bad day at work, but she didn’t really let me know. She texted me about an email that her asshole boss sent her, and I thought my response was appropriately supportive and validating (basically telling the guy off and letting her know she’s right to be frustrated). I get a curt “Is that all you took from that?” back from her. I probably should have thought a bit more, but I was dealing with my own work issues and a migraine, so I lazily just doubled down on my first response (again reiterating that she has every right to be angry.) She didn’t respond. I didn’t double text, but I did reach out via snapchat and instagram messages to see if she’d respond there. She didn’t open any of my messages. Because I’m always trying to make excuses for her, I assumed she’s busy and will respond when she has time. 

If you couldn’t tell from the first post, my girlfriend really struggles with communication. Finally 4 hours later she responds with how she doesn’t feel emotionally supported and she needs some space to think about the future of our relationship. I was super confused and asked what was wrong. I got the response “I just had a really crappy day and you didn’t even bother to call me”. 

I kind of snapped at that a little. I asked why she didn’t respond to any of my messages, or why didn’t she say “Hey, I had I really bad day at work and need to hear your voice” or something like that? I pointed out that she never asks me for emotional support, she just acts out until I figure out what she needs or until she gets frustrated and gives me the silent treatment. “I didn’t respond because it wouldn’t have mattered, I cannot always be the one putting in the work”. 

I explained for what felt like the thousandth time that I can’t read her mind, she needs to communicate her needs. She’s intentionally avoiding work by refusing to open up and asking for help. I understand that’s hard for her, but I can’t make up for that on my end. I pointed out that I didn’t realize she was having an awful day, I just thought she was dealing with regular work bullshit. She never tried to clarify how she was feeling or what she needed. “I’ve been saying I need more effort from you for months and nothing has changed. This is the exact argument I didn’t want to have, and you pushed it.” I responded that I desperately want to support her, but she isn’t giving me anything to work with. I gave her the space she asked for and told her I love her. 

The next morning she asks if she can come over after work to talk. After I confirm, she goes back to giving me the silent treatment. I soon found myself blocked on snapchat and instagram.  Weirdly enough it was this that finally made it click for me about how bad I’d been treated. I was so starved for emotional and non-sexual physical intimacy (she doesn’t even like holding hands, let alone cuddling) and was an anxious mess from constantly walking on egg shells. But I’m stubborn, I loved her, I really wanted things to work and was still wanting to talk things out (she’s pulled a similar stunt before and we ended up staying together). 

She finally comes over. We start out going over our communication issues. Her big thing is that she feels that with a compatible partner everything should come naturally, including knowing when your partner needs something without asking. She can get overwhelmed and just shuts down, and asking for help is also very overwhelming for her (goes against her need to feel independent and self sufficient, and feeds her fear of getting into a toxic codependent relationship like her parents). So she feels that this is an appropriate expectation to have. I explain that she’s asking me to read her mind, that she’s putting all of the emotional labor on me, and that isn’t a realistic or fair expectation to have.

She started to change the subject, which is a go-to of her’s when she’s uncomfortable with a conversation. We jumped around to various issues in our relationship. She randomly says that she doesn’t feel like she really knows me. I ask her what she means by that… she says that she never knows what I’m thinking or feeling and I’m too closed off (all false, and this definitely feels like projection on her part). It also hit on a deep insecurity that she didn’t actually care enough about me to try to get to know me. She barely engaged in my interests and hobbies, rarely asked me questions about myself (if she did, they were usually negative questions). On the other hand, I made all the effort to know about the things she cared for. 

She then brought up that we’ve been dating for a year, but have no plans to move in together. Again, this hit on a major insecurity of mine. I had been trying to bring this up for months, I straight up asked her when she was having issues at her place and she was thinking about moving (this was late July around our one year anniversary). On the other hand, she gave me different answers every time I asked her what she wanted for her our our future (if she didn’t try to  change the subject instead). She’s never brought up our future on her own, I always was the one to bring it up. I made it clear that the only reason we don’t have future plans is because she doesn’t seem to want to make them yet. I also said there is nothing wrong with that, but she needs to let me know if she’s not ready for that step.

Pointing all of this out to her made her go quiet. Not silent treatment quiet, but when things get too intense for her she just starts to shut down and withdraw. It took a few minutes for her to come out of it. As she did, I explained that I felt that I was the only one really putting effort into our relationship. 

She asked me what I seriously wanted. I began in a kind of roundabout way I guess. I explained that 6 years ago, I had to end an engagement to to my fiancé after she became an abusive alcoholic, then spent the next few years working 80+ hours a week at a job I hated while watching my dad slowly die. (All thing she already knows) What I was going to say next is that after going through that, I wanted to get a job that was better for my mental health (succeeded!) and I wanted to find my person. Instead, I got cut off. She said that maybe I started dating too soon after my dad’s passing (we started dating about 9 months later). This really threw me off, took me a minute to recover. 

Before I could continue, she said that she just doesn’t feel our communication styles are compatible. I asked her if she seriously thinks she has good communication skills, which she said feels like she does. 

I finally brought up the show. I said that I know that she went without me and I explained how I know (and my justification for looking up her location). This visibly shocked her, and she shut down again. I asked why she lied to me, twice? No answer. I asked if she was cheating on me? No, she went with her college friends. She eventually confirmed that this was planned before I even asked to go. As I suspected, she just said that she didn’t want to go to avoid what she felt was an uncomfortable conversation. I asked her if she felt like this was okay? Yes, she was worried that if she told the truth I’d push her to let me go with them. 

I asked if I’ve ever tried to pressure her into doing something that she didn’t want to do? Yes, I ask to watch movies that she doesn’t like over and over. Again, a sore spot. I rarely got to pick what we watched, and she seems to intentionally avoid movies that are important to me. Over Christmas I asked to watch Home Alone to continue a tradition I had with my dad. I wanted her to be there with me for support… she refused and found every way to invalidate my feelings. Have I ever pressured her outside of asking to watch a few of my favorite movies? No. 

I asked if I had done anything to make her feel unsafe opening up to me about any of this? No, she’s just not the type to open up like that to anyone but her sister. How does she expect to have a serious relationship with someone if she won’t open up to them? She feels like the right person will just make it easy for her. Does she feel like she needs to do any work on herself to be a better partner? No, because she doesn’t really want to be a partner anymore. She said that our relationship was adding so much stress in her life, to the point that it was affecting her job and eating disorder recovery (I’m not sure how true this is, she’s been doing really well with both). Where is the stress coming from in our relationship for her? The constant obligations and me constantly asking for more from her. 

I brought up how much work I’ve put into this relationship. I chauffeured her around for 2 months while her car was in the shop, visited her in the hospital every day and then slept on her couch and took care of her for a week while she recovered from surgery, I’ve paid for the vast majority of dates, given her money when she overdrew her bank account, helped her move on short notice, and how I’ve always showed up for her when she’s asked (and plenty of times when she didn’t). I’ve also tried to model good relationship behavior, and how exhausting and heartbreaking it is to not have that effort reciprocated. Instead, I rarely got to plan dates or pick what movies/shows we watched due to her refusal to compromise. I put in all of this effort trying to open up to her, and to get her to open up to me. The few times I asked for her emotional support, even on small things like watching Home Alone with me, she refused. She didn’t take any interest in my hobbies, even those that we had in common. We had next to no emotional intimacy. And I had to constantly forgive her for blowing up at me for little things, giving me the silent treatment, or lying to me, while I always admitted when I was wrong and showed her that I was putting in the work to grow with our relationship. I’ve been giving so much without getting anything in return, and I didn’t feel like my expectations were unrealistic at all. I was asking for the bare minimum. My needs weren’t being met. 

She again just said that she doesn’t think our communication styles are compatible. I guess this is the hill she wanted to die on to end our relationship. I did let her know that I didn’t want to end things and I was still willing to work on us. I offered to get us a relationship counselor, but she refused. She was exhausted and couldn’t do this anymore. At this point I was exhausted too, and agreed to end things. She never cried or anything during the whole conversation, she just switched between being cold or looking uncomfortable. By the end I was kind of a mess (never raised my voice or got angry though). 

A week or so later, I wasn’t doing great. Made the mistake of getting drunk alone at home, then made the horrible mistake of trying to text her. I asked if she’d thought about us and if she was willing to talk. I got hit with “Don’t contact me. It’s not coming across to you so I’m being explicit. I want nothing from you except to never hear from you or see you again. I’m blocking your number. Contact me again and I’ll be getting a restraining order. Go get some help and leave me alone.” So that was great. 

I haven’t been doing great. Between how exhausted everything made me, and the fact that this relationship and breakup managed to hit most of my relationship insecurities, I’ve been kind of a mess. It’s just been rough realizing how I hardly ever felt appreciated, valued, respected, or prioritized throughout our relationship, and how I never really felt like she saw me as a partner or us as a team.  I realized that I made a lot of excuses for her, given her childhood trauma and this being her first attempt at a serious relationship. A lot of her points about her not knowing me or us not having plans for the future felt really gaslighty and it’s messed with my head a lot. That and the constant nitpicking kind of destroyed my self esteem. I honestly felt better after breaking things off with my ex-fiancée than I do after this breakup. 

Oh well, guess I have a lot of work to do on myself. I’m sorry that this probably wasn’t a satisfying ending. 

TLDR; I didn’t get a chance to bring up the show incident, she found a way to blow up the relationship first. The show thing ended up being just another issue in a sea of issues. ",1727265710.0,Responsible_Log_5039,relationships
I (f32) kind of want my boyfriend (m35) to be my dad,"Just the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him.

Some background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.

I've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.

The more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.

To be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him ""I wish I'd had a dad like you"" and he said ""I wish you did too."" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.

It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.

TL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?

EDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him.

UPDATE: My (19F) Biological father’s (45M) wife (40F) wants me to just “leave them alone”,"Hello! Sorry this update has taken a while to come out, but I promise there is a good reason for it!

1. My girlfriend drove down to visit me for a week and I was preoccupied spending time with her

2. I was really hoping that the news I have to share with you would change

So long story short, I took the advice I was given and muted Heather’s messages to me. The stuff she was saying to me has really gotten to me and at this point I’m not quite sure if I’m the bad guy. I called Harold and talked to him about the situation, and told him that I don’t think it is in my best interests to be talking to his wife. 

This is where things took a bit of a sad turn. Harold agreed with his wife and said it would be best if I just left them alone for a while. I was stunned for a few moments, because this is the opposite of what he had told me less than 24 hours earlier. That said, even if he had said something else beforehand, I know that I have to respect his decision. I told him that I would stop all contact, and when he is ready to talk again it will be on him to message me. That’s where the call ended, and we haven’t spoken since.

It sucks. I’m kinda hurt. I know I have no right to be hurt about it, but I still am. I’ve come to the decision that it’s not my job to make them like me. This was probably not going to end any other way. It’s painful, but it’s the world we live in.

I’m sorry I don’t have a happier ending to share, but I’d still like to thank you guys for the amount of support and loving messages I received on my first post. I don’t think I could have endured this without you guys, and the validation you provided me. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to send such kind messages and helpful advice. I appreciate each and every one of you, and am sending virtual hugs!

TLDR: Harold’s wife got to him, and there is no more contact. She won, and I am leaving them alone.

(ALSO if I link the old post wrong, please let me know so I can fix it!)

EDIT: Yooo!! I got on one of the Reddit YouTube videos! Apparently everyone on YouTube either thinks the story is fake, or that Heather’s sons don’t belong to Harold. ALSO, I still haven’t heard anything from Harold. I’m starting to think that something is either very wrong, or they genuinely don’t want me around. I’ve stuck to my guns though, and I’m not contacting them.

Edit 2, in October: Two things have happened! 

1. I needed to reach out to him because my cat got sick again and he works in pet insurance and care, and I asked him for advice on what insurance carrier to use. It was cordial and completely professional. No emotions and nothing other than business. It hurt to see him act so cold, but thus is life. 

2. His wife, who my Dad (Markus) now refers to exclusively as “Heather”, updated her Facebook so that it says “Stay in your lane, Bitch”, directly under her name when you click on her profile. I feel grossed out that she’s acting like I’m some jealous lover who wants to “steal her man”. I’m his kid, not his affair partner. 

Also I’m going down to see my girlfriend this December!! She’s been the biggest help and support throughout this disaster. If I ever get a more significant update, I’ll ask the mods to let me post a part 3! I doubt I’ll get one though. I think this is where this saga ends. I have an adopted dad who loves me, and a biological mother who loves me. I think I can be content with that. :)",1628603024.0,Throwawayadoptedgirl,relationships
I (29F) feel like a side character in my BF’s (33M) life. How do I tell if it’s bad enough to be over?,"Please please please know that my boyfriend is a very good person and that I love him very much, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point because I can’t compete with his life anymore, and I really need some advice.

Full disclosure: My boyfriend and I moved very quickly in our relationship. It was the type of instant and intense “love at first sight” where it felt almost uncanny how similar we were..

I felt such an instant and intimate connection to him that I didn’t think twice about quitting my career and moving to a different state with him quite quickly, and despite that risk it actually worked out really well until recently.

I began noticing last winter that I felt more like an accessory to my boyfriend’s life, and that he seemed like he was still living a bachelor life. The first major fracture of our relationship was when he merged businesses with a friend on a whim and moved cities to go work with him, meaning that instead of being home every night like he normally was, he was gone 3-4 days a week. I won’t lie to say that I was furious. I wanted to be happy and supportive of his business decisions, but he made literally no effort in discussing this to me beforehand.

The next fracture came from something that I had signed up for willingly, but it has become a problem as I’ve grown to start feeling resentful. My boyfriend owns a business with his family, who he is extremely close with. All of his time when he is back home gets put into the family business. In the beginning, I was really enthusiastic about this business, and I would volunteer time to get to know his parents and the community better, but now I want nothing to do with it because it feels like there’s way too much expectation for me to engage with it.

His parents were very welcoming to me, and they entrusted me to do a lot with the business which I was happy to do, but now that my boyfriend is gone most of the week, it seems like even more of my time is being spent maintaining aspects of my boyfriend’s life instead of me trying to carve a place for myself in my new home.

Then there’s the problem that when my boyfriend is at home, all of his time goes into this family business, and so I feel even further away from the main cast of his life. Weirdly enough, now I’m much closer with my boyfriend’s sister than I am with my boyfriend, as her and I hang out and talk more than I do with him, which would be a lovely and beautiful thing if I also had that with my boyfriend, but instead I feel that if it weren’t for his sister supporting me, I’d be abandoned.

Finally the last major fracture is the dog we have together. Our dog is a highly energetic breed and requires a lot of attention and time. This was no issue in the beginning and the dog always felt naturally like “my dog” but it was the expectation that both my boyfriend and I would take care of her. Yet now our dog seems to have been back-seated, just like me. 

For example, if I’ve asked my boyfriend to watch the dog because I’m vacuuming or cooking or even want time by myself, he will take her for 20 minutes and then eventually lose concentration until she comes to find me in hopes I will play with her.

I actually had a bit of a freakout about this when my boyfriend and I were invited to a big family celebration a few weeks ago. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to bring the dog because she is way too excitable around people and I just wanted to focus on meeting some of his extended family and making a good first impression with them, since he is so close to his family. My boyfriend begged me to take the dog with us because he missed her.

I reluctantly agreed, only because he swore that “he would take care of her and that there would be a lot of other dogs there.” My boyfriend also promised he wouldn’t drink because my car was in the shop and we had to drive his vehicle, which is standard and something I can’t drive because I never learned how to drive stick. 

We show up, and embarrassingly we are the only people there with a dog. My boyfriend abandoned me almost immediately to spend time and to catch up with his family members, who I couldn’t meet because my dog is extremely excitable around people, so I have to stay in the outer circle of the fun with her so that she can remain relaxed. 

Worse yet is the hostess, and a few people who helped her set up, swung by and commented that “they were hoping that this would be a no-dog party” and that “they would make sure I know next time when dogs aren’t allowed” and it felt so awfully embarrassing to me that I nearly cried. 

There I was, all alone at a party where I don’t know anyone, with an animal tied to my hand which clearly was extremely unwelcomed, and to make it worse now looks like it was my idea because I’m hanging on the sidelines avoiding people instead of socializing.

Even more devastating was when I did finally find my boyfriend, he was already halfway to being drunk, to which he laughed and said to me “we can just take a taxi!” Through gritted teeth, I then told him “We can’t. We have the dog!” 

The only thing that saved us was my boyfriend’s extremely nice uncle, who I think was a mind reader or something. He came up to me, as I was nearly in tears and asked me how I was getting home. I explained the situation and he gave me the keys to his car so that me, the dog and my boyfriend could get home that night.

That last situation very much felt like the final straw and we had a massive blow out about it. It wasn’t the first conversation we had about this type of thing, and yet over and over and over again my boyfriend keeps telling me “I’m #1” and “tell me what to do so I can change.”

But I don’t want to be that person who is the dictator in someone else’s life and keep putting up ultimatums. I don’t want to have to feel like I’m competing with someone else’s life or like I have to explain to them how to treat me like a girlfriend instead of just some afterthought.

We had a conversation again last night where I told him I was unhappy, and I asked him if he understood why. I was hoping, praying, that from all of our conversations he would know. And yet all he could say was that he could tell I was unhappy in our relationship but he didn’t understand what for.

I went numb. It feels like if I walked out tomorrow nothing in his life would change, except maybe he wouldn’t have to have conversations anymore about how impossible it is to make me happy.

I just feel like an accessory and it hurts so bad.

Yet I still don’t know if this relationship is worth giving up because my boyfriend does love me and we align so well in our life goals. 

I finally broke down and spilled the beans to his sister, who calmly said “My brother is a good man and I can see he loves you very much, but he’s always been immature in his relationships and his idea of compromising is him saying he’s willing to compromise.” She then told me that she would support me no matter what I do.

Does anyone know what I can do?

Has anyone ever felt like an accessory in their relationship?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend continues to live his life as a bachelor despite me living with him and us building a life together. He makes big decisions by himself without talking to me about them, and I feel like I have to run his life when he’s gone. His total freedom in his life makes me feel chained to maintaining our relationship instead of us being equal life partners. Is it over?",1659099045.0,Local_Philosophy_741,relationships
[UPDATE] my (23f) bf (28m) checks out EVERY SINGLE WOMAN,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b9aeqt/my_23f_bf_28m_checks_out_every_single_woman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Hi! So this wasn’t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. 

The evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said “baby, there anything I can do to be better for you?”. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said “idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we’re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.” He seemed a little fake surprised and was like “really? Oh I didn’t know I did it so much and so obviously.” I didn’t want to push the agenda so much because I know he’s a thinker and will think about it even if we don’t discuss it further.

The next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he’s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven’t seen any overt staring at both men and women.

Thank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.

Girlfriend (25F) is terrible at indicating she wants sex and then gets mad when I (25M) don’t recognize it,"Girlfriend and I live together, and both work from home. Our sex life is good, having sex or similar activities once or twice a week or so on average. I usually initiate it and tell her that if there are times she’s in the mood that I haven’t initiated, she is welcome to start something and I will usually be happy to go along. However, she is really bad at it, and then is upset when I “reject her.” Here are some examples:


I’m working in the office, GF comes in and says “hey is there anything you want for lunch?” And I say “idk I’ll probably make pasta or a sandwich or something”. She then looks disappointed and leaves. The rest of the day, she is pouty and sad. I ask what’s up and she says that eating lunch was supposed to be code for having sex during our lunch break.


After work, I usually do chores for a bit before we work on dinner. I was washing dishes when GF came back from the store. She says “I’m gonna go change” because she is wearing normal clothes and prefers to wear sweatpants-type stuff when lounging around the house. I say ok and she goes into the bedroom with the door closed. I do chores for like ten minutes and then she comes out of the room all annoyed, saying that she wanted me to come in while she was changing and start sexy times. How was I supposed to know that? Changing after getting home is not an abnormal thing to me.


GF goes for a bike ride and gets home all sweaty. She says she’s going to shower, I’m like ok cool. When she is done, she says that she is disappointed I didn’t come join her in the shower. This is despite our shower not being very roomy and her turning me down for shower activity together in the past, explicitly because there’s not much room for 2 people.


I have told her that she needs to be more direct if she wants to signal that she wants sex, but she is not getting better and it is quite frustrating when she starts pouting just because I don’t pick up on the signals. She has said that she wants the person that she is with to just know when she’s in the mood, but I am not a mind reader and feel like she’s saying things that people might say all the time in a normal setting. How can I improve this?

"Update to Nightmare Situation: Me(35F) with Partner(40M), my son and his nephew (15Ms)","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare\_situation\_me35f\_with\_partner40m\_my\_son/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare_situation_me35f_with_partner40m_my_son/)

Hi again everyone. I posted about my family problem about a month ago and was bowled over by the amount of kind and extremely helpful comments I got. Someone requested an update, so I'm posting now to tell you what's happened since. To be honest it's also to unburden myself, the boys are really sweet but I obviously can't talk to them about these things and there aren't a lot of people in my life I feel comfortable sharing all the details with. I suppose I'm embarrassed.

The week after my original post, I met with a family lawyer I know to go over options. I actually wrote down the legal suggestions posted here to discuss with her, but unfortunately, after going over each and several others in detail, we had to conclude that for each one, while it might technically be feasible, it would either take too long to be practical, or require things from Bob or from Ben which for various reasons were not ideal. Following the meeting, I was mulling things over and decided to take a long hard look at our finances to see what might be affordable as a compromise, such as perhaps sending Ben to a GOOD boarding school and pay tuition up front, so that if I then left Bob it would be easier and cheaper for him to leave Ben there rather than move him to a different school.

Anyway, I went over our financial records with a fine-toothed comb, and that's when I discovered Bob was cheating on me, and had been for the entirety of our relationship. It turns out that, prior to Ben's parents' death, Bob had been about to move in with another woman. This woman didn't want kids, so when Bob was suddenly faced with taking custody of Ben or seeing him placed in foster care, she made it clear she would not be involved (for the record I can't say I blame her - I love my boys with all my heart, but asking someone who never wanted kids to parent a bereaved 11 year old she has never met is not in anyone's best interests in my opinion). When I confronted him about the affair, he didn't even attempt to deny it. He seemed ashamed (good!!) and just asked what happened next, so I told him that next he was going to get his stuff and get out of my house, but first ask Ben if he wants to go or stay, because it wouldn't be fair to disrupt the poor kid's life any further. Ben quickly said he preferred to stay, and Bob seemed frankly relieved. He moved out that weekend and I haven't seen him since. We've been in touch by text to discuss financial arrangements, though, and last week he sent me money to cover Ben's basic expenses (nothing like as much as child support, but under the circumstances I'll take it and be glad). From his attitude I take it that he's seeing this as a longterm thing, but even he doesn't, according to the family lawyer, his leaving Ben with me even for a while, along with Ben's age and the fact that Bob is his guardian rather than his father, would make it easier to build a case for Ben to stay even if Bob does try to fight it. The lawyer is confident that such a battle could be won, or at least dragged out till Ben is 18 and it doesn't matter anymore. So that, as you can imagine, has been an enormous relief.

That makes it that much harder to admit that finding out about Bob has still hit me hard. The fact is that, even though I was absolutely done with him and wanted him out, there was a time I truly believed he wanted to be with me and that we could build a life together. I knew our relationship wasn't a romance for the ages or anything like that, but it was by far the best I'd had since before my son was born and I really thought we cared for and valued one another. Now I realise that all he ever wanted from me was a mother for Ben. He as good as admitted it, and in retrospect it makes complete sense. That's why he never wanted to get married or buy into my house even though I offered (though now of course I am grateful!), because he wanted to make it as easy as possible to split from me once Ben was old enough to no longer require my services. I think it might even explain why he was so hard on Ben and grasping at straws for a reason to send him away. I never expected it of him based on what else I knew or I never would have been with him, but if he was blaming Ben for getting in the way of his life and simultaneously feeling guilty for, that could turn a mild-mannered person mean I think. Maybe he even thought if Ben was away most of the time the other woman would be willing to compromise for a few years? I don't know. I've even been wondering whether he decided to pursue me before we'd even met (the boys met first through an extracurricular where they became friends. It's possible that Jason mentioned my being single in passing, allowing Bob to identify me as potentially 'suitable' before we ever met).

I'm sorry this is such a mopey post, I truly am grateful for the way things worked out, I think it's the best possible solution for everyone under the circumstances, and not one I could have achieved without Bob's 'help'. And the boys have been wonderful, they didn't know I was trying to get Bob out anyway so they've been treating me very gently (or as gently as you can expect teenage boys to be, anyway) and trying to pretend they aren't thrilled Bob is gone when I'm in the room. I'm glad of that, to be honest. I AM so grateful he's gone and Ben is still safe here with us, I just need a bit of time to really remember it, I think.

TL;DR: It turns out Bob has been cheating on me most likely for the entire duration of our relationship. He's moved out and left Ben with me.",1624214830.0,Unique-Emergency3407,relationships
How to deal with my dad (50/M) moving his GF (48/F) in as a 16/F teenager?,"

My dad recently moved his partner in without asking me or my siblings if it was ok.

This has created a lot of awkwardness for us, and my 2 younger siblings keep telling me they are uncomfortable living with her because it’s like having a stranger in our house. I feel the same way. I don’t really know how to cope so I’ve just not really talked to her beyond saying hi and good night and how was your day to her. 

Recently, my dad has asked me why I haven’t talked to her more and I told him that I’m not that outgoing or talkative with strangers. He said that she wasn’t a stranger and I said she felt like one. I asked why it wasn’t ok for me to just coexist with her in the house and to just only exchange small pleasantries, and he got angry at me and said I needed to make her feel welcome. 

I just don’t know how. She seems nice, but I’ve been feeling depressed about not seeing my friends, and so I’m tired and run-down a lot. I have a bad relationship with my mom, too, so I’m wary of older women and women who are in a position to be maternal.

Is this a good enough reason for me [f/27] to break up with my live in partner [m/29] over the phone?,"Here's why I'm concerned my partner of one year, whom I moved in with a few months ago, is manipulative:

* Tried to break up twice previously and he used a chronic illness to guilt me into staying. (He's okay - doesn't require any care or anything, but the ""what if"" always gets me.)
* He'll ask for sex over and over and over again until I say yes or go to sleep. It's jokingly, but it's consistent even when I already said no or gave a reason why not (ex. yeast infection). It's gotten better in the last month or two, but before that was practically harassment.
* Recently he tried a ""joke"" which seemed really manipulative. We were texting about sexual frequency. I was texting we could try every other day (I often experience pain during sex and need time to recover, and obviously with pain I have a pretty low libido; we've been having sex been twice per week recently). He said ""oh we should have sex today then"" and tried to convince me we hadn't had sex yesterday. When I asked what he would have done if I hadn't noticed he basically said he would have been disappointed in my reasoning skills and thought less of me. 
* He said he didn't mind when I was in pain during sex a couple weeks ago, because he wanted me to feel the emotional hurt he felt from a sexual rejection the previous day. I hadn't been kind because I was tired of being asked when I was in pain. I think I asked if he could just leave me alone for the evening.
* He'll use ""but we love each other"" as a phrase to convince me to do things - mostly letting him grab or ""examine me"" when I'm busy. Or doing something I'm not interested in, like swallowing after a blow job or kissing him when he hasn't brushed his teeth. I can say no, but I really have to stick to my guns as he'll ask multiple times in different ways to try and convince me. For example, he's asked me to swallow during a blow job multiple times per week, but I've only ever agreed once. But for the kissing I'll usually just give in after he asks a few times (ex. he'll ask while I'm at a red light while driving - I've said it makes me uncomfortable because it's unsafe).
* He withdraws affection and uses the silent treatment often - from when I bought the wrong kind of cereal to when I say no to sex (which is admittedly often). He says it's just because he doesn't want to talk, he's grumpy, and not to take it personally. I know some people just need time to process things, but he seems to need a lot of time to process things which would have been really low stakes in previous relationships and it puts me on edge (spilling water, booking an appointment a day late when there was no reason to have it earlier, forgetting a non-essential ingredient in supper).

He loves me a lot, doesn't see any of these behaviours as bad or manipulative. Maybe I see them as more insidious than they are, I don't know. I don't have confidence I could break up in person due to my previous failures. We have a trip planned tomorrow (nothing major, visit to my home town, no money put down - he's super excited about it though). I know we need to break up, and before the trip is probably more kind, though he won't see it that way. 

Part of me thinks if breaking up over the phone is the only way I can do it, then that's fine. I can move out tomorrow to a friend's house while he's at work. Maybe with a meeting in a few days if he wants it. However, 90% of the time the relationship is really good. Day to day we fight very little and have a ton of fun. I would say he likes to push my sexual boundaries in small ways, but he's never physically forced me to do anything. It's like there are two sides of him. The easily to annoy side who gives me the silent treatment and keeps asking for a kiss with stinky breath.... And the other side who I spent 90% of my time with who I love a lot. We have a ton in common and a really lovely life together. 

It feels so heartbreaking and disrespectful over the phone, but I don't see it going well in person. He will be extremely heartbroken - he has said he'd be destroyed if we ever break up, he's never loved anyone as much as me, etc.. This also scares me in a way, as most adult breakups I've had, even one-sided, have been pretty respectful and easy. Super sad, sure, but always with empathy on both sides. I've never had to leave someone begging me to stay while guilting me.

He'd never hurt me by the way - it's just emotional stuff and from previous experience I know he'll say anything and guilt me in any way to get me to stay.

TL;DR: I need to break up with my boyfriend before a trip. I'm worried I won't go through with it in person because he can be very manipulative. Is it okay to break up over the phone?",1599133450.0,moodybeets,relationships
I (34 f) went through a bag in my boyfriends (36 m) apartment and found things I shouldn't of.,"Shouldn't *have* 

I found something out about my boyfriend that i am not supposed to know.

I (34 f) went through a bag in my boyfriends (36 m) apartment that was just sitting out in the open. I saw that it was a bag of personal things like notes, cards and pictures of his ex from before we dated. (pictures of me and cards i wrote were also in the bag) I know i should not have looked into it, but i did, and now i cant stop thinking about it.

I have no good excuse. I saw a card, knew it wasn't from me, and my curiosity got the best of me.

I do not want to get into super specifics, but when I found notes, letters and cards from his ex 
Several things stood out.

She refers to him as a pet name that he recently started calling me. It didnt bother me at first but the first time he said it to me, it was almost like it slipped out. Like an accident, and now I know why. Its because it was an accident. Its what they called each other. It is not a regular pet name like ""baby"" it is a very specific word/phrase and now whenever i hear him say it i think of her. I do not know how to tell him i dont want him to say it anymore because it will only make me think of her...

Second, she wrote very specific things that they had done in their relationship, sexually. I wished i had not seen this, but once i saw it i could not stop myself from reading it. She wrote contracts, demanded certain things from him and gave him rewards and punishments.

It seems like they has a very *experimental* relationship, for lack of a better word. And she was a ""Dom"" in a BDSM type relationship.

Well, heres why this bothers me.

Previously my boyfriend has expressed that HE really wants a bdsm relationship and he has ""never had a dom"" before and this would be a great fun way experiment in our relationship, he even suggested i make contracts and give him daily tasks and it would be ""our secret""

I agreed.

The problem is, when i found out she would write contracts and make him do daily tasks... I feel like I am being taken for a fool now. This is not our ""secret"" and this is not his first time doing this.. 

Now i feel like it is something he needs. If he had told me this is how he has had relationships in the past, id like to think i would have been okay with it. But he lied about it. He lied to me and he thinks i believe that i am the first, and only girl he has had this type of relationship with.

I stay awake at night and i cannot sleep because i am wondering. ""Does he like me? Or does he only like this type of relationship? Is he dating me to recreate what he had with his ex? Am i as good as his ex?"" It is starting to eat me alive.

I feel betrayed. I feel like he really thinks im stupid and he pulled one over on me. When we started doing bdsm things he seemed so natural. Like it was something he has obviously been very familiar with. Something he has not been supressing, but something he was experienced in.

I gave him several opportunities to come clean, over the last several weeks i have asked ""are you sure you have not tried this before, its okay if you have"" and he doubles down and insists i am his only partner he has done this with, he even got angry that i brought it up more than once. But I know the truth.

It gives me the ick. It makes me feel foolish to have believed him before.

I have brought it up twice like ""youre so good at this"" and he will not admit he has previous relationships like this.

It really is a bummer.

I feel like i have lost trust in him. And he is not going to trust me when i tell him i found these letters and read them. They are obviously private things they shared, and for some reason he kept them.

The fact that he did not tell me that he had relationships in the past probably means he doesnt trust me anyway.

I dont know how to come clean. 

I feel as though when i tell him i know he is lying, he will become defensive and the focus is going to be about me going through his personal things and about how he cannot trust me.

I really need the conversation to be about why he lied to me, and then i can address why i looked through his things. I just know he will stonewall me and it will not be easy.

How do i get over this? I almost want to stop all bdsm all together to see if we can mend things before we go further. It really doesnt sit right with me now.

I am also going to be out if town for the next 2 weeks and will not see him again until September 30th. I feel like we should have this conversation in person

Tldr: i went through my boyfriends personal things and found out he has been lying to me about his past relationship, and the kinky things we do in our relationship is just a mirror of what he did with his ex.
Trying to cope, and also come clean about finding these things, without him getting angry that i found personal things from his past, but i cannot continue our relationship without addressing it.


Edit: I want to say really quickly that is was a clear ziplock freezer bag that I could see into before I even looked inside. I could see a note to him with partial words. One of the words stood out. That is why I looked.",1726528214.0,trustandbetray,relationships

Thank you to everyone who took the time to give me advice. I finally saw him last weekend for the first time in about seven weeks (he invited me over). He seemed happy to see me at first, but things just seemed a little...off. Like we didn't know what to say to each other.

I stayed with him on the Saturday night. Had a shower Sunday morning and the first thing I saw was a bottle of camellia-scented body scrub that was definitely not mine and I can't remember ever seeing it before. He lives alone. INSTANT RED FLAG. Stupidly I didn't confront him about it straight away, I wish I had.

Over the next couple of days I tried to make conversation with him and he either left me on read or sent really short replies. Finally, on Wednesday night I'd had enough - and I'm not proud of how I acted but I was so hurt by the anxiety and the pain of feeling rejected - I blocked him on Facebook without any warning.

The following afternoon, I got a text message *""Hey, ummm...so did you block me?""*

I responded:  
*I did. I give up. Life's too short to be someone's afterthought.*  
*Whether you've just lost interest or whether there's somebody else (when you jump in the shower on a Sunday morning and see girly body scrub that isn't yours, you gotta wonder), or both, I really don't care. I deserve better and it's not worth feeling like a dirty little secret and feeling like shit when I could be happy by myself, or go find someone who lifts me up and genuinely wants to be in my life and vice versa. I'm angry at myself for letting this drag out for so long. I should have let go ages ago but I guess I hoped that things would get better. More fool me.*

Haven't heard from him since so I guess the trash took itself out! He clearly didn't care about me at all. I'm 31 tomorrow, looks like I'll be spending it free and single! 

TL;DR - saw partner for first time in 7 weeks, things seemed off, found girly body scrub in shower that didn't belong to me, saw red, blocked him on social media. Now single.",1569655885.0,edenbeam058,relationships
My fiancé (33M) only touches me (33F) for 5-10 minutes everyday,"I’ve been with my fiancé for 3 years and plan to get married next year. We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together.

But I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights.

We used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, “just get on top”— so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I’m on top because it’s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he’s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands towards my vagina so I can finish as well. 

When we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can’t help but feel like I’ve just replaced his hand. 

A few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn’t sleep. He asked to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I’ve never felt so used in my life.

After work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically throughout the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we’re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it’s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch.

Every night, we’ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he’s going to bed. He’ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I’m ready to sleep and get into bed, he’s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight.

As we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I’m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep.

He wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I’m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort.

On weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized.

I have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it’s all not true and “we do cuddle!!!” With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?

TL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I’m not feeling loved.  


—-

Edit: A commenter asked if he shows his love in other ways. Yes, he will buy me flowers and say I love you multiple times a day. Every morning when he gets to work he sends me a kissing emoji. He will wash the dishes and has made dinner. His love language is definitely acts of service. 

We can have intimate, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual conversations. There are so many reasons why I love him and want to have a future with him. We respect each other as partners. We are good at communication and have managed to talk through our issues as they come up but on this particular topic of sex and physical contact is where it’s been the most difficult.",1564574314.0,catville13337,relationships
I'm (27F) buying a house for myself and my boyfriend (33M) of 5 years to live in. He wants his name on the house. I'm not comfortable with that but how can I tell him that without making him feel bad?,"TL;DR I'm going to be the sole party on the mortgage for the property myself and my partner rent. He wants his name on the house and I don't feel comfortable with that. How do I tell him this without hurting his feelings or creating a dispute?

So I'm (27F) buying a house for myself and my boyfriend (33M) of 5 years to live in.

The property we're renting is being sold and I verbally agreed I'd buy it from the landlord. I never even considered that my boyfriend would be involved in the buying process bc my income is enough to get the mortgage, we're not married, he has bad credit. So I was going to have the house in my name with all my debts and finances.

The landlord said he knows we're not married and when it comes down to filling out the paperwork, he doesn't care whose name is on the house. This is my first time buying a house so I think he's talking about the deed. Since my boyfriend heard that, he wants his name on the deed. I think he means both of us but I'm not comfortable with that. 

There are many reasons it's not a good idea but there are very few as to why it might be good. I see it as my house if I'm getting the mortgage. Both of my siblings have bought homes with their partners and it's been the one who has the mortgage that also owns the house. It only makes sense to me. I think I am being practical about the scenario where we don't get married and stay together forever. It could cause legal issues if we're both owners. I don't see myself living here if something like that were to happen, so he could stay and rent from me but I can understand his hesitation to trust that.

But I can't really see it from his side so I can't figure out how to talk to him about it. How do I talk about this? And what I want to say is no, so how can I put put my foot down without causing a dispute?",1589907766.0,delicatelysharp,relationships
Partner of 10 years cheated and new girlfriend broke the news to get rid of me for good.,"I F28 was with M27 for 10 years as we met in high school. We were long distance for essentially a year this month as I moved to a different country for uni and he was working on following to the country I am in as his family is based here too. He ended up having an entire relationship and I found out he had been lying to me about travelling alone and was going to see her. She reached out to me on IG and asked me if it’s true that “we were on a break then officially broke up” since my pictures were still on his instagram account. It was not true and he was lying to both of us. I immediately cut him off and blocked him on everything. He had called to confess and I couldn’t even be bothered to respond at all. I have since heard he was also flirting with and talking to other people who he would tell about me and they would also follow me and stalk me on instagram. Can you even imagine that level of disrespect?

 I could have written this in more detail but these are the significant points and I am just here to see what people have to say about these kind of people. Woke up to a notification of him logging into my apple ID from the city she’s in. He knows I would get a notification and see this and I wonder what he was doing with my apple ID. I have since changed the password but, I just wonder how I ended up in this situation.

 Everything else is going pretty swell as I am doing well in my academic career and the like. Just can’t imagine how you can date someone you hate so much for so long, what was even the point? What a world. I don’t even know what I expect from comments but I guess I just wanted to rant. Sorry if there are typos or if it’s overly vague I’m just too lazy to make an essay out of this. How would you process this kind of situation? What are your thoughts about this?

Tl;dr: Got cheated on by my ex of 10 years. New girlfriend initiated the break up and now I’m in shock really so I just cold turkey cut him off. What are your thoughts about how I handled the situation and is this kind of thing common? Im just so shocked really.

How should I (29F) proceed when my BF (29M) went on dating apps to see if he could find anyone better?,"
Did my BF (29M) cheat on me (29F)?

My BF (29M) and I (29F) are in a long distance relationship, and have been together for 7 months so far - but have known each other for well over a year.

He’s been very unsure about me for a long time, and consistently tells me he feels like we might be too similar and won’t be able to help each other grow in terms of looks, fashion, and attention to detail. But he said he really likes me for “who I am”. He just wishes that I was “cool” and can be not so nerdy and like a “good girl”.

One day, just after he met my parents, he mentioned that he’s still unsure about me and requested an open relationship. I got a little hurt, and told him that I’m not looking for anything poly or open. And so, if he wants to be in an open relationship, then I will consider this a break up.

We decided to take the next few hours to decide whether we should be together or not. 

When we came back to each other, he mentioned he wanted to be with me only and actively chooses to be with me. However, he then let it slip that he went on dating apps for a bit to see what “else is out there” and feel validated that he could “do better”. He claimed that he didn’t swipe right on anyone, but just wanted to see if he could truly find someone better looking and more cool than me.

I got extremely hurt by this. While I understand and I do trust that he didn’t swipe right on any woman, I feel extremely disrespected. When I told him this, he didn’t seem to think he cheated. And told me that “most men constantly evaluate whether their partners are good for them or not up until they propose”.

I don’t know how to proceed or move on. I’m still hurt and it’s been a few weeks since we had this argument. We’re technically still together, but it’s hard for me to trust that he isn’t constantly looking for someone better than me out there. I don’t know if he cheated on me or what, but I feel extremely hurt and just worthless.

Any advice? I’m not looking for anyone to judge him. Just trying to see if this relationship is worth fighting for.

"I (17F) don’t know what to do about my relationship (of three years) with my gf(16F). Is it toxic, or is she a good partner, or am I overthinking?","TL;DR: I feel like this relationship is falling apart, and I can’t tell if it’s my fault, (I don’t make her feel wanted or loved), or if I’m reading into things (due to my own personal anxiety issues), and I don’t know where to go from here

To start from the beginning, I’ve noticed around some time in the middle of 2024 that the relationship isn’t making me feel as happy as it should. It also feels like a friendship rather than a relationship? Essentially, it feels like I’m more sad than happy in this relationship. I just can’t under what to do because of that. 

—For starters, during the school year we argue a lot. Not like fighting or yelling, just little disagreements, but it happens A LOT
—we have communicated and discussed our problems with each other. Her main problem with me is that i don’t make her feel wanted and loved, and that I’m always criticizing her. That’s completely valid, I get it, and I’ve been putting in effort and improving on my part. I text and call her more, and I’m not criticizing her anymore. (For context the criticism would be something like disagreeing on an opinion or intellectual issue like math or philosophy or something. If you ask for a specific example I will give you one).
—my main issue with her is that she doesn’t seem to care about me if it inconveniences her. When I’m talking, she will start talking to someone else when I’m mid sentence. When I’m venting, she just brushes past it and says she doesn’t know how to help. I get that, so I tell her that I just want her to comfort me and be there for me, and she decides to just leave me alone (not talking to me about it and just hanging out with our friends). She’s not my therapist, so i understand I’m not entitled to her help with certain issues, but it still feels bad? She also seems to not pay attention to me. I’ve been trying to talk and be more present for her (which I’m not used to as I hate talking, and will fall completely mute unless necessary sometimes. I also have rejection anxiety, which I’m working on, but that makes it hard to be more forthcoming and assertive in conversation), but she will go on her phone, talk to our friends, or simply tell me that what I’m talking about is boring. It makes me feel like talking to her more is pointless.
—she is really funny and hard working. She is so pretty and kind and expressive. She’s an amazing and inspiring person, and when we have good moments, they are SO good. That’s why figuring out what to do is hard. I’m scared to end things because we have all the same classes, friends, and we’ve been together for SO long. It’ll be a hard experience to get through, and I don’t want to regret it. I also feel like I need time to make myself a better person before being in a relationship rn. She’s also my best friend. I love her, both as a partner and as a friend, and losing that friendship is hard to, because she gets me better than anyone. 

I guess the question(s) I’m asking is where do I go from here? I think discussing it with someone will help me understand what I want. Is she objectively a good partner who I should stick it out for and try to repair our relationship with?

UPDATE: I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good.,"Update in regards to: my original post that ""[I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g7x81m/i_asked_my_bf_for_alone_time_and_he_told_me_to/)."" 

Well, as a likely shock to no one, we (me, 30F and him, 29M) broke up. It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn’t meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us. 

Ultimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle.

We aren't in contact this time. He found the original thread I posted and was (understandably) hurt by what I wrote and for not sticking up for him. I am sad, mourning ending the relationship, and feeling bad for hurting someone I care about. Frustrated that it was so messy, that it didn't work out, etc... just taking things a day at a time and trusting that I made the right choice (which is hard when there's no answer key for life to check against.)

UPDATE: My (29M) soon to be ex-husband seems to feel entitled to another chance with me (28F).,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gklndb/my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Well, turns out my gut instincts were right. The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass. 

 I thank the universe every day that he is no longer connected to me in a romantic way. It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy. 

To anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden.

How do I 30M come back from yelling at my pregnant wife 26F?,"I have been with my wife 4 years. I have a 5 year old from a previous relationship. My 5 year old (L) is from my first long term relationship during college. We split shortly after her birth, as my then-partner admitted to being unfaithful and not being ready to start a family.

My daughter LOVES my wife. They are inseparable. My ex does not have much to do with my daughter or myself except cause the occasional drama. She did not want any custody or visitation time, so my wife is her mother for all intents and purposes. 

 My wife is almost 8 months pregnant. She has shut me out of the entire pregnancy but refuses to admit anything is wrong. I feel completely ignored and hurt.

When we first learned she was pregnant, she told me while I was making breakfast. Of course I was elated! However since it was an unplanned pregnancy I asked how she was feeling at first. She began smiling and crying about how excited she is. I picked her up, gave her a million kisses, and told her I was so excited to have a baby too, and what a wonderful mother she would be. All good right? She went all out to announce to everyone else. Balloons and boxes, tshirts and “best big sister” mugs. I assumed the casual announcement with me is because she wanted my feelings on growing our family before celebrating. However, when her sister asked about how I liked my box, my wife quickly said “he didn’t get one, this isn’t his first rodeo.”

It was like pulling teeth to get her to let me go to the ultrasound appointments. She didn’t want me to miss work, didn’t want to interrupt Ls routine, excuse after excuse. When it came to listening to the heartbeat, my wife instantly started crying happy tears. The tech was telling her how strong the heartbeat was, how precious our little one was, etc. I was feeling a bit emotional and cleared my throat to prevent crying. The tech said aw dad, isn’t that sound beautiful? My wife immediately said “this isn’t his first child, it’s not that special for him”. I immediately said this is one of the most important moments of my life. I can’t think of anything MORE special. The atmosphere was clearly awkward after. 

Another thing that bothered me, I heard L and my wife’s mom laughing in the living area (I was in the kitchen making dinner). When I walked in and asked what the fuss was about L was touching my wife’s stomach and was laughing with excitement that the baby was moving and it would be so cute. My wife let my daughter and MIL feel the baby move before me. I was hurt but simply said how happy I was. Later that night, my wife was poking her belly and laughing. I asked her to feel as well and she said, “you’ve felt L move as a baby. What can be better than that? She was the cutest baby ever”

She has felt pretty poorly throughout her pregnancy, but refuses to let me help her. If I bring her a snack and drink, she offers it to our daughter. If I try and rub her feet or legs, she asks me to play with our daughter so she doesn’t feel like she is being replaced or ignored. I simply do not ignore my daughter. We have bonding time, I’m an active parent but I want to love my wife! She can hardly eat but when I asked her what I can prepare for her, it’s “whatever L wants”. We went to the zoo with L, and my wife started feeling bad. She had cramps and was considering going to the hospital, severe nausea and dizziness. I carry her to a bench nearby, and she began to cry saying she can’t even stand up. I told her let me call an ambulance or I’ll carry you to the car and drive you. She said she didn’t want to ruin Ls trip and we didn’t even make it to the aviary (Ls favorite part). I said I wasn’t leaving when she asked me to continue to go through the zoo with L. We sat for a while until her dad showed up (she didn’t even tell me he was coming) and he took her to the Dr. I was shocked, and followed them with L. When we arrived, L was upset about missing the aviary and pouting. At that point the health of my wife and unborn child were my concern, I really didn’t care L was upset. My wife was IRATE that I made L miss out. 

Another example: we were watching L play in a local kids sport. I asked her, do you think our kid will be athletic? Artistic? Enjoy science or math? She said, this is Ls moment, we shouldn’t make it about someone who isn’t even here. L was on the field, we were sitting in the stands. We had both waved to her, held up a sign for her, everything. I just wanted to talk about OUR baby. 

When her bump was really showing, she would always show it off to anyone who wanted to look. Her family, friends, siblings, etc. do you want to see my bump? I’m huge, so excited, I can’t believe it’s only x more weeks. They all touch her bump, talk to it, etc. Her parents come and reads or tells “back in the day” stories. They go to the beach? A thousand bump pictures posted on her friends social media accounts “so ready to be an honorary auntie, her sister “wife puts the B in bump AND beautiful”. If we go out together? She wears the loosest clothes so I don’t see it. I’ll even see her pull her shirt down when she sees me come into the room. She sat on me the other day after being playful in bed. Her bump was right in my face, I ran my hands up it and said you are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, you already are a great mom to L, I can’t wait to see you as our family grows. This was one of the first times I was really able to feel her bump so I rested my hand there and said I love you so much already, I’m so excited to meet you. I hope you have your moms eyes”. She moved off of me and said “I know “ex partner” had a bigger bump than me, I bet it was fun seeing L move all the time. You don’t have to act like you care, I know you’ve done this before”. I said I don’t think about it that way. L is special, but this is a completely new and different special because it was with her and our baby was someone completely new and special. She began to leave the room and I could see her shoulders shake from crying. 

I am 100% positive she is not cheating, nor has she ever. I just cannot wrap my head around why she doesn’t want me to be happy about this? The rest of the time is completely normal as long as I don’t mention the baby. She is affectionate, initaties intimacy, brags about what a good husband I am and how great I’ve made this pregnancy. We plan for our future, have date nights, everything else. 

Unfortunately, we had a fight where I snapped. I had a break between clients at work, so I went to a local baby store and got a lot of things off of her list and Pinterest board. I came home and surprised her with flowers, a prenatal massage certificate, and her favorite food, as well as the baby items. She seemed very grateful, but when I came home the items were no longer there. She said she returned it to buy L stuff, as she was going to feel left out. I lost it, I cried for the first time in our marriage and yelled that having a child with her was the worst mistake I’ve ever made, that at least my deadbeat ex at least gave me the chance to know my unborn child. That I didn’t care about the baby because she wouldn’t even let me bond with it (I do care, have since she told me). That I hoped she was as miserable as she made me and that she better be prepared for a custody dispute (she is a SAHM for L). 

She simply said “I know you don’t care about the baby, but I’ll die before you take my baby from me.” What??? I have BEGGED her to let me interact with her/our baby. I asked her if her therapist had any insight on to why she was being like this- she said no, that she isn’t doing anything. I told her what I said above and she said I had those experiences already so it shouldn’t matter. 

I asked her if the baby was mine (I know it is, I was just being mean) she threw her phone at me and said yes, go through it. I’ll do a paternity test, whatever you need.  

I just called her parents and asked them to go to our house as we were having a disagreement and went to a hotel. I do not want to stress her or our unborn child, and I really want to repair this but I truly don’t know how. I’m staying at an Airbnb for now until we can figure this out, but I truly don’t know what to do. I miss her like crazy, and I can’t even begin to understand why she wants to behave this way. I have apologized for what I said, but I can’t take back what I said and I worry about when our baby is born if she will even want to be a family with me, or let me have anything to do with our baby. I spoke with a mutual friend who says she is very distraught and says she can’t be a single mom, loves me, but her actions prove the opposite time and time again even when I beg for change.

I [29m] feel like I should break up with my girlfriend [28f] because of lack of sexual chemistry. How can I prevent shredding her self-esteem?,"Tldr: I need to tell my girlfriend that the sexual chemistry between us does not work. How do I tell her without completely destroying her self-esteem? Need advice!

So my girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. We have a great emotional and mental bond and get along wonderfully. I realized that for me, the sexual chemistry was really low from the beginning. I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do.

As hard as it is, I feel like she deserves someone who's as much into her as she is into me. I don't want to end up in a long term relationship where both of us are unsatisfied with our sex life, even if all other domains are well. I feel like I can't give her what she wants and needs.

The thought of breaking up will probably already hurt her very much. She's planning a future with me and talks constantly about moving in together, starting a family etc. I'm afraid that telling her that the sexual chemistry does not work for me will shred her self-esteem and I really want to prevent this. I think my girlfriend is wonderful and beautiful but it somehow doesn't work for me sexually. I had flings with girls which were way below here judging by the looks with which the chemistry was not an issue. So how can I explain this to my girlfriend without completely devastating her? I really hope for some advice!

Edit: Holy... This blew up way more than I thought. I will try to answer as many questions as possible.  
So, some clarifications: I am not 100% sure yet if a break-up is the way to go. If it is, I have not accepted it yet just now. I will therefore talk to some people in my support net and try to get some time to think on my own.   
People thinking I have not tried working on this: I did. She realised that I am reluctant to sex sometimes. We tried to spice things up with toys, different places, etc. I cut down on self-enjoyment. Hell I am open to seeing a therapist. However, I am not sure if any of these things can affect the sexual chemistry.   
Anyway, I will try to make up my mind as soon as possible and let her know as soon as this happend.   
Thank you all for your advice! It is really appreciated.",1565957507.0,throwaway_____2019,relationships
I (40m) snooped on my wife’s (30f) of five years phone and found out how unhappy she is in our relationship.,"We met five years ago and got married two years in. We were inseparable. I knew she was the one when she never got tired of my slightly autistic and ADHD ass. She’s incredible. Gorgeous, smart, funny, she’s everything I’ve ever looked for in a partner. 

But I’m starting to think maybe I trapped her. We had an argument after our Valentine’s Dinner a few days ago and she said some really mean things to me (made fun of my weight gain for one.) Things haven’t been the same since. She gave me a very generic “I’m sorry for last night” the next morning. But that was it. I didn’t even acknowledge it. I haven’t been able to make eye contact with her. I’m not interested in talking to her and generally I have been avoiding her. 

Yesterday she had the day off and went to a party with friends. I wasn’t invited. She never told me about it. She didn’t want me there. She didn’t text me or call me all day from 10am until 2am when she got dropped off without her car. 

She passed out on the couch. 

I let my emotions get the best of me and I opened the Photos app on her phone, just to see how her day and night had gone. I didn’t find anything out of the ordinary and honestly it looked like she had a good time. 

I opened her text app and saw an exchange with her bff where she admitted that she said some “really mean shit” to me the other night. Her friend responded that “you said what you needed to say.” You know , being the good friend. My wife then replied “I really don’t like who I am in this relationship.”

Her browser window was also open and there was a page to an article called “how to tell if you’re unhappy in a relationship.”

I treat this woman like a queen. All five love languages every day. 

Now it’s obvious to anyone reading this, I have trust issues. I am in therapy working on them. My wife knows this. I was cheated on in several previous relationships going all the way back to my first girlfriend in high school. Since then I’ve had a really hard time trusting people, especially relationship partners. 

My wife and I spent the last six months in couples counseling. I stopped paying for sessions bc my wife wouldn’t do the homework. 

A few months ago she went to a wedding and flirted and made out with one of the groomsmen while drunk and then confessed the next morning. 

I know she resents me. She doesn’t communicate well. She has a bit of an alcohol problem (I’m dealing with some drug/medication issues too,) but I think she feels like I’ve caged her into this marriage and she feels disappointed in what I have to offer. I have two kids from a previous marriage. They’re both teens and she loves them to death. 

I guess need to make some changes I guess, or it sounds like we may be done. Any insight or wisdom would be helpful. Thanks! 

TLDR - I snooped my wife’s phone after she went radio silent for a day and found out how unhappy she is in our relationship.",1707647880.0,whymywife,relationships
"My (24f) partner (26m) is a good person, but I have reservations about the future. How do I handle this?","
We've been together 5.5 years and living together for 5. We've been through a lot. He's supported me through my healing journey from childhood trauma and a bad eating disorder. He's been with me from undergrad all the way until my finishing up my masters program. We looked at rings together and I know he bought one, but ever since I graduated several weeks ago, I've felt sick to my stomach about getting engaged to him.

He'd never cheat, he's trustworthy, we share a lot of similarities and feelings. He's been willing to work through and deal with my emotions, and loves me a lot. However, I have my reservations about him. 1. I don't know that I want to be a part of his family by marriage. I'm technically a part of the family now, but I don't know if that's something I want forever. They are loving people but can be overbearing and manipulative. 2. He does not have a great job (construction, $23/hr, 45 hour work weeks, no benefits) and he complains about it but the situation doesn't change. 3. We have some different political and human rights beliefs. Lastly, my family members aren't completely fond of him and feel like I could do/be treated better.

When I've communicated my reservations to him, he says I need to trust him and that you have to work for love. While I don't  disagree, I don't think that's the sole issue at hand. He stated that he loves me a lot and will ""fight"" for me, and he thinks I'm focusing too much on the negative than the positive. I'm having a hard time because this is my first ever serious relationship and I've never gone through anything like this.


Tldr; partner is trustworthy, loving, caring, etc but we have some differences that I don't know I'm okay with. I just finished grad school and knew a proposal was on the way and begin to have a bad gut feeling, despite feeling fine about things while in school. This is my first ever adult relationship and I don't know what to do and I'm scared to leave but don't know if I will ever marry him or not ",1717691487.0,BlushingFlamingos,relationships
"Together 10 years: M(48) F(47) We tell people we're married, but we're not and M(48) doesn't want to. Why?","I am a 47 year old woman. I've been with my 48 year old male partner for 10 years. We have a 5 year old daughter. We had a marriage ceremony with my family 8 years ago but my partner did not want to file the marriage certificate because he said it would cost us too much on taxes. He calls me his wife and I call him my husband. We wear wedding rings. When I had our daughter I left a really successful career to be home with her because he pressured me to do so after I had her. I finally got a part time job back in my field and can move to full time when our daughter starts kindergarten. (His wealth has grown since we've been together and my world has shrunk.) Now he wants to move. I told him I'm not comfortable moving and leaving my job unless we are legally married. I've told him this before and he gets very angry. He says- ""you're all about the money, aren't you?"" But I'm thinking- what are we doing here? We're playing house but he doesn't actually want to marry me. I don't even know what my response should be because I'm so floored. He's not always a nice guy. We are already together for 10 years. He likes to tell pretend we are married and I make him look good. But he doesn't want to actually give me the security of being in a committed relationship? help

  
TDLR!: To summarize: We're together 10 years. Tell everyone we're married. Legally we aren't and when I tell him we should be legally married- he gets mad and says I'm all about the money. (He's not rich lol) What should I say to him?

"My(25F) partner(23F) is not good at talks, what can I do?","TLDR: Everytime i'm struggling my long distance partner doesn't know what to say or do, and now I just don't want to talk with her about my problems anymore, what should I do?

My partner is such a sweet person, a good student, a good friend and a good family member, I would say she is a good partner most of the time, but there is this thing:

There's nights when I struggle, because of my family, my studies or just im feeling like a horrible human being that is not loved, you know those nights ladies. I used to tell her when a day was bad and she asked me to keep telling her details about it. But when I finished she just... Didn't knew what to say. Not even an ""I love you"" or ""I'm here for you"", she just doesn't know what to do.

I felt horrible after that because it felt like i was trauma dumping on her or something like that and the lack of answers made me feel so shitty. I told her all of this and she said that she wanted to know about my thoughts on those bad days, and that she just isn't the type of person to know what to do when someone is crying or feeling bad.

So now everytime I feel bad i just, don´t give the details, I just told her i'm not ok and i'm gonna try to calm down by myself, and that's not weird to her because when she feels bad she likes to take a couple of days alone (not talking with me or friends). But I think this is getting worse.

Now on those bad night I can't think about her at all when i'm trying to get comfort, because she doesn't bring me any type of comfort in this situations, but our options are limited because we are long distance, is not like i could ask for a hug.

What could we do? How should I bring this subjet to her? I don't want to blame her or make her feel bad, but I know that if this keeps going i'm going to end up bitter with her.",1718165465.0,Evening_Guava4303,relationships
"31 F and my partner is 29M. We have a very good relationship, and recently I’ve been wanting to express my feelings of love to him.. but the problem is he doesn’t know what love is and never experienced himself giving it to anyone. TD;LR. My boyfriend and I have never said I love you to each other. ","I’m a 31F and my partner is a 29M. We’ve been together for 6 months thus far, and things have been going great!! We have never argued with each other or controlled each other ther over anything. He’s been loyal, understanding, affectionate and has valued our open communication throughout our relationship, which has made it a breeze for us to understand each other as individuals. 

I feel that the our relationship and bond is becoming so strong that I wanted to tell him I think I’m falling in love with him. After having a serious discussion about how he feels about the concept of love, he has explained to me he’s never experienced falling in love or being in love in a relationship. To give more detail, I am his second girlfriend and he has not been very successful in finding women to date him based on them making him feel like he was ugly or not masculine enough for him. It’s made him quite insecure with himself. He tells me he looks in the mirror and hates the reflection he sees, but he tries to move past it by acknowledging that he likes the person he tries to be everyday. 

His first relationship lasted about 5 years ago in his home country. He liked her, and they were each other’s first. But he tells me he never loved her and she never loved him throughout the duration of 5 years. It really doesn’t make sense to me? I feel like there’s something more hidden with that fact, or that he’s scared to love anyone. 

His actions makes me feel like he is falling in love with me. I can’t describe it, but I haven’t felt this certain about someone in a long time. However, he seems to get anxious when I bring up this kind of conversation. 

I need certainty that I’m not living an fantasy in my mind and I want to know if this is normal for anyone to be insecure to love and if it’s worth sticking around?

I [24F] don’t want to furnish a guest room for my mother [64F] in my new home.,"TL;DR 
Mom is very excited that I’m going to have a spare bedroom. I’m flooded with apprehension. I don’t know if my feelings are justified or not.
——————————————————————-

My partner [24M] and I are moving into a 1300 sq ft 2/2 townhome this week. Our current apartment is a snug 350 sq ft 1/1. 

I’ve been working from home out of our bedroom since mid-March. This hasn’t done wonders for my mental wellbeing. Moving into a bigger place has been a light at the end of the tunnel these last few months. 

I’m particularly happy about having a second bedroom, as my partner agreed that I should turn it into my home office. (I expect to continue working from home for quite a while longer.)

In my excitement, I told both my parents all about the new place as soon as our application was approved. 

(Context on my parents: My parents are divorced. They live in my hometown, roughly an eight hour drive away.)

When I mentioned the second bedroom in the townhome to my mom, she immediately began talking about staying in “her guest room”. I told her that I was going to turn the spare room into a home office, but she just replied “with a sleeper sofa!” She then began talking excitedly about how she’d be able to drive up and visit “often”. I didn’t know what to say, but something in my gut turned.

My mom works at an airport in a COVID hotspot. I have asthma that gets worse when I get sick, so I can’t take any chances with COVID. Knowing this, my mom has been trying for months to push me to visit her, and she’s been asking repeatedly if she can come visit me. (She has outright refused to quarantine herself for two weeks prior to seeing me.)

I put my foot down and told her that any travel was out of the question, and she kind of accepted that. She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn’t work, she asked if she could come visit in August to “see the new place” and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response.

At this point, I’m not even sure if I’d want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn’t get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she’s also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests. 

She’s constantly offering to give me money I don’t need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me *and* pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I’m never relying on her financially again.)

I almost think she’s generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don’t think she’s doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy.

In the past, when I’ve told her “no”, she has gone straight to guilting me. 
On one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner’s family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I “didn’t want her”, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn’t have room or an air mattress, so she’d have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way *back* home overnight, after having driven all the way *from* home that day. When we didn’t back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn’t sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation. 

My partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn’t want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he’s the reason why she can’t stay with us, but that’s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don’t want that.

***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings:
How do I tell my mother that my home office isn’t her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can’t come visit me in August?

I don’t even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I’m uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past.

She keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away. 

Reddit, please help?
—————————————————————

Edit: Wow, I’ve never had a post receive this much attention before. 
It’s interesting how many comments I’ve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me “you’ll miss your mom when she dies” and “she’s divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child”.
Here I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y’all for teaching it to me!)

- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad’s health isn’t great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn’t care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she “didn’t want a nappy-haired grandchild”.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she’s under stress, she can act in ways that don’t always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn’t want to save for a month to buy it.)
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn’t seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn’t allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we’re still trying to fix our relationship.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she didn’t step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to “break up” with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him.
- I’m uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don’t.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got “better” after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I’d get anxious again and “lose everything” that I’d built. I’ve been trying to make myself “well” for years. But I’ve never lost control of my life since I got it.
- I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had.

But yes. I’m guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I’ll never get back when *he* dies, but yeah.)

I may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but acquiescing to guilt isn’t it, chief. Thanks tho.",1595961966.0,sunshower-susurrus,relationships
"Good relationship of a few years, but not on the same page sexually with partner. How can I proceed?","My live-in girlfriend of about four years (30F) and I (33M) are simply not on the same page sexually — we’ve respectfully discussed our desires/expectations ad nauseum (without fighting or disrespecting one another). The jist of it is this: 

My desires:
1. Sexual intimacy 2-3 times a week
2. Some sort of spontaneity, variety in time of the day that we do it, how long we do it for, and mixing up positions.
3. Occasional intimate fun (showering together, sleeping naked together once in a while, etc.) 
4. A hope to continue being sexually active to some degree as our lives go on and we get married and advance into elderly age. 

Her desires:
1. Sexual intimacy once a week (on the weekend, usually Saturday night)
2. At night before bed, only one position (missionary) with me on top.
3. No interest in being naked together outside of our brief weekly intercourse (she’s against showering together, doesn’t like to sleep naked, etc.)
4. A belief that we’ll eventually get tired of being intimate and that sex will not continue into late middle age, senior life, etc.

She’s so funny, intelligent, smart, pretty, hardworking and easy to get along with. Our relationship is wonderful in so many regards, except with the above, which is arguably one of the most important things.

I don’t enjoy pornography at all, and have found it to be an empty and unsatisfying way to escape from the intimacy issues in my relationship. However, for all of the differences in our thoughts on sex listed above, I am really struggling and am desperately seeking a way to fulfill those needs. To be clear, we’ve repeatedly talked respectfully and expressed our specific sexual desires and boundaries. It has always been a problem, but she was not nearly as particular about it during the first year or so that we dated as she is now, after four years together.

I’m maybe looking for some sort of validation on my idea to pursue intimacy, romance and relaxation outside of my relationship with another person.

With all of that in mind, I’d appreciate honest opinions on whether pursuing someone on the side would ever be appropriate, given I let the side woman know what the deal is and kept it out of the relationship with my girlfriend. I’ve heard of studies that show people who occasionally cheat can end up being better partners in their relationships.

Yes, my girlfriend would absolutely be upset, devastated and heartbroken if she found out, but she’d have a similar reaction to porn if she knew I was using it. It feels like I’m stuck and need some help and advice. We can’t see eye-to-eye sexually, but the rest of our relationship is great and I’d ideally want to stay with her. 

Is there any justification for seeking the side woman and handling it on my own outside of the relationship? Or am I supposed to just languish with unfulfilling porn as a broken band aid? Or break up with my girlfriend and let all the other great things we have together go?

TL;DR my girlfriend (30F) and I (33M) are not sexually compatible, but we like every other part of the relationship. Should I consider pursuing a woman on the side to help with the missing piece of my relationship?",1713975236.0,WallabyThat3106,relationships
My boyfriend ruined my trip and demands me to say sorry again,"I’m a 24 years old woman dating this 25 years old guy for 1 year. 

I went to Italy for 4 days with my father, I was looking forward for these vacations because I was working part-time and writing my thesis at the same time. I work with telemarketing and it’s very stressful. 

For a bit of context, my boyfriend always had the tendency to make problems over nothing. He says I hurt him and makes me feel guilty because of very small things. He stresses me almost every week. Sometimes I think the reasons he gets upset are ridiculous but sometimes I wonder if I’m being too insensitive. However, because of this I’m starting to stop enjoying his company because it feels like a headache. 

When I was flying to Italy, he wished me a good trip which I replied him “thank you, see you there” with a kiss emoji. Then he answers “enjoy a lot” and sends me a screenshot that he used the money of my meal card to pay something and he sent me back the money. When the plane landed, I saw the messages and I replied “ok” and he reacts only with one emoji to my message without any reply.

I was busy looking for my luggage and finding the bus I have to catch to go to the hotel with my dad. He didn’t reply the message for the whole day, I thought that maybe he was waiting until night time to text me back since I was traveling and it’s hard to text while traveling. Then, my friends also wish me a good trip and give me suggestions of what to visit in the city which I replied but honestly I barely talked to anyone because I was so busy catching public transport, walking and finding the hotel. It was like this the whole trip, I was always visiting monuments and walking. 

At night time, he messages and tells me how angry he is with me because I never replied him and he saw me online the whole day, asking to whom I was talking. I told him he was the one who didn’t reply and I was talking with my mom and my friends because they wished me a good trip. He says I should’ve replied his message that says “enjoy a lot” but I only replied with “ok” to his screenshot. I apologised and said I was a bit busy, I was also expecting a message back from him. Honestly, I was surprised he didn’t ask me how was the flight. 

He proceeded to annoy me for the whole trip saying that he’s not my priority and I don’t give him enough importance and that I value more my friends. I tried to explain that I was busy and I barely talked to anyone, I just replied their messages, I don’t see anything wrong with that. He didn’t text me back because he didn’t want to. I mean, I barely have any friends, only 2, we barely hangout because we have busy lives and only talk by message. How is that giving more importance than my boyfriend? 

He also started asking me for screenshots of my conversations which I refused. He gets mad saying I don’t want to share anything and says “partners are supposed to share everything, there’s no privacy between them.” I don’t think he should demand me for screenshots of my whatsapp messages and he started demanding me for more apologies, saying I didn’t say sorry from heart. 

I didn’t reply his messages for a few hours because I was busy visiting the city. He posts on his status revengeful quotes, basically saying that karma will get me and he will watch me screwing myself because of what I did to him. I thought this attitude was do disgusting, he’s wishing me bad because of a very small thing. He knew I was looking forward to these vacations and still makes my life like hell, ruining my trip. I just wanted 4 days of peace and enjoyment.

Starting to resent my bf for not even thinking about marriage almost three years in.,"I’m (F31) have been dating my boyfriend (M29) have been dating almost 3 years. He is extremely passive in a lot of ways and I don’t think he’s really thought about marriage because the whole process stresses him out a lot (proposal, wedding, etc.)
Which ok fair, but for starters I told him when he first asked me out I didn’t believe in dating for years on end without marriage because I want to start building wealth together etc. I had said i wouldn’t wait longer than two years for a proposal, because imo if you don’t know by then, then we should stop wasting each others time. Also, I do NOT want a wedding. I want a marriage because like it or not it’s more secure for our society. I don’t care about a wedding at all. I don’t want to spend money on that. We’re just getting to the point in our lives where we’re both almost out of school (he just finished grad school and I’m almost done). We’re about to start making real career moves and I personally would not factor my relationship into any career moves I make unless I’m at the very least engaged. 
I also feel like it’s unfair (and toxic) to give him an ultimatum of “ok propose or I’m leaving”. 
Normally things are amazing but if he knew from the beginning of the relationship that I would walk out the door at 2 years and he would risk that because he get stressed out over things easily, is it worth staying? 

TL;DR 
Boyfriend too anxious to propose and is risking me leaving over it

Edit: for everyone asking why I didn’t walk out the door right at 2 years, it wasn’t an ironclad “oh I need to be married in two years”. It was me saying that eventually I want to get married and that I’m not one of those people who is fine dating for like 7 years before that happens (I know it’s fine for some people and that’s great, just wouldn’t be me). And I feel like you should have a reasonably good idea after 2 years if you’re serious and it’s heading that direction.

Edit 2: some people have asked what If I even like him or if he’s just mr. Good enough. My answer is that it’s too long to post everything I love about him. I’m very independent so basically I would only be in a relationship if I was truly crazy about that person. Which I am. But also sometimes love isn’t enough for stuff to last but hoping that’s not the case here

Thank you everyone for the really nice responses so far. It has helped me zero in on WHY I have this issue in the first place and why I’m looking for him to propose vs me just doing it and etc. I’m going to talk to him about it in a more light hearted way and see his response. 
Obviously there are always a few sh*t heads (it’s Reddit of course) but for the most part everyone has been really kind and the different view points are very helpful

Trying to respond to everyone because I’ve gotten so many nice and helpful responses. Thank you again everyone!  as a side note this has helped restore some of my faith in humanity as I was honestly expecting a lot of snark but it has been overwhelmingly sweet people 🥹


Edit 3: omg this is getting so f’ing long I’m sorry 
For people asking why marriage there are a lot of legal reasons people have already pointed out but on top of that I have dual citizenship so if we wanted to move to my other country it would be easier for him plus in academia it’s not uncommon for universities to do spousal hires so If you’re partner can’t find a job but the university wants you they’ll just pay for you both",1731772496.0,Advanced-Radio2256,relationships
Found boyfriend masturbating while talking on the phone with his boss.,"

Partner works from home, I came back and found him masturbating talking to his boss on the phone. He quickly shut the door and said he was doing work stuff. 

I couldn’t hear for a few seconds because the drier was on. It didn’t hear like anything was going on.

Then a few seconds later after I confronted him, I heard work talk going on. I turned the drier off, and he told me to turn it back on.

I confronted it about it and he said he had work calls to make. He said he was masturbating and then she called. He continued to do so while on the phone with her. He denies having a sexual relationship with her, attraction or phone sex (currently on present), he said he gets horny and masturbates a couple times a day.

I looked at his phone and it doesn’t appear to be a video chat. It looked like a phone call and he could have deleted it.

He was dismissive about the whole thing, and trying to tell me he was embarrassed and didn’t want to talk about it

I told him that doesn’t make him look good. He said I’ve been faithful for your for 8 years and I’ve never cheated on you. He got special permission for a remote job. And now I’m wondering if it was because there was an affair.

What should I do?


TL;DR boyfriend on the phone masturbating with his boss, while stating he had a regular work conversation. He stated he is not cheating, he just gets horny multiple times a day and does so even when he is talking to other coworkers. I don’t want to throw away 7 years.",1717015984.0,robogirl-anon,relationships

Hey Reddit, 

My OP didn't get much of a response, but I appreciate those who offered support/advice and wanted to give an update in case anyone was wondering. 


Originally, my weekend got a little more busy than I had planned, so I decided to move my coming out day until Tuesday. 

So, on Sunday, I called my mom to set up dinner (if I hadn't, I knew I would back out and not tell them) and my mom was feeling impatient I guess, because she was just like ""let's talk about it now"" and put me on speaker phone with my dad right next to her. 


So, I told them. And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked ""is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!"" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. 

We are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was ""Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname""

So I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. 

I also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. 

I hope you guys all have a great week!


Tl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!


**Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a ""sick fuck"" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**


**And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments. Thank you.**

**Edit 2: my first gold ever, thanks guys. You've been overwhelmingly supportive. Thank you all. You're wonderful humans.**",1500997170.0,Alwayswantedabeard,relationships
UPDATE: My wife of 15+ years friend-zoned me and wants no intimacy.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1eVrSXL54L

I wanted to give you guys an update of how the therapy session with my wife went this week. Not sure if this is helpful or not but I took many of the responses/comments/suggestions from my initial post and put together some things I wanted to discuss with our couples therapist to help us navigate some of the core issues that may be affecting this situation. 

One of the main things that is the ""buzz word"" of this has been the term ""resentment"" and it has been really eating me up inside knowing my wife keeps telling me she doesn't know why she's resentful or doesn't know why this is affecting her emotionally/mentally. I brought this up with our therapist once again and resurfaced the conversation about being married for so long (15yrs) and being together since we ere 14yrs old. Our long history of growing up and how having children when she was 19yrs old (me 20) significantly changed the trajectory of our lives. We experience sever poverty and many hardships in the process and we essentially had zero social life for the past 10 years because we were so busy raising babies (2 kids now ages 12 &14). She followed up with tons of questions directly mostly at my wife about her feelings towards this and 90% of the responses were very ""our kids"" focused. It definitely felt like she was afraid of saying ""yes it sucked"" because she would feel guilt or shame because it would imply she regrets the kids. I mentioned this in  the session and the therapist encouraged her to look at this outside of the lens of being a mother and to try to view it a bit more selfishly and individually and it was very eye opening. My wife mentioned that she was very frustrated with the fact that we did miss out on many things in life. She also was very clear in saying ""I do not think I missed out on other partners or dating or partying but I certainly lost all my friends."" This was huge because one of the big pieces that has caused a strain in our lives is how silo'd and isolated we've been (again busy raising kids). I followed up by reminding her that it's important to have good friends and to make time for herself and her friendships. 

For the past 3+ years, we've had multiple conversations about friends and how it is important to have them in life. Specially when you have similar peers that can help in many areas of life that perhaps we have no experience navigating and even simply for enjoyment. It has always been something my wife avoids, even  though she's always been someone who needs that external stimuli. The main reason for her not investing in friends or even herself has always been ""the kids."" Like I mentioned earlier in this post, 90% of the answers have to relate to ""the kids"" to some degree. 

At this point in our session I started to feel like there was a common denominator (the kids) in most of the frustrations and problems she was experiencing. So I simply asked her ""Do you think you may be upset at me because I'm responsible for these kids in the sense that I got you pregnant so young?"" I wasn't ready but she said that she was upset at me for that. She also followed up with the fact that she knows that's unreasonable because it ""takes 2 to tango."" I did feel like it was progress because it kind of gave us something to work on and help alleviate some of these ""burdens"" so we agreed to invest more time in nurturing good friendships both together and individually. 

Towards the end of the session, we began to discuss what actionable items we would take from this session. At this point, it was still all very ambiguous and blurry as to what the outcomes were. I was very direct and very forward in asking my wife what her plan is moving forward. (NOTE: I had decided prior to the session that should my wife say the same thing about being a coparenting roommate that I would take the 180 approach and essentially do me) She started basically saying the same thing, that she doesn't have any desire to be intimate or sexual with me as of now and that she loves me immensely and she feels bad for not being there for me (as mentioned in my first post). 

I also brought up the brief swinging that happened, to which for the 50th time said it wasn't a problem. I agree with her on this. This was something that was a ""mechanical"" approach for a solution to a problem that was very much in existent when we tried this. We (both) really have no issue to this. We know it happened, we tried it and mutually stopped and turned the page. 

I also brought up other life events that may cause resentment and really we ended up not getting anywhere else as far as the root for resentment which was discouraging. 

I then basically expressed to my wife that I will not be ok with that arrangement. I told her that I've really done everything I can and that this issue really has reached a point where it has nothing to do with me or require me to do anything that I'm currently not doing. I was very direct and saying that I will not be accepting this dynamic and that I need to be with someone who is actively involved in our marriage, works towards resolutions and is very much interested in maintaining an active intimacy and sexual relationship. I expressed how I am not going to be a ""convenience"" and that there was more to life than being roommates and coparents. I made sure she knows I love her dearly and that I do want this to work for the better. I also told her that I'm fully committed to this marriage so long as she is as well and that is she wasn't, its ok, however I will not be a part of something where these efforts are not reciprocated. I told her I have no plans of leaving, and I do not want a divorce, however, I made it clear that if this dynamic continues that divorce will be the only outcome. 

Of course tears were involved and it was a very bleak and sad ending to the session. Still nothing was said and I walked out very discouraged and very determined to start working on the 180 as soon as we left the room. It's painful and very difficult because much of the 180 requires you to be very short and cold and transactional. The saddest part is realizing, this dynamic already is very cold and transactional. 

Here is where it gets VERY interesting. I started working on implementing many of the 180 recommendations that same day. I mentioned to my wife that, ""hey, things are going to be a bit different moving forward. I'm going to honor her roommate/coparent dynamic without reproach and that it should be no mistake that I am not happy here and I am never going to be ok with it but I am done working on it if she wasn't going to work on it."" She agreed and went to bed. I started to build distance and started to basically focus on myself. Very short and transactional. She asked for help on some of her personal things to which I declined and it really shocked her. She was upset saying I was being petulant. I explained to her that, she is now fully in charge of her own life and her own issues. We didn't talk all day and we only spoke when necessary. Few days I keep this going and she's very visibly upset and stressed. I typically react to that with gestures of help or nurturing but I didn't this time. That night she was crying telling me she's stressed and she things something is wrong with me because I'm ""indifferent."" I simply listened, then I told her  that this is the dynamic she proposed and that I'm simply (much like her) taking care of myself and focusing on myself. I'm not going to lie, it has been VERY hard to be cold and distant because as I mentioned before, I love her and I wish I could hold her and love on her. However, I know this is somewhat manipulative in a way just to get her way and still keep me in the friendzone. So I've been staying the course. 

We're now going on a week of this 180 and let just say, there has been MANY changes on her side. I think she is starting to realize there is more to me than just ""friends and coparenting."" I sent her a text a few days ago essentially itemizing bills and separating the financial responsibilities 50/50 and SHE LOST HER SHIT. She basically told me it was ""out of left field"" to which I responded ""hey, friends go in 50/50 and as your friend I expect nothing less."" This was very eye opening because it gave me a glimpse of I'm really taken for granted and how her level of comfort and convenience at my expense is really overlooked. I pushed through anyways and basically told her that this is the new dynamic she asked for and that its still a ""bargain"" because she would have to be 100% if she was on her own. 

I'll wrap up with this. While the 180 has been working in many different areas, I am still very much sad about the overall situation. There have been MANY eye opening statements being said and realization that have not been pleasant to encounter. It has also sparked new energy and new efforts on her side as well. She's definitely seeking to talk to me more often and while its hard to turn down, I hope if things improve, this continues to happen. I've also noticed that she's making more time for herself aside from being a mom which is HUGE because she pretty much neglected herself for years. I'm very pleased seeing her be more herself. My hope is that as we work on ourselves, the marriage improves. There really is no telling at this point where this will go. We are very much cordial and amicable even to this day and that's a very good sign. Boundaries are set and expectations are very clear and I feel that no matter the outcome, I will be at peace with everything that has been done.  We're still going to continue the couples therapist until we either rekindle our marriage or end up in divorce. I feel like having this nonbiased third party really helps as a witness and as a guide through this. No matter what I will always love my wife, however, I will not participate in a sexless, intimacy less marriage because we both deserve better. 

Thank you all for all the kind words and recommendations and feedback. This will be my last post on  this topic and I wish you all the best. 

TL;DR: My wife friend-zoned me wants to just coparent at my expense but I started the 180 method to try and find a solution because she doesn't want to work on us which seems to be working on getting her out of her rut and helping me discover more about how she feels. Also, therapy is paramount and highly recommend to all couples. ",1715796901.0,themachucajr,relationships
"I [18M] convinced my sister [24F] to break up with her fiance [29M] who is a complete asshole. My parents and brothers now hate me, and after a big fight, they basically kicked me out and said they don't want me in their lives. My sister reciprocated by doing the same to them. What can I do now?","My sister was set to marry a guy who was a complete douchebag.  He seemed like a nice catch to any outsider; he was tall, handsome, very confident, a doctor, basically the sort of guy any woman would swoon over.  Unfortunately he was a sociopathic unrepentant narcissist devoid of any empathy who would take out his anger on anybody he felt beneath him and seemed to enjoy doing it.

You know how basically they say, don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you? My sister didn't pick up on that. I picked up on it early, this guy was really mean, would berate and insult people for the smallest thing and would lose his cool with anybody who looked at him the wrong way.  He started doing it to me, and I told my sister early on this guy's an asshole.  She was like ""nah, you two will eventually get along, you just got off on the wrong start"".  I told him I've seen him do that to other people, but she seemed to think ""oh, but he's nice to ME, I'm the SPECIAL one, maybe I can change him!"" Or I have no idea what she was thinking.

After about 2 years together, when they were engaged, the cracks were evident.  My parents loved him, his dad and my dad go way back, they both went to the same medical school together and have been close friends for decades.  Her fiance is also good friends with my two older brothers.  After 2 years, my sister was realising this guy was an asshole, he's always been an asshole, and he won't change.  There was a really painfully obvious example one day when we were having dinner, and my sister's fiance and my dad were having a discussion about something political.  My sister tried to offer her opinion into the discussion, and they both snickered, then this guy just started berating her and ripping into her infront of everyone, making her feel this small.  I could sense her pain, she was just quiet and just sat there taking it.  I was thinking ""what are you doing with this guy, he has no respect for you, he has no love for you.""  

Another time our family was at this dinner function where a lot of big people were around.  My sister's fiance completely left my sister alone at the table with me, and was sitting at this other table with two women, very obviously flirting with them semi-drunk. He just left her all alone at the table.  I asked her what was wrong, why was he ignoring her?  She told me they had had an argument earlier and this was his way of punishing her.  You see what I mean when I say this guy is a complete sociopath?

My sister and I are really close, and even though I'm younger by far, little brothers aren't devoid of wisdom, and I've been urging her from day 1 to break up with this guy before she gets in too deep.  Well now, that she'd spent two years with him and was engaged, she was obviously in too deep, and she used to tell me about all the outbursts he has, how he treats her with no respect.  We often had long discussions, just me and her, where she'd spill open like a can of beans and just divulge all the bullshit that he's put her through recently.  Sometimes she'd cry and I'd be there to help her out, but she still seemed to want to stick with him.  She actually convinced herself that he loved her behind all that horrible treatment, and couldn't pull herself to cancel the engagement what with our parents, his parents, everyone counting on it.  She knew they'd all say she's crazy, turning down this smart handsome doctor! Who does she think she is?!

I kept urging her to break up, but she stuck with the ""he'll change"" or ""he loves me deep down"" excuses.  It all came to a heads when one day she very publicly exploded at him.  We were having a huge dinner, both sides of our families, and I was sitting next to him.  He kept bullying me the entire night,  ""move your elbows over"" ""couldn't you wear something a bit more presentable?""  ""stop sticking your hand out like that, its rude""  ""don't you think you've had enough of that""?  If I asked him to pass a bowl or the sauce or something, he'd hand it over but then pull away and be like ""say please, say thankyou.""  He was smiling the entire time, laughing.  My two older brothers were also snickering, they didn't seem to mind this guy was publicly bullying me and having fun with it.

He and my dad started having one of their conversations again, and my dad started airing out all his general frustrations and disappointments regarding me, and they started both talking about my life openly in front of me.  Her fiance then turned to me and started openly lecturing me, and when I tried to ignore him ""hey, are you listening to me? whats the matter with you? your dad never taught you any respect?""

My sister just then basically exploded. She was sitting at the other side of the table (guessing she didn't want to be near him) but she was watching what was going on the entire time.  She just stood up and completely exploded, it was horribly frightening and scary.  She started shouting at him ""LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU, WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON HIM. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE"" etc etc.  I'd never seen her shout like that or explode like that in my entire life, it was absolutely terrifying.  We were all stunned silent.  She had tears in her eyes and ran upstairs crying.

I wanted to go upstairs to speak with her and comfort her, my dad was like ""where are you going?"" I told him I just wanted to see how sis was doing and check up on her, he was just like ""no you stay here, you stay seated"". So he made me stay seated until the end of the dinner. For hours my sister was up there I didn't even know how she was, my dad or mom didn't care, my two older brothers didn't care; I had to wait hours till everyone left before I could slip up and go talk to her.

She was an absolute mess, crying, mascara running all down her face like darth maul.  I told her she has to end this, she's going to jeopardise her entire life if she continues with this guy.  She has to do the painful thing now and rip off the bandaid.  I told her 'you might think its okay if he just does this to you because you can take it, but do you really want to bear his kids?  what if you have his kids, and then he starts treating them the same way?'

She finally agreed with me and said she would end their relationship and break up, it was the only option.  I just asked one thing, that she doesn't tell anyone that I convinced her to do it, because they all already seemed to have it in for me enough already.

Well the one thing I asked her to do, she couldn't hold up her end.  She still somehow let everyone know that **I** was the one who so graciously helped her make the right decision.  Of course this immediately made everyone hate me.  Aside from my dad occasionally going off at me and shouting, it was mostly just the silent treatment and people giving me glares, which was easy enough for me to bear.

My sister moved all her stuff over the next few days out of her fiance's place back into her own apartment which apparently she's gonna live in indefinitely now.  Her old room in our house has been converted into a billiard/pool table room anyway.

My dad and brothers were making my life hell for me, they blamed me for everything. My mom was occasionally nice to me but she's nice to everyone, I could feel her disappoint with me ran very deep.  She didn't offer any words of comfort or advice even though she knew my dad and brothers hated me right now.  My brothers basically flat out refused to talk to me aside from a few sentence words here and there, they didn't want to engage with me on any level even when I'd try to start conversations with them.  My dad I just tried to avoid so he doesn't have an angry outburst.

It all erupted eventually into a huge fight between me and him.  He was just shouting at me on and on and on, telling me I was a pathetic loser, disgusting.  My brothers told me how much they hated me.  My dad kept saying ""its not enough that you ruin your own life and turn yourself into a failure, now you have to drag your sister down to and ruin her life? why do you hate everyone and try to ruin our family?""  No matter how much I tried to explain how this guy wasn't a good guy, they seemed to think it was just a personal vendetta I had against him.  My brother told me that I didn't deserve to have my sister as my sister, I told him to go fuck himself.  My dad was like ""what did you say?"" I told him he could go fuck himself as well.  Admittedly, I lost my cool after hours of all of them attacking me and I shouldn't have said that.  My dad absolutely lost it with me and told me to get out of his house, he never wanted to see me ever again.

I tried to apologise, he basically just told me to get out, even though I was on the verge of tears.  I left the house and they locked the door behind me.

I called my sister, she came and picked me up and drove me to her place where I explained to her everything that had happened.  She told me she'd call them the next morning and talk to dad once he'd cooled down, and then he'd be happy to take me back.  I was still kind of teary and she comforted me and told me I shouldn't hate myself or take too seriously what my dad says, and I had been the only one brave enough to convince her to do the right thing.  Her place isn't big, but she let me stay there; her double bed is just wide enough for two people but it was cozy so we slept well and fine and the next morning she called up my parents home.  She wanted to try to talk to them reasonably and see if she could make ammends and get them to accept me back.

She told me to wait in the bedroom while she had a really long conversation with my parents over the phone, it went well over an hour, and there was a lot of shouting.  She told me she was stunned and she had spoken to both our parents and our brothers too, she said she couldn't believe it and was appalled at what jerks they were being.  They said they were serious about not letting me back into their home no matter how much she pleaded with them, and had said she had to go pick up my stuff from my parents house.

My sister drove over there and picked up whatever stuff would fit in the car, I didn't have that much aside from my laptop, books, and clothes, and brought it back.

She herself seemed horrified at the way they were acting and seemed to be barely able to believe it.  She tried calling them again later and the next day again; even though they had calmed down they were still adamant that I couldn't return no matter how much she tried to reason and plead with them.  She eventually got pretty angry with them too.  They were seriously trying to cut me out of their life.

My sister told me as a result she was going to cut the rest of our family out of her life.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she told me she does have to and she wants to.  She said she was permanently cutting off all relations and contact with our father, mother and both brothers until they apologised for the way they treated me and accepted me back into their family.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she insisted its the least she could do.

Instead of making me feel good, it just made me feel worse and more guilty, like I was responsible for the permanent fracturing of our family.  So now my sister has completely cut herself off from the rest of the immediate family and cut them completely out of her life.  She told me I'm welcome to stay with her and live here indefinitely, as long as I want, even though I barely have any money and I'm a full time student so there's not many ways I can compensate aside from doing chores.  She said now that shes actually seriously completely cutting her family off, she'd like to have the one remaining family member close by. 
So here I am now. I honestly feel responsible for this whole mess of a situation. I think its good that I helped my sister get out of that horrible relationship with that awful guy, but now look at the fallout.  I'm cut off from the rest of the family, they hate me and don't want anything to do with me, and I'm not welcome back there.  My sister has done the same to them, cutting them all off, she said even for the rest of her life if need be.

It all feel so horrible and terrible, I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other.  I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them but it seems so unlikely especially since nobody seems to want to and I'm at the centre of it all.  Any ideas for what I can do to help heal this huge rift and reconciliate my family? Or should I just leave things the way they are and get on with my life, for better or for worse?  Nothing I can do to help mend the situation?
   
**tl;dr**: **Sister was engaged to a massive narcissistic douchebag who my dad seemed to really like.  I convinced her to break up with him, now my dad hates me and blames me for everything.

UPDATE: When I 34f told boyfriend 36m I frequently feel judged/scrutinized by him he told me there are “millions of things” he doesn’t say. Do I need to change my perspective or are we incompatible?,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/go2t88/when_i_34f_told_boyfriend_36m_i_frequently_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

First, thank you to everyone who responded to my original post. I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn’t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.

I told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn’t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way. 

Those first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.

Our relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the “innocent” insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.

In the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible. 

I’m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn’t talk to him like a normal person .

I can’t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.

This comment from my original post rings true:

“It seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.

Those people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.”

The BS certainly didn’t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.

I still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn’t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.

It was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It’s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies. 

There is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing. 

Why have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I’ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn’t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I’m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I’m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.

We have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up. 

After a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I’m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I’m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I’m making the right decision  so I know I’ll be able to handle whatever happens.

Again, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward. 

TL;DR I wasn’t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.

Oh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.",1612120448.0,throwaway52120,relationships
How to be a good partner [38m] to someone [28m] whose life isn’t going very well?,"
My 28 year old partner of 5 years is beautiful, talented, and well educated, but things aren’t going well for him lately. He has not been able to find a good job in the two years since he finished his masters. He has financial struggles. His family abroad is quite unhappy about his homosexuality. He’s struggling with depression and body image issues. He has trouble making and keeping platonic friends. He got very sick earlier this year for a whole month. He was recently verbally assaulted on the street by someone screaming homophobic and racist things. He hates our city. 

I’m doing my best to be supportive and helpful but obviously I cannot solve these problems for him. 

My question is more general: how to be a good, supportive partner to someone who is down on his luck and going through tough times? Who is depressed enough that he can’t always show up in a pleasant way? 

I want to help him get through these things, but as mentioned many of them are out of my control. Also it’s hard to not take it personally when his disillusionment with the world turns into grumpiness or nastiness toward me, or when he criticizes me for repeating the same kinds of support/advice again and again in response to his issues. 


TL;DR - my partner can’t seem to find any success or stability in life, and I’m looking forward to be supportive, and also somehow to bolster my own defenses against taking his bad moods personally ",1712792932.0,Brightonas,relationships
UPDATE: My(30M) GF(32F) of 6 months has changed her behaviour recently and I want to leave,"OP: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5oop6/my30m\_gf32f\_of\_6\_months\_has\_changed\_her\_behaviour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5oop6/my30m_gf32f_of_6_months_has_changed_her_behaviour/)

Some things I want to address first:

* I work at the same place I have done for years because of my anxiety, I know how to do everything at my job and it helps me feel grounded and not worry. When I said I'm basically a manager, I mean that I do sometimes fill in shifts and responsibilities for them, and we have talked about me officially being manager before, but it's not what I want. I don't want to take my work home with me and never be able to switch off like I see some of them do. That said, I do want to have some more ambition in my life going forward, and I am going to be looking at other ventures.
* My clothes: My band clothes are now back at my house, I still have the new clothes we bought as I paid for a lot of them and I plan to continue wearing them too. I can see what she meant by wanting me to wear new clothes, I just didn't like her end goal or the way she went about it. For the people thinking I dress like those goth people dancing under a bridge, I don't. It's usually just a band tee/jumper with some normal jeans, I'm not a teenager, just a 30yo who still loves the same band haha. (No hate to those dancing goths, I love that meme)

OK so on to the main story. I took advice from some of the responses to the OP, we live separately so there wasn't any issues with leases, but I did change my lock as I had given her a key a few months ago. As for the breakup, it didn't go well, but it did go at least. I was at home thinking of how to do it, which cafe/restaurant I was gonna do it in etc. She finished work and came to mine without any prior discussion, not out of the ordinary to be fair. Anyway she could tell something was off, and because I'd been thinking about it all for hours I was 150% sure I wanted to do it so just did it here instead. I first told her that I had lied about donating my clothes and that I'd actually taken them to work instead. She was angry and calling me a liar and everything. I apologized for it, and tried to explain that I felt a lot of unfair pressure to get rid of them when I didn't really want to and my collection wasn't hurting anyone. I don't really feel that the argument was fair, and I feel that her actions made me lie to her, but I hate saying stuff like that so I just left it and moved on. 

I then told her I was really annoyed about her calling my boss, she said she was sorry but I should be a manager, I said that's OK and she looked confused but accepted it I guess. Then I just said I didn't wat to be with her anymore because she actually had given me a second to speak. She looked shocked and asked me what I meant. I just said I didn't want to be with her anymore, and that I wanted her to leave and would be changing my locks but was open to calling to messaging about picking up her stuff. She said stuff like we don't have to break up but I kept saying my mind is made up and technically we already had, she called me pathetic as she walked out the door and slammed it behind her. This was the other day, I haven't heard from her but I sent her a message about picking up her stuff, there isn't much of it here so maybe she doesn't want to?

Anyway, since then, I called my boss to explain that situation and be wary of any contact from her, we've worked together for years and we're good friends so he was very understanding and said if I need help in anyway he'll try to provide it. We go for drinks often with other colleagues so I'll explain it all to them there probably. 

As for me, like I said above, I do want to work on myself a bit, partly because of the things she said, but not for the same reasons, just for me to grow a bit in terms of work experience and fashion sense. I'll be buying more 'smart causal' clothes to wear as well. I don't think I'll ever fully stop wearing the band clothes though hahahaha. I don't quite know what I want to do in terms of work, but I have the experience of team work and leadership from the store which I think is usable and transferable to other jobs too. 

I'm feeling weird, but OK, it feels great to have acted decisively, I haven't felt sad yet, not happy either just relieved mostly. Some of her stuff is still here and it feels weird to see it knowing it'll never be that way again, I don't know how to describe that feeling. Anyway I've spoken to friends about it and will be seeing them soon. Idk what she's been up to or what she'll do, not sure if I want to, there's nothing left for me with her anyway. 

Just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words in the OP, it felt really good to know I wasn't being treated fairly and I wasn't just being stupid like she said. Some even messaged me with similar stuff or how much they liked their partners with similar habits to my band clothes which was really nice. One of the reasons I still wear the band tees is sometimes other fans spot them and we'll have a nice conversation about it and always end the conversation smiling haha, it's just nice. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR GF came to my house and it took an hour or so but I broke up with her and she left. Locks have been changed and clothes returned, thins are weird but definitely better. I'll be working on myself but doing it purely for me not for her or anyone else. Thanks again for kind words and advice everyone, hope you enjoyed the story.",1638893093.0,PantWearer123,relationships
"My bf [31M] has been ranting about orange peel theory for days, I [25F] am getting uncomfortable and want him to stop","We've been together for about a year and a half, I am previously widowed (relevant later). Prior to our relationship he's never had an adult relationship, so for a while I was trying to understand that he would make awkward mistakes and we would have to work through them. Lately he's been bringing up orange peel theory quite a bit, sending me tiktoks about why it's unhealthy and bad for your relationship and then later mentioning it in conversation again. It's essentially someone asking their partner to peel an orange and if they peel it for you they pass, and if they don't or complain about it it's a bad sign or whatever. 

I love this man, but this is starting to hurt my feelings and the way he so obviously feels attacked is making me feel gross. I don't know why he's so offended if I'm being honest, this is not a thing that happens for us. I don't test him and I'm always respectful and considerate to him. I would say I do a lot of things for him with or without him asking just because I like making his day better and his life easier. Him staying so heated about this is making me wonder if he feels resentful for being asked to do anything for me, and I have a few past examples that keep popping into my head. 

I had a pet that my husband had gotten for me die before a big event several months ago. I was devastated, and he offered for us to miss but I told him it would be good to get my mind off of it for a few hours. We had a bit of a walk to get there and because I was crying a bit he asked if he could do anything to make me feel better. I'm a big sap and it makes me smile, so I asked him if he could ""romantically ask"" to hold my hand. He just said ""Can I hold your hand?"" and I laughed and said ""More romantic than that!"" This made him mad and he roughly grabbed my hand and started walking. I started tearing up and he told me I was being mean, only apologizing because by the time we got to the venue I was crying hard despite trying to hold it together. 

Another time he had gone to visit his parents and wanted to leave early. My home was closer than his apartment, and I was having a horrible weekend. I was sick and very down. He mentioned he was heavily considering coming to stay with me and I told him I would appreciate it as I was struggling and missed him. Despite him being very positive about it just before, this flipped some kind of switch in him and he said ""I'll come, but I'm leaving FIRST THING in the morning so don't ask me to stay longer."" I got hurt by this and told him to not come at all then as I hadn't even suggested that, and suddenly he's ""Oh no, but I want to be with you. I want to support you, baby. Please let me."" and eventually I relented and he ended up staying into the afternoon 🙄 

I have several other instances of him suggesting he wants to help or be kind to me, but the second I take him up on it or ask for him to alter it slightly he's angry. Then he'll tell me that we just need to ""communicate more"" while he doesn't listen to me and only wants to do things on his own terms. Which is fine if he would say that, but he always tries to spin it back on me victimizing him somehow. 

I'm tired and the now daily mentions of how annoying and rude this trend is to him is getting hurtful, but I have no idea how to address this with him without it being interpreted as me being mean. What can I say? 

**tl;dr my bf hates orange peel theory and keeps bringing it up despite that not being how our relationship operates. I would honestly say that I communicate my needs and wants to him and he gets just as upset about that. I'm trying to figure out how to communicate that this is not something I want to continue going over unless he feels it's genuinely relevant to us, partly because it's giving me a bad vibe about him.**

**EDIT to say I'm really appreciative to everyone who has taken the time to comment and I have/will read all of them. I know this is not a great situation and I have a lot of conflicting feelings about it. I do sincerely love my bf and I also acknowledge that it's not healthy for me. I'm not sure that I'm at the point of leaving (I know), although I've started to become disillusioned. I'll be checking out all of the resources suggested to me and I will see where it goes from there.**",1705710353.0,ThrowRA78562,relationships
"I (34F) called the guy I am dating (32M) ""decent"" and things became cold. Can I salvage this?","I had been dating this guy, Alex, for a couple of weeks. He seems like a good guy with a good head on his shoulders, always polite and kind, good job and clear goals.

Last week we were on a dinner date and this is where I think I messed up. We were talking about our past experiences and expectations. Alex is looking for a long-term partner, and so do I. I mentioned how I am sick of arrogant and narcissistic guys like my exes, and said that Alex seemed like a decent guy and nothing like them.

The atmosphere kinda changed. Alex said ""Glad I'm decent"" and excused himself to the bathroom. When he came back he stopped initiating conversation, got very vague in his replies and when he took me home he declined to come in for a coffee saying he had an early start the day after. He said he would love to have me over for lunch though, maybe next week.

It's been a week and I have been initiating all texting with him, he's been polite but stopped mentioning hanging out together. I think I turned him off with my ""decent"" comment, but I meant it in a positive way, a good, kind hardworking guy.

I would hate to miss on someone like him, should I explain myself to him and try to fix things?

My roommate (28F) constantly violates my (29NB) and my partner's (29NB) boundaries. How can I salvage what's left of a once-good friendship?,"Hi all!

I (29NB) have been living with a group of high school friends for about seven years (29M, 29NB, 28F). Things were fine in the beginning, but after COVID-19 things have been difficult with one of my roommates (28F).

She is clingy, emotional, and somewhat manipulative. I think this is in part due to how she was raised — she uses techniques her parents use/used to get under our skin. She also has treatment-resistant depression and a learning disorder. She constantly steps over my boundaries and forgets things we have discussed mere days after discussing them.

Worse yet — she doesn't understand the difference between friendship and romance. We believe she is aromantic. She needs to feel needed. My partner (29NB) was physically abused as a child and is only comfortable being physical with me. She asks why things are different, asks to be invited on our dates, and even asked if she could come along on our honeymoon. Even after my partner expressed discomfort, she kept asking my partner things like ""will you hold my hand"", ""will you cuddle me"", etc. which my partner is not comfortable with. At all. And I'm not either. She craves physical intimacy with those she feels close to, but asks again and again after being told no. This is actively damaging our (me + 28F's) relationship.

Again, these things weren't so apparent until recent years and have only gotten worse. Her therapist told her she needs to get other friends — so, for a time, she asked to go along with me on outings with my friends. However we all have a shared interest she does not have (competitive games) and she gets very angry when she loses. She's expressed to me she feels like an idiot when she loses. After a while of this I asked her to reach out for friends elsewhere because she was making these outings intensely unpleasant. Outside of this she has not made any friends. She only has her roommates.

A long time we dreamed about the four of us buying a house. After this type of behavior I am no longer interested. In addition, my partner and I want to raise kids together someday and we do not think she is a good influence.

The worst part of this is that I don't think she is a bad person. I think she has a good heart and she has a lot of love to give... but the way she gives it is too much. It's not right. I'm slowly reaching my breaking point. She violates my partner's boundaries and my own. But she's genuinely just forgetful, depressed, and anxious.

My question is: is this situation (and our friendship) salvageable? She doesn't seem to be genuinely putting in the work, even when she says she'll keep working on it. She gets defensive when I bring up something she's done wrong. I would do a lot to make this work out as we have been friends for a long time.

And if it isn't salvageable, how do I make living with this person bearable for the remainder of my lease?

TL;DR: One of my roommates has been constsntly violating my and my partner's personal boundaries (both physical and emotional). However, she struggles with treatment resistant depression and a learning disorder that has been preventing her from making solid progress on respecting these boundaries. We were good friends for a while and I want to salvage what I can of this relationship without feeling resentful — or at least ride it out until the end of our lease.

My (28F) boyfriend (32M) told me a “white lie” for almost 3 years and I’m not sure if it‘s a red flag,"
TL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years told me a series of “white lies” that to me, seem more serious. Can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if this is actually indicative of a bigger problem.  

I’ll try to make this as short as possible but it’s going to be long as hell because there is so much lying going on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, living together for 2. We have a pretty good relationship, obviously with ups and downs but we make it work and are happy. 

A little background on me/my boyfriend for context: 

I come from a single-parent home. My father was absent. My mother was/is by no means perfect, but she did her best with what she had. We were poor. Life was never easy for us but we had each other. Since I was pretty young, I’ve wanted to pay her back someday. I’ve worked incredibly hard to be able to do so. I help her financially as much as I can and regularly pay her bills/send her cash. I’m also her only living child now as my brother passed away 5 years ago which basically left me to help her. I don’t care, I love my mother, and the right thing to do is to help her when she needs it. But is is stressful. 

This is relevant because my boyfriend described coming from a somewhat similar past, and it is something we have bonded over. Having the mutual experiences seemed to bring us closer. He told me he also helped his parents financially, and we would often vent to each other about the stress it brings. I am not one to confide in many people, so having someone who I felt like actually understood me, was meaningful to me. 


So here is where the lies come in and I need someone to either tell me I’m not crazy and this is fucked up, or that I am crazy and this isn’t a huge deal. I’m fine with either. 

When we met, my boyfriend lived in a condo in a pretty swanky part of the city (I live in the US northeast). He told me he owned that apartment/condo. I found this to be interesting/odd because he was 28 at the time and I know this property is upwards of $650,000 on the low end and he was in an entry-level job for only like 2 yrs so the numbers just didn’t really add up. Whatever, maybe he’s good at saving? 

But then, since living together, I never once saw a piece of mail for a mortgage payment, electric bill, taxes, nothing. Not for 2 whole years. Very odd.

Also, when we started living together, he didn’t have his room rented out in the former apartment yet so he was still responsible for that portion of the rent. He would send a Venmo payment to his mother on the first of every month for his portion. I don’t own property, but I can’t think of a scenario where I would Venmo my mother to pay the mortgage on a property I supposedly own. Getting more odd. 

He would then go to his parents house for an afternoon and come back really upset. Usually when I would ask why, it was because they were having financial problems and he needed to help them out. I totally understood this and supported him. He literally has cried on my shoulder about this many times. 

He tried to start a company years back and ended up getting into debt somehow. He told me this debt was $17,000 and that he paid it off. I’m confused because I met him only 2-3 years after the supposed debt accrued/company dissolved and it was already paid off? He told me when he moved back home after the business failed, he was $17k in debt and living at his parents house working at a minimum wage job. How someone with a minimum wage job pays off that much debt in 3 years, I’ll never know!

We got into a fight a few weeks ago and I finally had enough and confronted him about these things. Long story short - he doesn’t help his parents, they actually pay his phone bill, and this was all a lie. He doesn’t own that apartment, he didn’t pay off that debt from his company (he initially told me his parents helped pay it off and then like 3 mins later “came clean” and said that his business partner paid it off so I have literally no idea what the truth is there) and if anything, in my eyes, his parents are the ones who are financially supporting him.

So now, I’m dating a 31 yr old man who doesn’t pay his own phone bill, was lying to me and/or completely fabricating aspects of his life for 3 years, and then when confronted about it, continued to make up lies and then came clean about them 5 mins later. I’m obviously concerned that he could lie for this long, about fundamentally important things like our values, and so on.

I sincerely thought I would marry this man, he seemed to understand me like no one else and to be a truly caring and genuine person. Now I’m having a hard time rationalizing actually planning a life around someone who would not only lie about their background and family etc. but also financial aspects. Aside from that, I now can’t tell what is the truth and what is a lie. I’ve also noticed other things he has lied about, called him out on it and he has denied it outright to my face. I see this as a form of gaslighting as I KNOW I’m not wrong but he is trying to convince me otherwise.

Am I overreacting? Is this a white lie that went haywire? Or is this actually a series of complete and utter bullshit used to manipulate me? And also, is it insane for me to actually consider a life with this man? Any advice is appreciated.",1596698944.0,Intelligent_Ad3412,relationships
Do I divorced my husband or am I being dramatic?,"I (26F) have been married to my (30M) husband Dante for two years now, together for six years now. Not very long into our relationship I got pregnant with our first child. Dante was really happy about the pregnancy and we were inseparable ever since. (He believes that whatever is meant to happen will happen). He has been my best friend and confidant through all these years together. We grew together. When my son was just over a year old, Dante proposed. Needless to say but I said yes. We were a family but in no rush to marry. Three years pass and we finally tie the knot. Life is great. We communicate well, voicing our thoughts and feelings easily. We do a lot of things together. He brings me silly little presents every other day. Takes our son on mini-trips so I can have some alone time. Truly, we were best friends.

I fell pregnant with our baby girl (second child) days before our first wedding anniversary. Once again, we were both excited. The pregnancy,  sadly, was horrible. I had a lot of complications and could barely function most days without throwing up air (dry heaving isn't fun guys). He tried to help where he could but then tragedy struck. 
Dante lost his job and my income (I work from home for myself) couldn't even begin to support our needs. We moved in with his mother and sister into a house three times larger than the one we had been in (relevant later). Things had always been tense between me and his mother (think emotional incest on her part, he has to meet all her demands all the time or she throws fits). MIL runs a small business and Dante helps her with everything in it, doing most of the work for her, leaving me home alone with my son and my work. No big deal. I need to be the bread winner now. We are partners, after all.
Off the bat I'm expected to clean the house every day, no help from anyone else. I have to look after our son and do all of my work. If I fail to clean even a fraction, I get cussed out because who else is supposed to clean? Keep in mind I am still very sick from my pregnancy. 
I take the heat, trying my best to put on multiple hats at a time, although I'm struggling. Dante is looking for work to get us out but work is scarce. So he devotes his time to his mother and the business, seeing as it feeds us. I'm fine with him being there.
If it just wasn't for our breakdown of communication. No longer am I allowed to voice my concerns or feelings. I have to be picture perfect and happy all the time. No complaining because ""what am I supposed to do about it?"".
Finally, our baby is born and I think, wow, I'm gonna get better now. Nope. Wrong. Because being a fucking woman is just AMAZING. I get body slammed by postpartum depression. 
I stop working for three whole months because of everything. Baby. House. Cleaning. Kid. Depression. I was overwhelmed and didn't know what to do anymore. No help from hubby. Or the kind of help where he takes the baby to LET ME take a bath and then drops the baby with his mother. Our communication is non-existent by this point, not for a lack of trying on my part. He just doesn't want to listen or learn, I guess. I want to slit my wrists but resist the urge because I feel I'm just being dramatic. 
Except... he does the opposite of what I like to do for our second anniversary. Instead of just me and him, maybe with the kids, out for an hour or two, no. What little money he gets (government funding) he goes and organizes a BBQ with the entire family. Ladies and gentlemen, his mother doesn't like me, his sister is odd towards me and I am an INTROVERT. He put zero thought into our anniversary (thinks he just wanted to please his mom but who knows, right). An hour. That's all I wanted from him. To know me for an hour. Even if we just went to a playground for that damned hour. 
Fast forward to now. He has made a friend of sorts with his own business. My husband ""works"" for him. Has been for the last month but we have yet to even talk about any form of payment, let alone saw a penny. I'm still cleaning and cooking and taking care of two kids now. I barely have time to work although I started a month ago again as well. So I sit until the early morning hours to work because I can't get anything done. 
Whilst the rest of the family just carries on like normal, I feel like I'm drowning. I don't get any help from him anymore. We barely talk because he works late most nights and when he doesn't and he is home, he is on his phone or sleeping. Right now my income is the only one that we can say with confidence that we are getting in but I can barely work with everything else. 
I'm exhausted, emotionally and physically. I look at him and wonder who this man is. I wonder how we got this far... 
I'm so alone and so bitter and tired. Would I be better off on my own? My parents are more than willing to help me. They beg me sometimes to just let go and go to them. But I cling to him because when it was good it was great. 
I love him more than anything. 
Should I just divorce him and go to them? Help.
TLDR: I want to divorced my husband because I feel like I'm not getting enough support from him and I'm exhausted. But I feel like I'm being too dramatic because of my postpartum depression.",1733932944.0,CookieReal53,relationships
"UPDATE TO: I [21/M] have been looking for my sister [18/F] since 2014. I found a way to contact her last night, but I'm not sure how to do it.","This is an update to [this post I made in January last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uknz2/i_21m_have_been_looking_for_my_sister_18f_since/). Not many people saw it but I figured I'd update anyway because I got some good advice and, I don't know, the outcome might be something good to read while having a poo or whatever. Fair warning, this is a lot longer than I expected it to be.


**tl;dr (for the original)**: Sister has been involuntarily no contact with me since my parent's divorce. She lives with my narcissistic mother who would do anything to make sure I never see her again. I've found a way to contact her and I want to do it, but I don't want to step in her life and fuck it up for her. What's the best way to proceed?

---

**Update:** Well, I'm 23 now. Finished university, starting a real job, Dad and I no longer have depression, life is pretty good. As for my sister, a few interesting things happened to say the least. Firstly - I took the overall consensus from the original post and didn't make any attempt to contact her. I did drunkenly check her the page from time to time to see if anything had changed, and I found that I'd be unblocked on my main facebook account. Probably around August that same year, my sister rang my aunt and said she wanted to arrange a meeting with her and her son (our cousin, obviously). My aunt immediately rang my Dad and I and told us the good news, we were both uncertain about how we should take it but overall we were pretty happy. 

They all meet up and apparently my sister has also been kicked out of our mother's house for some reason or another and is staying with a friend, and she hasn't spoken to my mother for over a year (at this point in November). The story goes that my mother and her new victim managed to ostracise themselves from all their friends down there and my mother took out her aggression on my sister, so she stormed out and turned up teary-eyed at this friends house and has been living with them ever since. She asked about me and my father, if we were doing well, and if we 'hate her'. Obviously my aunt assured her that we definitely don't. My sister says that she wants to get in contact with the both of us but she wants to take it slow and she didn't know how we would react. In my view that's completely understandable\*.  That's interesting point #1.



^\*Just ^(as a side note, my mother once smacked my sister in the face for wasting a tampon when she was 12. I obviously am not completely familiar with that uniquely female experience but I did get the joy of hearing that moment unfold - just for an idea of the type of person my mother is and what she did to us both as kids.)


**Interesting point #2** happens when my sister goes, with her new boyfriend, up to visit our Nan\*. Another cousin of ours (big family) is also present for this meeting. My cousin tells me that my sister told our Nan that it had been 'a few months' since she had last spoken to our mother, which is quite a bit different to 'over a year ago'. Whatever, maybe my Aunt misremembered the meeting. However, my cousin did say that she got a very 'off' vibe from my sister, and to paraphrase her own words heavily, 'you would think [Sister] had last seen us all last weekend - not 5 years ago. She walked in to [Nan's] house like she owned the fucking place. She didn't really say why she was getting in contact with us and not [you or her father] other than she ""wasn't ready"", and she didn't really say why she hadn't spoken to her mother either. I don't know, I wasn't happy with it at all, and we were all thinking that you two [my father and I] should be in that room, not us. But maybe [your mother] has made me too paranoid.'

^\*My ^(Nan is my maternal grandparent. I phone her as often as I can which isn't as often as I would like it to be admittedly and I know I'll kick myself for it. I digress - every time I do phone her, she always asks about my Dad and his new partner, and sends them both Birthday cards, Christmas cards, so on. To me it just speaks volumes about the type of person my Mother is when her mother is more concerned about the wellbeing of her ex-husband and his new partner. Just tryna get this point home to any doubters.)

**#3** occurs when I find out that my sister asked my Nan for some money to help her out with University and not living with her Mother anymore. My Nan, being the lovely little 86 year old Welsh sweetheart that she is, gave her around £2,000. Now, I'm happy to be proven wrong here, but asking for £2,000 within a few hours of reconnecting with family that you haven't seen or made contact with for *five years* is very strange. I find out about this, because around November my Nan called me - because she had promised me an update on the situation - to tell me that for about a week after my Sister met up with them all, they had been in regular contact via phone and Facebook. Since that week - nothing. Unreturned voicemails, Facebook messages left on read, my sister had taken the money and fucked off. I spent the day reassuring my Nan that she hadn't done anything wrong, and she definitely wasn't the idiot she thought she was for giving my sister the money. 

**#4** is the least interesting, but you'll be pleased to know that my ramblings end here at least. It should go without saying that since the first meeting in August with my aunt and her son, neither my Dad nor I have had any direct contact with my sister. On Boxing day, my sister *finally* calls my Nan and wishes her a merry Christmas. My Nan says thanks and hangs up. In January, on my Nan's 87th birthday, my sister calls up and wishes her a happy birthday, and also mentions that she's having some money problems. My Nan rolls her eyes and hands the phone to my Aunt who buys my Sister's sob story hook, line, and sinker, and rings me to tell me the, quote unquote, ""good news"" and that ""it's different this time, she really wants to see you"". 

Around May (which is my Birthday month btw), my sisters sends a text to my Aunt to see if she has any old pictures of her. My aunt says she doesn't, but that me and my Dad might (which we do). My sister sends a text back saying that she will get in touch with us. 

I know this is gonna come as a complete shock, but it's been radio silence since and in all honesty I'm fine with that. To me, it's crystal clear who my sister has grown up to be like. Toying with family members emotions, treating her own presence as a gift and using it to manipulate money out of people, inconsistent stories about her relationship with the one person she knows would be a deal-breaker if the rest of the family knew was still involved, and terrible at hiding her true intentions. Will she ask me for the photos? Probably not. Unless she gets really desperate and exhausts all other avenues for exploiting money out of people with pity stories, but even she knows that I know exactly who that money is going to. My mother knows that she's not in my Nan's will at this point. 

If she does want to meet up, I will bring the photos with me. Part of me wants to bring two envelopes - half of the photos in one envelope, the other half shredded up in another, and depending on how well the meeting goes depends on which envelope she gets. I won't do that but it the thought of being that petty is very tempting. 

I'm not holding my breath. She was 14 and I was 17 the last time I saw her; she's turning 21 this year and I was 23 in May. I've had my years of anger and grief and done my time with depression, I've hurt many people and many relationships along the way. I'm still learning what's normal and what isn't, but on the whole my life is split up into *before* and *after*, and for the most part my sister lives and will remain in the *before*. Somewhat because I want to maintain the memory I have of her and not taint it by knowing what she has become, somewhat because I'm not ready to go through what I overcame again. I've accepted my role in the universe as the recipient of bad karma to make up for all the good karma that randomly happens to other people. I'm okay with that; for the first time in my life, I've been the one in control. As for my attitude to her and my mother, the best word I could adequately use to describe it is ""ambivalent"". They could win the lottery and be on the news tomorrow or they could get hit by a bus - my reaction would probably be the same. 

 To everyone else out there with estranged parents or other family members - the one thing I learned is that estrangement is the best thing they'll ever do for you.



**tl;dr**: I didn't contact her, and it turned out to be a good thing, but not for the reasons I thought.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments, I did my best to reply to everybody but given the response to the original post I had no idea this would get so much attention. 

* To the people that shared their similar stories, I hope you're all keeping well and staying positive and making the most out of what you've been dealt in life. Hard times make strong people. 

* In reference to my idea of ripping up the photos, that was always only ever half-serious. I wouldn't do something like that; it's petty, wouldn't be fair to my sister, and would only give me short term satisfaction in the form of a pathetic 1-up. I realised that before writing this post 

* In reference to the 'bad karma' line, I actually think I'm a very lucky man all things considered. I'm where I want to be in life, I have a fun and happy and stable family around me, and I'm confident in the person I've become. That line is a glimpse into my personality - some people got that, some people were genuinely concerned for me which I do sincerely appreciate. The black dog never really stops chasing you, but I get a much warmer feeling from being able to laugh at a universe that is seemingly constantly shitting on you than I do from pretending that everything is okay; that's what I meant by that line. 

Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to read, it felt good to get this off my chest and know that a lot of people think I'm making the right moves. A good amount of people made the fair comment that my sister is still young and still possibly under my Mother's influence. I appreciate those people taking the time to give feedback and advice, but ultimately my life had already moved on. I made peace with the fact that I may never see my sister again long before the events I've detailed out here, and when this all kicked off the closure and acceptance I had moved on from began to unravel. I'm not ready to go back into dark days off of a risk that everything might be okay. Yes, in the future we may reconnect, but for now I am focused on my own life and am content with taking some of the rare happy memories I had of my family in my childhood with me, untouched by these developments.",1592478437.0,wqzu,relationships
"Follow up to ""I'm at my wit's end with my messy partner""","First, thank you for the support in the original post. There was a lot of hard truth, and I didn't realize how much I needed it until today. 

I 29F sat my 30M boyfriend Of 1.5 years down today to have one final talk about him being a lazy slob. Half eaten food and dirty dishes on his desk for days, empty soda cans everywhere, food wasted from being left out overnight. Today I found old chocolate milk spilled down the wall behind his desk and on his footrest. Tried to work with him, he just won't keep up with himself, it's been a year of this. Talked to him today, laid it out, had a very civil talk with him. And then he hit me with ""I guess now is a good time to tell you that I don't love you anymore"". I asked him how long he felt like this, he said he's known for about a month. Guess what happened a month ago? We signed another year lease. Yep, this asshole knew he didn't want to stay with me, and still signed a year lease with me. Needless to say our relationship ended today, with 11 months left on our one bedroom apartment lease. Almost 15 years of friendship. 

I called my mom and sobbed of course, talked for a bit. Now I'm back home. I told him he could have the living area, I would move my stuff into the bedroom, and his stuff into the living area. I bought the bed before we got together, keeping that. We don't have a couch. He works overnights and leaves for work in a few hours. I'm thinking of moving all his stuff, buying him an air mattress (more than he deserves, I know, but no couch) and buying a lock for the bedroom just to really solidify boundaries, it'll be done before he gets home. I'm not trying to be petty, I'm not gonna break his stuff or throw anything away. As I'm moving his stuff out of the bedroom I'm vacuuming and throwing away his trash. Cleaning up after him one final time. 

I feel oddly free. I am a little worried that it means everything will come crashing down on me later, but moving everything is really helping me work through this. I'm going to move all my cool decorations into the bedroom, going to hang that poster that I tried to get him to help me with for 6 months.

I was certainly blindsided today, I'm still not sure if I lucked out though. I have no friends, and my family lives states away. Nowhere to go regularly to steer clear of him. But the support I've gotten here makes me feel less alone, thank you. 

Heartbroken, but gonna be okay.

"I (26F) got invited to my friend’s (26M) wedding, but my fiancé (27M) is not","
My friend (26M) I met in college proposed to his girlfriend last year, and they are getting married next year! He shared the news with our friend group and we were so happy for him and couldn’t wait to celebrate.

I’ve (26F) been in a long term relationship with my partner (27M), and we got engaged a few months after my friend! Likewise I shared the good news with our friend group and they were happy for us.

My friend asked for my mailing address to send a wedding invite, and yesterday I received the invitation! However it’s only addressed to me, and the invitation explicitly says “one seat saved in my honour”. 

Maybe I should not have assumed but I thought my fiancée would have been invited too. It feels a little strange and awkward to think about attending a wedding alone without my life partner with me. Am I overthinking this? Maybe it’s because my friend doesn’t know my fiancée very well? I want to ask why but I also don’t want to make my friend uncomfortable or pressure to extend the invite to my fiancée, I understand how expensive and complicated weddings are… any thoughts on approaching this, or if I should at all?

For context, we live in Canada if that matters at all. Thanks for reading

When should I [23M] tell the girl I'm dating [22F] that I don't have a penis?,"When I was in my early teens, I lost most of my penis in an accident. There's nothing there now. I have testicles but basically there's no penis attached to the top of it anymore. I know this sucks, but I've come to peace with my condition. People have all sort of disabilities, this is mine and it's not the worst thing in the world.

My problem is dating. All girls that I've dated so far, without exception, have walked away once they know of my condition. I don't blame them, but I'm thinking that maybe I'm not handling the situation properly. I've always told the truth fairly early on, thinking that I should let them know early on so that they can decide if they want to keep on dating as it's not fair to waste their time if this indeed is a deal breaker to them, but this has never worked well for me.

Now I'm dating a girl that I really like for around a month, and I still haven't told her. Should I tell her now? Should I wait a little longer? How should I tell her? Just an honest conversation and telling them directly, which is what I've been doing so far?

I'm a little disappointed with my past experiences. I know and have accepted what this situation means for me in terms of sexual life, but I'm coming to the understanding that this might even mean I can't even have relationships, which isn't what I was expecting. 

**tl;dr**: I'm confused about how to communicate to potential partners about the fact that I don't have a penis. ",1458045625.0,Marboxbl,relationships
[Update] I [29F] am unsure on how to put the moves on my husband [32M],"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nakwe1/i_29f_am_unsure_on_how_to_put_the_moves_on_my/)

Tl;dr of last post: Due to coming off some long term medication, I have a sex drive for the first time in about 10 years. Realized I have no idea how to hit on my husband or initiate in general.

My last post didn't get a ton of attention, but I thought I would update people anyways. I took most everyone's advice and talked to my husband. He thought the whole situation was hilarious (in a nice way). But he was very reassuring. I told him about my fears of rejection, or doing something wrong. How my body issues have made it difficult to initiate because I fear I wont be able to turn him on. He gave me some ideas on how I might come on to him, what subtle moves might work to help initiate. He also reassured me that unless something major was going or he was sick, he would pretty much always reciprocate. He soothed my body fears and told me he finds me very attractive and I shouldn't worry about that. 

You guys, this has been life changing. Talking with my husband completely alleviated my fears. After a couple of false starts, I was able to start initiating. And its been going great. We're both all over each other all the time, just like we were highschoolers again. Maybe even better. Thank you so much everyone for convincing me to just talk to my husband.

"[UPDATE] My [22F] former roommate [30M] is freaking me out, what should I do?","Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8efmq2/my_22f_former_roommate_30m_is_freaking_me_out/

No one asked for an update, but I thought I'd provide a short one.

**TL;DR: I never have to see John again in my entire life. David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.**

Shortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates.

It's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate.

A few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago.

We broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not ""rock the boat"". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again.

Anyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction.

**EDIT:** I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. ""David"", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. ""John"" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything.

Found out husband has slept with my friend before we started dating ,"Hello. I am so heartbroken and I need different opinions on my “problem”. So I (31F) have (had) a very very good friend (34F) for 10 years. I would say best friend. I always told her everything. Every detail about my relationships and sex life. And she to me too (or I was only thinking that). My rule my whole life was to never be with my friends ex. Never. I dont like that. I dont like sharing same person with my friends (That’s only my opinion and my preferences if anyone is offended) 

So I started dating my husband (37M) and my friend was so excited. I knew they were friends before. I told her everything, every detail of our sexual life and she was so excited for me and encouraged me. 

So fast forward 5+ years my husband and I have a long rough period. And in one fight he told me my friend has gave him a blowjob. I was shocked. And I have called my friend and asked her is that the truth. She told why would he say that? And we finished conversation. 

Today he started a fight and I asked him, has he slept with her? And told me yes. A couple of times. I asked her she confirmed. She told me that was one-two months before we started dating and that she didn’t want to tell me. They had talked then and Said that they wont tell me that. she confirmed me that he wanted to tell me that at start our relationship. And that he didn’t want problems one day when we have kids. And she begged him not to tell because that would ruin our friendship.

Im so heartbroken and I dont know how to feel. She knew every detail of our sex life for past 5 Years, she knew about every fight. About everything. And she stayed quiet. So was he. Im so disappointed, shocked. Betrayed. The thought she knew how my husband privates parts are and sexual preferences makes me sick ( I am aware that he had other girlfriends and I am alright with that, but I can’t feel the other way). Goes the same way for my husband and her private parts and other. So they are the same to blame.

The only thing I told her that if she only told me they have been together I wouldnt be with him. Ever. 

The reason he told me that is because he saw text messages between us where I spoke with her because of our problems, and he lost it and was so mad at her. So i should know who I tell my marriage problems to (funny, after 5 years)

I just feel like a fool. And I dont know how to navigate with both of them. Cut out or not. My feelings are so mixed.


Tl;dr: Husband and almost best friend slept before we started dating. They agreed not to tell me. After 5+ years my husband told me that in a fight. 

Update: thank you all for your comments. I have read them all and probably will read it two more times. I have posted this to see another opinions - good or bad. And other view of that because sometimes our feelings can overcome our mindset. And I am greatful for all the comments, really.

I know sometimes I have told too much. But that was not coming in a bad way. I was to naive and I trust people too much sometimes. I understand that can hurt people. And I understand his reaction but not in this way. 

For the situation, I dont know what to do yet. I dont mind he slept with someone else before me, I have had other partners too. Simply it hurts so much because I wouldnt have guess it, never. They had a choice to tell me, they didn’t. But I guess it was from a place that is good for both of them, not me. In that time she didn’t lose a good friend and he got a wife. That is selfish from both of them because they didn’t think how would I feel knowing all that.

From this I think I cannot be a good friend with her anymore because in every situation I have supported her and gave all my best. In fact she was the first person to know I am pregnant. For my husband, he lost my trust and I dont know how work this out.

Should I tell my fiance (both mid-30s) that I'm disappointed in my ring?,"TL;DR My anti-jewelry fiance gave me a ring that is almost the exact opposite of what I wanted and cost less than his new computer desk after talking about how he was saving for it for a long time.  How do I tell him I am disappointed in the ring and would like to change it?  Or am I just being snobby?

It's been a couple weeks now since my fiance proposed, which I am ecstatic about. It was a long time coming, we've been together 4 years. There's some background to the proposal I think is relevant. We've been talking about marriage since our first anniversary and I was getting upset after several years that it wasn't happening. First, and most relevant, he said that he was saving money for a ring and that was why he hadn't proposed yet. Later, he added in that he wanted me to quit smoking before he would propose, but that reason alternated with the money for a ring reason. I was really feeling like he was just making excuses and so was trying to come to terms with the possibility we would just never get married. At Christmas I lost it and broke down in tears because I felt like it would never happen, at which time he told me he had already bought a ring and it was on it's way. I was totally thrilled.

The ring came and he... handed me the package it was in. I opened the mailer myself and took the ring out and put it on. He said since I knew it was coming he would forgo the ""ceremony"" of it all. Not gonna lie, I'm disappointed about that. I don't need a huge display but I really would have liked him to say the words ""will you marry me"" and put the ring on my finger. But the past is past.

The thing is that I'm unhappy with the ring. I actually love it, and for any other occasion I would be thrilled with the ring. But it's just not... an engagement ring. We *had* talked about what kind of ring I would want, so it wasn't a mystery. I wanted a certain color of gold, and it's a different one. I wanted a certain stone, that's not it. I wanted a couple of different stone shapes, and it's the one that I specified I would never want. On top of all that, it is inexpensive. He spent more on his new computer desk than my ring. All those times he said he was saving for a ring are just... a lie. We both make very decent money and he had some debt to pay but is in a really good spot financially, just like I am. The ring isn't necessarily cheap looking but combine all the factors and I am just disappointed.

On top of that, he is extremely against buying jewelry and has said multiple times that the only jewelry I'll ever get is going to be my engagement ring. This is the one and only thing I'll ever have that I will wear on my person that says ""I love you"" from him, and it just feels like so little.

I waited until I'd calmed down a bit and spent some time reflecting and I'm now unsure about whether or not I should say anything. One thing that I think may make me feel a bit better is to upgrade the to the stone/cut that I want instead of getting a wedding band, but I feel like I can't suggest that without admitting that I am disappointed in the ring as is, and in a lot of ways I feel like a snob being unhappy with it. What should I do? Should I suggest upgrading the ring and hope he doesn't read too much into it or do I need to explain? Am I just being a big old snob that I don't have a traditional engagement ring and I need to get over it?",1613162472.0,myBisL2,relationships
UPDATE: My (28F) partner (33M) doesn't want to commit to showing up when he says he will.,"\[UPDATE 10/17\]

Y'ALL

I did not think that many people were going to follow up on this. I didn't include a lot of info bc I didn't want him finding this, but I doubt he reads here sooo:

1. The drinking—he doesn't drink everyday any more. In fact, he stopped drinking for two weeks straight and only had a couple of drinks when he was upset about something. I don't think he's drank since.
2. The weed—he hasn't stopped smoking, but he has stopped smoking during the day. He'll usually smoke at night before we go to bed and that's kinda it.
3. We had a conversation about him going to therapy—he's been in the past and had really bad experiences with it. He doesn't trust therapists, and as we all know with therapy, it only works if you want it it. I can't make him go if he doesn't want to. I don't necessarily like this outcome, but until it becomes hazardous to his health, I'm not going to push it.
4. He didn't trick me into believing that I was the problem. I talked to my therapist, and she pointed out my responses as being emotionally manipulative.
5. I've been single for most of my life; I don't have a problem being single. I don't need another person to validate me. I just happen to like this one.

Reddit, I'm fine. I've been in toxic relationships before that I should have bailed on way earlier. This isn't one of them. You know how I know? Because when we argue, he established the rule that we're on a team, and we're working out a solution together. We obviously don't always remember this, but we've stuck to it. There is no me against him or him against me, it's us against whatever is bringing us down. Also, he made the rule that we should hold hands when we argue or hug after taking a break. It's hard to be mad at someone you're in physical contact with.

Also, thanks to those of you who left well wishes. I don't think there's a right or wrong in this situation, but I think it's easier to pick at a stranger's flaws than it is to believe in their judgement.

tl;dr: get off my back reddit

Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cxlxvd/my_28f_partner_33m_doesnt_want_to_commit_to/).

tl;dr from last post: My partner won't commit to being on time, when confronted, said he'll now say ""maybe"" to showing up and never give a time.

SO, after reading this and realizing that my partner was having a problem with drugs/drinking and calling multiple friends, I sat down with him after having a blowout fight and had a real conversation about boundaries. I asked him why he didn't want to commit to showing up, and he said he didn't think it was a big deal because he'd been doing it all his life to everyone. Even his close friends, who have confronted him about as well. He was just raised like that where it was never guaranteed that someone would show up, which seems a bit…weird to me.

Some of the ""laziness"" around showing up had to do with his depression, which I totally get. There have been days where I couldn't even make it out of bed. It's not really a choice you have sometimes.

He realized that I was really upset about it (finally), and after I said that I need to feel like I can trust his word, he said he'd try. And it's been about a month, and it hasn't been exactly smooth, but he's stuck to his word—shown up when he said he would, communicated when/if he would be more than an hour late.

Another big thing is that I realized I was behaving in emotionally manipulative ways as well—guilting, shaming, stonewalling. It was in response to his flippancy, but it wasn't helpful for either of us. He's always been calm with me and very clear that he wants to work on our issues together. That's what counts to me.

tl;dr It's not perfect, but we're committed to making it work. We're both growing. (:",1570781116.0,normally__ish,relationships

I wasted another year of my life by trying to help a person that never helped themselves and I'm paying for it in every way imaginable. I introduced him to the r/stopfindom subreddit, we went to therapy three times (only initiated when I caught him), I tried avoiding it, I tried confronting him. Nothing worked because he never stopped""the cycle.""

I was going to study abroad in Asia in December and I did not need this on my mind before I went. So very impromptu on Nov. 16, I decided I could not be with him anymore.  I was sick of feeling used and lied to about something that he didn't need to lie about. I didn't have solid proof. I just had it mentally because I felt he was hiding something from me. And he wasn't trying to fix our relationship at all, even though he swears up and down he did.

Instead of handling it well, he shows me an engagement ring his mom gave to him as I was breaking up with him and begged me to stay again. We didn't speak at all while I was away and I wish it stayed that way. I came back early January and our lease isn't up until February so I decided we could live together until then. And it was great until Monday, or at least I thought so anyway. We were talking openly about our feelings and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong.  He still wanted to be my friend. (Hard no.)

It wasn't until this last Monday, that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one. While he was at work his old phone kept going off so I looked at it. I fully acknowledge that since we aren't together I had no right to go through his phone but the shit I found makes me feel no guilt what so ever. If anything, I'm proud I can see him for who he actually is.

I found out he went to see one of the doms he was cheating on me with in LA and never stopped talking to her, even before we broke up. And in $15K in debt from sending multiple doms money (SN: he always told me one of the traits he doesn't like about me is how badly I handle money. HAR HAR. Projecting much?)

After I saw this I puked, packed a bag and left. I texted him that I am leaving and unless it was about the apartment, I never wanted to hear from him again.  We've been avoiding each other since. I've been slowly moving my things out and putting it in storage and I just feel emotionally defeated.

I went through three months worth of messages and found a few interesting things other than the nudes, videos and pretty subpar sexting. He acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her. To which she replies, "" That's called deceit not cheating."" He's glad that it was her. Glad that he can finally make someone happy. Glad he can please his goddess. Glad to be ""free"". Upset that I never understood him.

wow. what a goof lol.

He is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely believes she cares about him and that he's in the right. He thinks she's actually his friend, while she goes out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support (something he complained about to her about me. And how he loved emotionally fucking with me.)

She is being paid thousands of dollars to stroke their ego though, so I think I would understand that you have to keep the customer happy. She got $500 off of that LA visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me.

I feel like I should say that I respect sex workers and everything they do A LOT. But this specific dom is manipulative and has no boundaries. She is a half baked amateur at best who really has no clue on how to even pretend to know what she's doing. She gives actual doms a bad name.

Anyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their subs well being would never do the shit that these two concocted. Like sending me a picture of her ass and saying she only did it because he asked her to. Asking him how he's going to spoil me today and him telling her that he's going to take me to get my nails done as a surprise. Him telling her how unappreciative I am of his gifts because they don't feel genuine (which they weren't lol.)

I never consented to any of this and this shit has fucked me up for life. But get this, she's an advocate for mental wellness. What a joke.

She praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and was glad he could be ""free"" from all of my nagging and that I wouldn't hold this over his head anymore. (again, either she's really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person. More than likely both.) But he never told her that I was the one who actually ended the relationship.

But yeah, he never changed. He talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he's willing to risk everything for it.

I should have listened to everyone's advice and left when I had the chance. I shouldn't have moved in with him. Instead, I was emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that ""he did everything he could."" A direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six months.

To those that are questioning and still have hope for the hopeless, get out while you can. You can’t change anyone that does not want to change themselves. You can’t convince someone they’re in the wrong once they see that they’re in the right. You may think that other people may not know them as well as you do. It’s just something you tell yourself to avoid the actual truth that you’re sacrificing yourself for someone who won’t even do the same for you. Take care of yourself first because you’re only damaging yourself in the long run.

Sorry if this looks all over the place btw. As happy as I am that I made the decision to leave, I am super depressed and feel like I failed. I know this is all his fault, but I feel like I should have seen this coming. That besides this one thing, he was amazing. But it was a lie. Reddit really helped me the last time and that’s the only reason I’m posting here.  Because I haven’t slept in the past three days and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol.

A couple of notes:

* For those that don't want to google, **findom is financial domination**. A more direct definition is ***financial domination*** *is also known as money slavery and is basically a fetish of people who want to be controlled by another person in exchange for money. They pay people for controlling them and the one in charge is known as a financial dominatrix. Usually, a male is the submissive who is referred to as a pay pig, a money slave, and even a human ATM because the findom can shell out as much money as they can from these subs.*
* I don't have a problem with findom. We actually tried it together. I was uncomfortable with it mainly because I linked it with his cheating and lying. I expressed that I wanted to be monogamous and he stated that he wanted ""help"" and felt ""sick"" and wanted to change. I said that if this is what he wants to do that's fine, I'm fine with that but I don't want to be deceived and used. Just communicate with me. But as I found out from the messages, he loved emotionally manipulating me and loved to see me hurt. He got off on my pain, a direct quote. He got off on mentally abusing me, and that's not ok.
* He also had a homewrecking fetish but I guess it loses the appeal if I consent to it I guess.
* mini-rant: **DON'T DO THIS TO PARTNERS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR KINK OR YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY ARE OK WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMMUNICATE! GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO DECIDE ON WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE OK WITH. DON'T HURT SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY EXPRESS DISINTEREST AND GIVE YOU AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, BUT YOU ARE SO SELFISH THAT YOU RATHER LIE TO THEM AND PUT ON A FACADE OF ""WANTING HELP"".**
* you can probably find his post on r/stopfindom. I won't link it here but if you're curious it may be still there from like a year ago.",1579503160.0,hurtbuthopeful_12345,relationships
[UPDATE] How can I [19f] talk to him [20m] about our sex life?," 

Although my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ddj8r/how_can_i_19f_talk_to_him_20f_about_our_sex_life/) didn't get much attention, it's been about a year and a half and I thought I'd give an update. 

We broke up. In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me.

So what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.

Now, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time.

Oh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;)

**TL;DR** he cheated and it sucked, but not really because he was an awful partner in hindsight. new man much better and my life is more fulfilled :)",1542371137.0,throwawaqy3376,relationships
[Update] My (26/M) girlfriend (24/F) openly does not agree with my mom’s (62/F) choices. Am I unreasonable to break up with her over this?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gqhpq/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_openly_does_not_agree_with/)

Thank you all for the comments. I was pretty surprised by the volume. I was trying to downplay my concerns about the incidents at my parents’.

I met up with Rachel at her place before maybe heading for dinner together. I let her know that I wanted to talk about what she said about my mom during vacation. 

(I’m just going to provide a dialogue about what was exchanged to make it easier for me and hopefully less confusing.)

Me:  I’m still trying to understand why you said what you said at dinner and why you are in such disagreement with my mom.

Rachel: It’s so weird how good looking your dad is still. He could have been a model when he was younger. Your mom is not anywhere in the same league as your dad. 

Me: I don’t understand what you’re talking about.

Rachel: I think it’s odd that they are together. It’s creepy.

Me: My parents love each other. I don’t get the problem you have. I think that you purposefully brought up having kids earlier than my mom to criticize her.

Rachel: Well I don’t like your mom. I don’t have to like her.

The rest of conversation was more pulling teeth.  I had already given thought about what happened last weekend and I guess I share a chapter or two from my parents’ book, I want to feel confident about my partner. Rachel gives me doubt, not comfort. 

A lot of comments mentioned that I may have been oblivious and what I initially perceived as frankness was likely always tactlessness, that I may have not noticed it was tactlessness because I was in agreement.  I think these were factors, but I also didn’t agree with Rachel always on her opinions, I just didn’t disagree either.

I broke up with Rachel last night. Her parting words were “A mama’s boy is just plain ugly. And you’re cursed with your mom’s looks!”

**Edit**: So I rang my parents to let them know that I broke up with Rachel. I spoke with my dad first and he said, “You made a good decision. She was dumber than a box of hair.” Then I spoke with my mom and she asked why I ended it. I told her that she was too irrational and contradictory. She wasn’t convinced that was the entire reason so I told her everything since she has a pretty thick skin. She had a real good laugh and said that Rachel’s just a mean girl and she’s glad that it didn’t take me longer than 8 months to work that one out. And she also told my dad that he's still got it. 

**TL;DR**: Broke up with Rachel. She was tactless to the end.

I love you too soon update,"Hi,

Original post was here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying\_i\_love\_you\_too\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying_i_love_you_too_soon/) 

Thought I'd drop a quick update as so many nice people gave advice.

I was definitely over thinking things and suspect I was just being over worried due to his widower status (I've never really consciously associated that to him before I started reading some of the replies to my original post)

Over the past few weeks I've stayed at his more often than not and things have been great.

He hasn't said ""I love you"" yet but here's a list of things he has said/done that helped me realise not saying it doesn't mean he's not feeling it....

In no particular order:

The little messages in the morning/evening on the rare occasions I didn't stay at his. Yup he's still thinking of me even when I'm not there.

He ordered some toiletries for me on his weekly shop so I had some at his place too (After checking with me what I'd need) Plus I'm getting invited to join his ""meal planning"" discussions where everyone one in the house gets to pick at least 1 meal for the coming week (This is making me feel like part of the family and not just a guest)

He's cleared out some drawer and wardrobe space in his bedroom so I can keep stuff at his too (this one was pretty huge to me)

When his daughter asked ""Is Miss teacher going to live with us forever? his reply was a cheeky little smile and a ""Not yet"" - yup irrational or not the ""yet"" sent a few flutters off :D

He's really open about everything. He's admitted to me that at one point in his life he really didn't believe that he'd be capable of love again (in a romantic way) but he knows now that's not true (Perhaps irrationally on my part - I really did read that as ""I love you"" Just in a, I really can't say it way) 

He's arranged for his parents to have the kids this weekend so we can have a night away and a date or two because and I quote ""You deserve to be treated like a princess too sometimes and I don't want you to feel I only want you around for the children""

He's posted a few pictures on social media of us (with and without the children) my favourite being a selfie of all four of us snuggled on the sofa with the caption ""Star Wars night with the family - life is good"" 

After the previously mentioned Star Wars night, whilst we were being intimate I let slip another ""I love you"" in the heat of the moment and he replied ""I know"" which if you're a bit of a Star Wars fan (which we both are) is kind of the cool guys way of saying it. A little bit nerdy I know! 

TLDR: An update on my last post. Partner still hasn't said ""I love you"" directly but I'm 99.9999999% sure that he does. And I've definitely not scared him off lol",1597675755.0,Dirtyteacher1992,relationships
UPDATE: How do I [23 F] back away from this guy [31 M] without losing my favorite coffee shop?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vjxrb/how_do_i_23_f_back_away_from_this_guy_31_m/) and original

TLDR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?

So I had been meaning to post an update about this for a while but never got around to it, and then last night something really big happened and I think its really important that you guys keep in mind that this is all happening in my second language, nobody involved in the story speaks English (Except Sarah a little bit).

So where we left off with my last post, I had had a conversation with Sarah about Derek that made me feel better. Derek later reached out to me, apologized, said he had drunk too much on an empty stomach and that he was embarrassed about his actions. 

I'm sorry you guys, but I agreed to hang out with him again, this time just over coffee. Things were fine and he further integrated me into the neighborhood by introducing me to the people he knows and inviting me to join other neighbors for drinks and such. He opened up to me about a traumatic event that happened to him in his past and about his mental illness. He brought me around his family and his nieces who were all lovely. Other people seemed to adore him. I really liked all of this and we quickly fell into a romantic relationship. 

Derek seemed to be almost flaunting the relationship around the neighborhood. I had one other conversation with Sarah where she asked me some questions about how I felt about him. I explained that I liked him but felt confused and that he was moving quickly. She told me, in English so I know she was serious, ""Take your time."" soon after this Derek broke things off with me very suddenly, and rather forcefully. I found his sudden change of heart very confusing and upsetting. A week after he broke up with me I asked him to come over to my apartment to talk about what happened and we agreed to remain friends, since we'd have to see each other around the neighborhood. 

I spoke about all this with Sarah, who told me that she didn't know anything about it and said that she was sorry. About a week after I agreed to remain friends with Derek he invited me out for a drink, gave me a necklace, and we got a little bit intimate, but he clearly told me ""Do not talk about me at the bar."" which I found very strange. 

This is getting longer than I wanted it to be so I'm going to jump to last night. Sarah and the other woman who owns the cafe are a couple, they've been together for 10 years and they invited me to spend Christmas eve with them since they knew I would be alone. I brought up Derek, of course, and asked them why they thought that he wouldn't want me to talk about him in the Cafe. Silvia played dumb until we had some privacy and then she revealed to me that she and Derek had had a relationship while he was seeing me.

At first, he had lied to her and said that we were strictly platonic, but that lie quickly fell apart. Sarah said that she wanted to talk to me about it but never had the opportunity because we were always in the cafe. She apologized that some days she had acted cold towards me (which I hadn't noticed) and she said that after a few weeks she had insisted that Derek choose either her or me. Apparently, he chose her. Soon after that, she ended things with him completely. The next evening he invited me out for a drink to try to rekindle things

So Sarah apologized to me. She said she felt stupid and like a bad person, but that she had been feeling old and unattractive lately (she is 50). I told her that I wasn't upset with her at all, just shocked and that I was sorry I had been so oblivious to the real situation. 

So, I definitely didn't see that coming. I'm not going to confront Derek about this, I'm just going to let it go and move on. Sorry for acting like an idiot. I wish I could say I've learned something but I probably haven't. 

Merry Christmas everybody.

TL;DR: Derek and Sarah were together the whole time and Derek was trying to play both of us. Merry Christmas.",1545739438.0,WrongCompetition,relationships
"After 12 years of marriage and two kids, my (37f) husband (37m) came out as gay and we are divorcing. I am sick to death of people telling me how ""courageous"" he is and me being expected to go along with it. Is it wrong for me to want to tell them the truth?","And edit 3 (I forgot to type this as I was just going to bed): The whole reason I came here was to know how to respond to our acquaintances when they approach me about it being so great Mark came out. This is basically going to be my go to response: ""I'm happy that Mark finally had the courage to live true to himself, but divorces are always sad and unfortunately ours is no different."" 

Edit 2: just realized I could edit after the lock. This is my first gold...thank you so much...this has been amazing at the all the support I've gotten. I don't even know how many private messages I've gotten since the lock and how many people have gone through this or had relatives to through this.


Things will be static for a while but when there is news I will post an update. Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world.

Thank you again.


I hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here. 

Mark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all. 

Marriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count. 

Then about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself. 

He moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this ""man"" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover. 

Mark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further. 

It happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for ""living true to himself"" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost ""shamed"" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor. 

Is it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was. 


   
**tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our ""community"" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision. 

Edit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that!

1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives. 

2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest. 

3. Lots of great tips and I really appreciate every comment...this was way bigger than I thought and I'm reading all of them. Thank you. ",1454595670.0,wifewithgayhusband,relationships
UPDATE: My Girlfriend wants to take a stressful job and I foolishly set an ultimatum against it," [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mrah04/my_girlfriend_wants_to_take_a_stressful_job_and_i/)

I (27M) would like to thank everyone who took time to give me valuable advice, it helped me realize I was going about it the wrong way and possibly ruined a relationship of 7 years . Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created.

I think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind.

I think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses.

She really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company.

I have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out.

Tl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money. We made a plan to fix it.",1618687162.0,Revolutionary_Exam45,relationships
I (27M) feel terrible & depressed because my girlfriend of 3.5 years (26F) can't perform sexually due to a health condition and doesn't value physical intimacy. What can I do?,"This is an odd one. I've been with her for 3.5 years, though most of it long distance, so our time together was limited to a couple months each year. Recently she finished school and moved across the country to be with me, before she did I expressed my concerns that I didn't want to be the reason she'd move and that I can't promise we'd end up together. She moved anyways, we've been living together for about 6 months. Things have been going alright, but lurking problems with our sex life have come to the fore.

She has a health condition which limits her ability to move her hips and limits sensation - that's as specific as I'll get. Otherwise she's very active and lives a normal life. I'm her first sexual partner, but she is not my first. Sexual contact and quality time are how I best ""hear"" the affection of a partner, I've always been a sexual person. She is not asexual, but due to her condition she simply doesn't enjoy sex and never has - best case she has minimal sensation and worst case she starts to hurt. She isn't vocal, can almost never finish (even on her own alone-time, due to a lack of sensation), and doesn't see sex (or being physically intimate) as a big part of a relationship - I always have. I always have to initiate, and while she will reciprocate it almost always feels somewhat forced on her part, like a chore, which leaves me feeling utterly terrible. I've communicated my concern about our sexual incompatibility, several times over the past 3.5 years, and she's always said she will try. My problem is that I'm not sure there's anything to ""try"". I don't want her to have to ""try"". I've tried to get her to open up, to relax and accept herself and be more sexually free, but when there isn't sensation it's just a nonstarter for her, which also means she almost never initiates anything and there's never any romantic interactions outside of the of when we're intimate - it's not how she thinks.

My mind has begun to wander. I remember previous sexual partners and I miss feeling physically wanted and satisfied, I miss having an actively participating partner. I miss the feeling of being able to satisfy my parter, and the intimacy that a good sex life brings into a relationship. I cheated on a partner of mine in the past, immediately came forward with it, and felt terrible - I swore on my life I'd never do that again to someone I love. I'm going to seek professional help but the waitlist for therapy at my University is at least a month, and frankly the therapist is terrible. I'm stuck in a shitty cycle of 1) feeling like I deserve a sexually compatible partner, 2) degrading myself for labeling my girlfriend (in my head) as sexually incompatible with me despite all her efforts and her condition, 3) reconciling with the fact that she has a medical condition and doesn't really have any control over the situation, and 4) trying to understand how to make things work or if that's even an option.

She is a possessive, so extra partners is not an option - and frankly not what I want. I want intimacy with my partner. Her mind has always been on marriage, but I don't see how any marriage can work without intimacy and satisfaction for both partners. What can I do when we've already talked this out and tried to address it for years long-distance, and now months of living together? Do I just squash the part of myself that wants to give and receive intimacy? Am I wrong for thinking that is a requirement of a healthy relationship? Are there other things we can do? I feel like she has no choice due to her condition. I refuse to cheat. The idea of leaving her for something that appears so shallow, when we have an otherwise good relationship, ruins me and will ruin her.

Thanks for the help...

TL;DR! Girlfriend has a health condition that makes it so she can't really move her hips and doesn't feel much sexually - and her personality understandably does not weigh prioritize physical intimacy. I am very physical and always have to initiate intimacy - 3.5 years on it feels like I am a sexual chore to her - though she will never admit to it. We've always talked openly about trying to fix this, but nothing has worked. I miss the feeling of intimacy that comes with a compatible sexual partner and it's making me doubt an otherwise solid relationship.   


Edit: Just nipping any comments now in the bud that suggest trying to spice things up in the bedroom. We've tried everything you can think of. The reality is that when your partner doesn't feel sexual pleasure that doesn't give you much to work off of.

Update: Me (F29) with my BF (M31) of 3.5 years won’t help me clean or do things he doesn’t care about," This is an update from my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/egckva/me\_f29\_with\_my\_bf\_m31\_of\_35\_years\_wont\_help\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/egckva/me_f29_with_my_bf_m31_of_35_years_wont_help_me/)

I ended things a little over a month ago, and things have simultaneously been terrible and amazing. I asked him if he would be willing to go to therapy with me, and he refused. He told me when we first starting dating that he would never go to therapy, and I assumed he'd change his mind at some point because he would care enough about me and our relationship to work through the hard things in counseling. We see this all the time on this sub, but really, when people tell you who they are, believe them.

Refusing to go to therapy really left me with the two choices of staying and having nothing change and being unhappy... or leaving. I opted to leave even though it was scary and so, so hard. The initial heartbreak is starting to fade, and I'm working on rediscovering myself. I know that I did the right thing for myself, but it was also the hard thing.

I kept this throwaway account around, and I'm posting this update because I wanted to thank this community and the individuals who offered their input. I know I didn't comment on anything in my original post, but it was very helpful to have some outside opinions. I appreciate you all so much. Thank you for your advice and assistance when I was faced with a difficult situation.

My partner did not attend our sons birthday,"Tl;dr: my (31f) partner (27m) didn’t go to our son’s birthday due to an apparent panic attack. How do I address this? I’m so mad. 


Throwaway just in case.. As the title says, my partner did not attend our son’s second birthdays yesterday and I’m honestly so mad and upset. We have been together about 4years. 


Our son turned two yesterday and for a few months I’ve been planning his birthday at my mums farm. I did have a feeling that he would pull this because he’s notorious for not attending anything, but I thought surely this would be an exception, apparently not. 


The morning went great and I thought everyone was good to go. We had done presents the night before as I knew party day would be a lot, so my partner woke up early with my son and my daughter (6months) and I slept in. My partner and son were playing all morning, everyone was happy, I had a shower and then my partner had a shower. 


It was 4 minutes until the planned time to leave and he was still sitting there and not getting dressed and I asked him “are you not going? Why aren’t you getting dressed? What’s going on?” And I honestly at this point didn’t expect him not to go. 


He told me he thought he was having a panic attack and he teared up. I might have been a bit of an a-hole here because I honestly didn’t really do anything. I knew exactly where this was going because this is his mo. 


I continued running around frantically getting things in the car getting ready to leave and he asked if he could help with anything. I asked again is he going and he said no. I told him to put stuff in the car. I was so incredibly angry and upset but was already 20 minutes behind. 


I text him as soon as I left and told him he still has an hour to change his mind and come, as I was going early to set up decorations. He said thanks and that was the last I heard from him before I got home around 7pm, we left at 9am. He didn’t come he didn’t ask how it went, he reacted to my Facebook post and that was it. 


When we got home, I text him when I was nearby asking him to get a bottle ready, which he didn’t, and I could see through the windows that he had hung streamers all over the house. I mean, he went to a lot of effort it seems to have hung these streamers and there were also a lot of balloons everywhere. I honestly feel like it would have been less effort for him to just attend the party. He hasn’t even apologised or anything. Clearly he knows he fucked up right? I’m guessing this is why he hung streamers everywhere. He also brought our son inside and had him at the computer as he was in a game instead of taking him straight to bed like normal when he’s asleep when we get home which annoyed me even more. 


I honestly don’t know what to do. I have hardly spoken to him since last night, I’m just so angry. I don’t even know if he realised how mad and disappointed I am and not to mention how embarrassing it was to repeatedly be asked where he is or if he’s working and people asking why he’s not at the party. I cried most of the way to my mums, we did have a good day and my son had an awesome time which is awesome. 


Anyway I’m sorry this has been so long but please give me advice, what do I do? How do I address it? Should I address it, or just let it go?",1716688361.0,RegularSwan5832,relationships
"Pastor's son [22M] broke into media department office and stole my [24F] camera and related equipment. I'm expected to replace it because he ""can't afford to buy a new camera and feed his two daughters""","I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom. 

Background: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood. 

The media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. 

A couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's ""just shooting a video, not that hard"". I declined, so he asked me if I could ""shoot a music video for him"" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. 

I hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded ""Alright"". 

The following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. 

At first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. 

During the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes ""the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model"". 

Okay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was ""left open"" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. 

So I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my ""mess"" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. 

Fast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has ""two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera"" and she ""doesn't know where it is or what he did with it"". 

At this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. 


**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.

Edit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:

Among other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  

Edit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. 

I've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. 

There's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one).

"I'm [34/m] struggling to be a good, supportive partner, but my s/o [36/f] tells me I'm mean and cruel.","I'm [34/m] struggling to be a good, supportive partner, but my s/o [36/f] tells me I'm mean and cruel.

I'm trying very hard to be a supportive and healthy partner to someone who is struggling, and it results in my own struggle.  We often have conversations that start out her asking me to hear her out and give her support on something that's troubling her or making her anxious, and I try really hard, but we often end up with her angry at me and calling me unemotional, mean, and cruel.  She is usually able to tell me what it was that I said that upset her, but I'm never able to anticipate what it might be, and it's always something I have said with the full intention of being in the moment and on her team.  I fear that I just don't understand or can't tell where her emotional pain-points are going to be moment-to-moment.  I want to believe her and accept her feelings as valid, but I just can't seem to keep her wants and needs straight enough to keep from blundering into a fight.

We're both in therapy for a variety of things, but it's hard and progress is slow.

I fear I will never understand, never make it as a good partner for her, and as long as we're together I'll be miserable just trying to keep up.  I don't know what kind of changes I need to make to be able to survive all this.

**tl;dr** I try to be a supportive partner, but no matter what I do she tells me I'm doing it wrong, and it sucks for both of us.  How can I change/do better?

edit: I appreciate the comments so far. I wish I could say that it's helping, but honestly I just feel more confused, and I don't know whether or not I should talk to her about this post.

Everyone dislikes my [30M] girlfriend [25F] because they think she's stupid,"Posting here because I'm conflicted, I usually think that if everyone dislikes your SO its for good reason. I've been dating my girlfriend for around nine months now and she met my family and friends. While people technically like her, they think that we shouldn't be together because they don't think she's smart enough for me and they see her as a trophy girlfriend. 


I'm divorced. My ex was a smart corporate type person. I usually try not to compare my new gf to her but she is completely different from my ex. She's a lot of fun, a lot more adventurous and really upbeat. She's great with my son. That said... She isn't that smart. She doesn't follow world news or politics and can't carry on a conversation about any of the topics. She is terrible at math. She's interested in simpler things. She dropped out of college to pursue a career in baking, and she has been really successful in doing so. She owns a bakery with her friend, her friend manages it and she deals with the day to day work. She's done very well for herself but she has a hard time relating to my family and friends. 


All of my friends and most of my family are pretty successful, most of them are highly educated and have interesting jobs. That's not to say that she isn't successful or that she doesn't have an interesting job, she's just completely different from the other people I'm around. There have been lots of comments like ""it's a good think she's hot,"" from them and I always shut them down but it makes me think they will never respect her. A few people have asked why I even like her, which is surprising because she is a very likeable person, but I think it's because they just can't relate to her at all. 


Does our relationship stand a chance? No one seems to think so and its starting to make me doubt it. I do love her a lot, for what it's worth. I have an insanely stressful job and I love that when I see her after, she never has anything to complain about and she is a genuinely good and happy person.

UPDATE - I think my SIL’s (23/F) best friend (23/F) is trying to get with my (25/F) husband (28/M) and she’s encouraging it. Am I delusional?,"My original post got locked because I didn’t use a ThrowRA account, so I made another account to post the update, so it doesn’t happen again (I'll post a link on my old account for proof that this is my new account).

**ORIGINAL** post for anyone hasn’t read it (the update is below) –

Link –  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ift0zm/i\_think\_my\_sils\_23f\_best\_friend\_23f\_is\_trying\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ift0zm/i_think_my_sils_23f_best_friend_23f_is_trying_to/)

My SIL (23/F) is my husband’s (28/M) half-sister, she was the product of their mother’s infidelity. His father divorced their mother when he was 12 after he found out through a paternity test she wasn’t his. My FIL refused to have anything to do with my SIL but continued to have a relationship with my husband, because of this my SIL is very clingy to my husband. My husband is also very protective of his sister and generally doesn’t tolerate anything negative being said about her, which is why I’m posting this here before mentioning anything to him.

My husband and I bought a house last year which has its own indoor swimming pool. My SIL was super excited when she saw it and asked if she could use it sometimes with her friend. We said it was fine, as long as she gave us a notice before she turned up. Her and her friend (Chloe) have used it many times before but almost never when my husband is home (he is a lawyer and works long hours). With lockdown, my husband has started to work from home. My SIL asked me if she and Chloe could come over and use the pool, I told her I was uncomfortable with them coming over as I’m pregnant and don’t want to accidentally expose the baby to anything risky. My SIL then asked if she and Chloe quarantined for two weeks would they be able to come over, my husband said it was fine.

Two weeks later they turn up to my house. My husband was in his office, so they go straight to the pool after making small talk. My husband ends up coming out after an hour and we’re hanging out in the kitchen. My SIL walks in to get a drink and she starts talking to my husband. Before she goes back to the pool, she says “Chloe’s going to be so happy to see you”. It was weird because my husband and Chloe aren’t close. Chloe comes into the kitchen two minutes later and spends the rest of her time talking to my husband until he excuses himself to get back to work. She’s super giggly and smiley when she talks to him. He would say something sarcastic and she would laugh like it was the funniest joke she’s ever heard. It honestly felt like she was flirting with him. Before she went back to the pool, she gave me this weird smirk-y look. Before they leave, they ask my husband if he’s working from home everyday of the week, he confirms he is.

The next two weeks, they come over to the house to ‘swim’ every single day. Except, Chloe never gets in the water. Instead she hangs around the house in her bikini (she was previously wearing a one-piece if it makes a difference) every single day. Whenever my husband comes out to hang around me, she quickly interrupts him and keeps him talking until he has to go back to work. I made lunch for us all and when I excused myself to call my husband down, my SIL quickly stopped me and said Chloe could call him for me. They shared a look and Chloe looked really happy when she went to get him. Chloe has also started to get touchier with my husband. She’s put her hands on his chest and arms, stands or sits really close to him. To my husband’s credit he does usually create space between them whenever she does something like this.

The reason I believe my SIL is in on this is because she’s made a few pregnancy-related jabs at me recently. She told me a story about how one of her friend’s boyfriends was cheating on her and then said something along the lines of “did you know a lot of men start cheating when their wives are pregnant?”. She’s also made comments about how I look chubby now and it looks weird next to my husband because he’s ‘well-built’. If she spots my husband out of the office she quickly goes to inform Chloe.

I know pregnancy hormones can mess with a person’s brain so I’m wondering if I’m just looking for something that isn’t there. My SIL sent me a text yesterday asking if they could come over to swim next week and I really want to say no but I know she’ll whine to my husband if I do. I ideally want to have a conversation with him before then but I’m not sure if I should mention the flirting.

Am I being delusional?

TL;DR – SIL’s and her friend are constantly asking to come over to use our pool but her friend never swims. Instead, she waits around to start talking with my husband. She seems very flirtatious whenever she talks to him but I’m not sure if it’s just pregnancy hormones getting to me.

**UPDATE –**

Well, I read and reread all of the comments on the original post to try and figure out how I was going to bring up the issue. Turns out, I didn’t have to. We were watching a movie and my phone lit up with another text from my SIL telling me she was now going to be here at 1pm the next day to swim with Chloe. My husband saw it and told me to tell her not to come. This is really weird behaviour for my husband because he tends to do anything to accommodate my SIL and very rarely refuses her anything. I asked him if something had happened and he shrugged it off and we kept watching the movie.

A few minutes later he paused the movie and said he wanted to ask me a question. He asked if I’d noticed Chloe never swam when she came to our house. I wish I could say I was calm and collected like the comments were advising but… I ended up laughing hysterically. I was honestly just so relieved he’d brought it up instead of me having to be the one to do it. I think my husband thought I was losing my mind.

When I finally stopped laughing, he repeated the question and said he wanted a serious answer. I said, “of course I’ve noticed” and he awkwardly replied “so… you must’ve noticed the other thing too”. To summarise the conversation that followed: My husband hadn’t noticed Chloe was flirting with him the first few days because he was so busy with work, he wasn’t really paying attention to anything else. He said when she started getting handsy is when he suddenly had the ‘light bulb’ moment that she was into him. He says he didn’t want to unnecessarily stress me out, so he never mentioned anything, but he was worried I’d noticed too and thought he was interested because he hadn’t immediately shut it down. He realised we would eventually have to have this talk, but he wasn’t sure how to bring it up (oh the irony). He did privately speak to Chloe and told her he was happily married and wasn’t interested in starting anything with anyone else. Apparently, she never took him seriously because she kept doing it.

In the end, he called his sister on Sunday to tell her either she got her to stop or Chloe couldn’t come over anymore. His sister ended up having a tantrum and said a few nasty things about me/the baby/our relationship. She insisted I was somehow behind his request and made some comments about how I was controlling and insecure because I looked like a ‘beach whale’ and Chloe was younger and hotter. He was pretty pissed at this and said if she said something like that about me again, he would stop speaking to her. She claimed I had baby trapped him and when my husband pointed out we were already married so I didn’t need to ‘trap’ him and that he was the one who wanted to start a family she kept insisting I had manipulated him into feeling that way. She claimed he was unhappy in our relationship and he always looked ‘tired’ because I was forcing him to slave away to fund my fancy lifestyle, whilst I sat on my ass all day. He pointed out he chose to be a lawyer knowing he would have to work long hours and I had only recently left my job, so her accusations were baseless.

She said some other stuff along the same lines but the thing that made my husband finally snap was when she said ‘it’ (the baby) was already ruining everything and it was just going to get worse when it was born and he should’ve dragged me to the abortion clinic whilst he had the chance. He told her neither her nor Chloe were welcome in our home anymore until they apologised for how they’d been behaving and for the things my SIL said. He said he wasn’t sure he could ever forgive or forget what she’d said about our child even if she did apologise and he couldn’t believe she would even think something like that, let alone say it. Apparently, she started crying and said she was sorry, that she didn’t mean it and she was just scared to lose him and that she wasn’t thinking clearly. He hung up on her. He showed me his phone and she’s been calling him and texting him since begging him to reply.

He asked if she’d said anything to me. I was debating whether to say anything or not, but he kept insisting he knew she had said something, and he wanted to know what it was. I told him the things I mentioned in the original post and a few other things she had said. He asked me why I never mentioned anything when she first said it and I mentioned how he got really defensive whenever I said anything even slightly negative about his sister and he… got defensive. I pointed out he was doing it again and after some back and forth he admitted that “maybe he was a little bit defensive when it came to her” but he promised to stop and he wanted to make sure we could talk about anything, including his sister.

He ended up mentioning wanting to try couples counselling. He said it wasn’t because he thought there was something wrong with our relationship but apparently he has been speaking to his dad a lot recently and he mentioned one thing he regretted about his marriage with MIL is that they never went to therapy until the cracks in their relationship were too big. In his current marriage they go, and it’s helped him avoid the mistakes of his first marriage. I agreed, so we’re probably going to try that soon.

My husband thinks my SIL will eventually turn up even if we tell her not to, but he promised he’d deal with her if she does.

So, reddit I guess you were right. I really did just need to speak to him. Thanks for the advice and comments, I enjoyed reading them all.

My wife (29F) is encouraging me (31M) to have an affair?,"Wife and I have been married for 5 years. I think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. I think she thought the same. However, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while I was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

Apparently ""Fernando and Sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! When he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what I'm getting from it.

So I told her flatly that I don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. Case closed I thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

I'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear I'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! She keeps going on and on about her work friend Fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

SO at this point I'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? She's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but I'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" It's concerning.

Straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""Fernando's Sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... I'm like... lost for words right now. How do I make it clear I don't want to ahve sex with someone else and I believe in monogamous relationships.

My wife (34F) gets very upset with me when I (35M) respond to her complaints with encouragement,"This morning is a perfect example. We were having a perfectly pleasant time coloring with our daughter and talking, and my wife said she didn't know why she felt so tired today. She often complains when she didn't get a perfect night's sleep, which is obviously super hard to come by with young kids, and she likes to review every time she woke up due to a noise or something I did in my sleep (like create too much body heat), but last night she had really an idyllic night of sleep. So I heard her out, and when she was done explaining the things she thought may be making her tired today, I got up to start getting my daughter ready to drop her off at daycare and I said ""I'm sorry you are still feeling tired babe, but fortunately we don't have TOO much going on today and I think with a hot coffee and a slow start to the day you should be able to get through it just fine. Eveb though you're feeling tired, luckily you do have a solid 8 hours in the tank, you got this!""



She stood up and, not screaming but in her equivalent which is a vicious tone, said ""You need to learn to just listen and and hear what I am saying! You are the worst at just listening to me."" I feel completely awful, I'm really struggling with my mental health right now and I had a markedly rough day yesterday in terms of my depression, so to not spiral downward again I asked what I should do better because I was genuinely trying to keep positivity in the house, and she told me to just sit there and tell her ""I'm sorry you feel like that.""


I feel like there is no place for my perspective or feelings when she wants to talk to me, and she complains all the time about me not connecting with her emotionally. I literally was doing that today by talking to her like I talk to myself when I need to get through a tired morning in a positive way, and she responded like I told her she doesn't matter or something. I don't want to share my feelings when the positive ones get shot down so visciously.

He’d tell her lies about me and my mom so she wouldn’t want to live with my mom (he told my sister me and my mom were going to throw away all of her toys, he got her a dog and told her if she stayed over my mom’s house nobody would feed the dog and it would starve) so because of this my sister has wanted to live with my dad since they divorced, and her relationship with me and my mom is pretty strained. 

When I was 16 I started dating a guy who was 24. I was with him for three years, I finally left him after he put me in the emergency room for the third time. I just left with my car and the clothes I had on in the ER, I left everything else and drove back to my moms house. 


Now my sister announced on social media she’s engaged to him. My mom called my sister furious. She said she’s been dating him for over a year now and my father new about the relationship and encouraged it. She told my mom she was 18 now, (she just turned 18 two weeks ago) it was too late and she couldn’t do anything about it. 

My mother talked to my father who basically said for me and my mom to eff off, that he doesn’t blame Alexander for putting me in the hospital and “hopes he does it again if I don’t shut up”. My dad admitted to purposely not telling my mom about my sister dating him, to keeping in contact with him and letting him stay over the house with my sister alone for years, he’s allowing all of this just to spite me and my mom. 


Is there any talking sense into either of them?",1644964768.0,throwRAkidis,relationship_advice
My (42 F) husband (44 M) has been dating and having sex with a woman because I have Multiple Sclerosis and we can no longer be intimate. He just found out she's pregnant. He hasn't decided what to do about the situation yet. Should I encourage him to stay with me or get a divorce?,"A few weeks ago he came to me and told me he can't live with a sexless marriage. I understood since I slso miss being intimate that way. He also said he would be discreet which wouldn't be hard since we no longer share a bedroom or bed. 

I think he's actually been seeing this woman a couple months longer than when he came to talk to me. He had been going out with friends (or so he said)  try often. 

He told me yesterday she is pregnant with his child and that he doesn't know what to do. He wants to be a dad but would need to leave and divorce me to do that. I guess she gave him an ultimatum and he has to make a choice.

This is really hurting me because I wish we had kids. I always wanted a baby but it never happened then I got sick.  

Should I encourage him to leave so that baby has a dad? It's probably the right thing to do even if it's not what I want. 

I love my husband so much but I know the toll the lack of physical intimacy has taken on our marriage.

Update: Devastated and Spiraling. I (M35) found a condom wrapper in my wife’s (34F) car. Now what?,"Lots of folks asked for an update. Not a whole lot to say but things are getting interesting. I am shaking as I type this. 

Thanks to everyone in the comments and the DMs for the empathy and well wishes. A lot of good tips and advice too. Man I would hate to piss some of you off. Some of you are vindictive. 

First off, I found a WRAPPER, not an actual used condom, so the suggestion of DNA testing was not useful. 

And thanks to u/uhidunno27 for the information about getting detailed phone records from Visible. Today at work during some break time I requested a download of  the phone records but it says the request could take up to 45 days. I can’t wait that long. 

I also drove by her work on my lunch break. I don’t know why or what I expected but her car was there as it normally is. 

Lots of good advice to track her, get a VAR, look at her phone without her knowing, hire an investigator, a lawyer, etc. 

I can’t deal with this. I am taking the advice a lot of you had and I’m just going to confront her today when she gets home. As some of you suggested, I plan to just put the condom wrapper on the table in plain sight and watch her body language. 

I am so scared and nervous I am almost pissing my pants. I am really starting to expect the worst. For me, if she cheated there is zero chance we will stay married. Zero. I don’t care what excuses or reasons or whatever she has, I am 100% done. No therapy, no counseling, nothing. 

I can’t believe I am typing this. It makes it seem real. I can’t imagine her sucking and fucking some other guy (or guys). That’s an image I could never get out of my head for the rest of my life. 

As far as assets, we don’t have a lot. We have a pretty nice house that her dad helped us pay for. I’m happy to let her have it with my fair share and paying back her father. Otherwise is bullshit like 2 cars, some furniture and some decent savings that we have both contributed to so I’m willing to split 50/50. 

The thought of divorce is burning a pit in my gut. I’ll post again after I confront her. Either way I think this thing comes to a conclusion tonight. 

Mini Update: Ok. Instead of sitting here pissing my pants, I wanted to just type few more things to keep busy. I’m sitting here trying to find any other reason to doubt her. 

The wrapper - it was fairly pristine. Not something stuck on a shoe or sitting in a parking lot. 

Dashcam - yes I’ve checked the dashcam footage. Nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary. Commutes to work, the gym and home. Maybe a stop or two for typical errands. Grocery store, cleaners. Zero suspicious activity. But she knows there is a dashcam too, so who knows. Maybe she’s just being really careful. 

The car - yes we bought it used 2 years ago. It is an 2018 Infiniti Q60 coupe. It had an extremely small back seat  I can’t imagine sex back there but who knows what motivated people might be capable of. I clean and vacuum it at least once a month so there is zero chance it has been there the whole time. Ironically we usually wash the cars together but this time I happened to be doing it alone. Had she been there this whole thing would probably be over now. 

Our current state of relationship - it’s really strong as far as I know. She comes home, we share a glass of wine while we make dinner together, talk about our day, cuddle on the couch if we watch a show, we really have what anyone from the outside would be jealous. No feelings of distance, no hiding of phone, and no drop off in sex which has always been and still is great. 

Her gym time - with as much as she does, it is really reasonable for her to spend 2 1/2 hours at the gym. I’ve gone with her. I’ve seen her work out. It’s pretty extensive and her body shows it. I am so proud of how great she looks and how she takes such good care of herself and encourages me and cares about our health. I’ve never been suspicious about it, maybe foolishly. 

Yes, she comes home and showers right away but she’s typically sweaty and feels gross. She doesn’t avoid me when she walks in. She will typically come over and greet me with a kiss on the lips and then hit the shower. If she was just having sex with a side piece I think she would be more discreet. 

We spend almost all of our time together on the weekends. Go for a jog, date nights, happy hour with friends, dinners with family, etc. She has a lot of girlfriends from work and they sometimes go out for a girls night like once every 2 months. But again nothing suspicious. I see the credit card charges so I dont believe she is hiding anything. And her girlfriends are all awesome and I love hanging out with them and their husbands / BFs. 

I’m torn and getting nervous about talking to her tonight but I gotta get this over with.

How do I (49f) move forward after my daughter (22F) hid her father’s affair from me for two years?,"I (49F) was married to my ex-husband, Derek (49M), for 20 years before divorcing a few months ago. We have two kids, a daughter (22F) and a son (17M). I found out Derek was having a two-year affair, and my world was shattered. But what hurt almost as much was discovering that my daughter had known about it the whole time. She actively hid it from me for *two years*—lied, covered for him, and never once tried to warn me.

When I found out, I was devastated, not just by my husband’s betrayal, but by my daughter’s choice to keep it from me. She was young at the time, and I understand it was a difficult position for her, but the pain was immense. I never confronted her directly, thinking it might affect her as she was about to go off to college. I just told her I knew, that I understood, and tried to move on. But after she left, I found myself distancing myself from her more and more. It wasn’t planned; I just needed space to heal, and that meant not calling her as often or reaching out as much.

Fast-forward a year and a half, and I’ve started dating someone (41M) who has a 10-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Recently, we all went to Disney together, and he posted a family photo of us on social media. For Context, my boyfriend covered all the expenses as a gift for his daughter's birthday, wanting to make it special for her. Along with my son and me, she chose her two cousins to come along, making it a big family-style trip that was all about her.  My daughter must have seen it because she didn’t call me for over a month afterward, and honestly, I wasn’t as affected by her absence as I would’ve been before. I still love her, but every interaction brings up that pain.

Out of nowhere, she called me in tears. She was screaming, saying I obviously hadn’t forgiven her and that I’d shut her out on purpose. She accused me of “replacing her” with my boyfriend and his daughter. She kept saying, “It was a long time ago, I was a kid, I didn’t mean to hurt you!” She said she thought she was doing the right thing by staying quiet, that she didn’t know how to tell me, and that she was terrified of breaking our family apart. She asked me if I’d ever forgive her or if I’d “moved on” for good. I tried to tell her that I loved her and never wanted to replace her, but she just kept pushing that I should “get over it by now” and that I’d abandoned her for this new life.

To top it off, my ex-husband later called me, furious, accusing me of “leaving” my daughter for a “younger man and a new family.” He even had the nerve to call me selfish for “moving on.” (Ironically, his girlfriend is 30, and he’s the one who blew up our family with his affair.) It’s like no one understands that I’m still trying to recover from years of betrayal, and it feels like I’m expected to just let it go, as if my pain doesn’t matter.

My son, who lives with me, found out about his sister hiding the affair after overhearing my husband's mom and sister talking. He was crushed and hasn’t forgiven her either, and they’ve barely spoken since. I never wanted him to know, but it feels like the entire family is divided now, and I don’t know how to fix it.

I’m in therapy, but I still feel lost. Part of me knows she was young and didn’t know how to handle it, but another part of me feels like she chose him over me. I love my daughter, but every time we talk, that hurt resurfaces. I don’t know if I’m failing as a mother or if I’m protecting myself. I feel like I’ve emotionally checked out, and I don’t know how to reconnect.

Edit: Just to clarify, my divorce actually happened a few months ago, not three years ago as I originally mentioned. My sister, who is a bit of a scatterbrain, encouraged me to post here and typed out much of it for me. In the process, she got the timeline wrong, and I didn’t catch it before posting. My daughter was 17 when she found out about the affair. She had a lot going on at the time, including having to change schools due to some personal issues and repeating a year. So, when I found out, it was less than two years ago. I hope this clears up the confusion. ",1731304761.0,ThrowRAlizinabliz,relationship_advice
I (34F) snooped through my boyfriend's (36M) phone- Got exactly what I deserve,"My (34F) boyfriend (36M) have been together for 9 months. Prior to us getting together he was married for a few years, but he found out she had been having an affair with someone out of state. We started dating through the separation and after the divorce had been finalized. Both of us had some trauma we were dealing with, but I thought we could work through it together. More recently, I'd become concerned that our relationship had become stagnant. I had fallen in love with him months ago, but was too scared to say it. But there was no signs of moving forward in the relationship or growing outside of our normal routine. We'd met eachother's friends and families and he had been with me through some pretty tough personal situations. To everyone looking in we seemed completely in love, but at the rate we were going I was afraid I'd never hear it. I couldn't understand what was stopping us from moving forward.

This past weekend, we were staying at a friends lake house for a wedding. At one point he went jet skiing with a friend, and I stayed behind to start getting ready for said wedding. His phone had been blowing up, and unfortunately my trauma got the best of me, and I snooped. I found exactly what I deserved to find; he was texting his ex wife.

This wasn't just casual conversation. He was sending her things like 'I'm thinking about you' and every time she told him she missed him he replied with 'I miss you too'. I am heartbroken. These were things he said to me. When I confronted him, he apologized. After of course trying to deny everything. I decided to make the hour drive back home and skip the wedding. I was upset and I didn't want to ruin the mood.

Today when I asked him why, he didn't really give me an answer other than he knew what he said to her was wrong. He did however tell me that I crossed a line by going through his phone and he wants to take a break from us for a while. I don't know what to feel. I'm sad that this might be the end, but I'm mad that this has all somehow been turned into all my fault. Don't get me wrong, I shouldn't have gone through his phone. I definitely made a mistake. But now instead of being in the dark about those two making me look like a fool, I know about it.

What should I do? Is this end or is there a way to salvage this? Please help me. Its been a long time since I've been happy, and I feel like I ruined it again.

TLDR: Went through my boyfriends phone. Found out he was texting his ex wife, and now he wants to take a break 'for a while' because he feels I crossed a line.

\*UPDATE\*

Dear subreddit /relationship\_advice,

I want to thank you all for your kind words, your cruel words, the encouraging words, and some of the totally unrelated and weird words.

I know none of you know me, but personally I've always considered myself somewhat of a disappointment. And I'm so sorry to let you know that I've gone and disappointed the majority of you that wanted me to be strong. I tried this morning. To no one's surprise he's definitely done with me, and I am still heartbroken.

You're probably all wondering why or how I could still want this to work. Simply put, it has been my experience that when you've be so alone for so long you will try to hang on to anything that has given you even a glimpse of hope and happiness, because going back to the alternative is so miserable.

I'm sorry to disappoint and let you guys down.

I just wanted to be happy.

"During our vacation in Vegas, I (28F) woke up at 2AM to find my husband (34M) missing, his location off, and thousands in charges from a strip club on our bank account. Where to go from here?","My husband and I booked a last-minute getaway to Vegas for a couple nights, we arrived yesterday.

We had tickets to see a show last night, but after a long day of drinking in the heat, I wasn't feeling well and needed to end the night early. I encouraged my husband to still go so he could enjoy his evening, so he did and I went to sleep.

2AM rolls around and I wake up to find that he never came back to the room - the show is literally at our hotel so I start to panic. I go to check his location, it's off. Then I text him asking where he was, he reads it and doesn't respond. I call him several times and he sends me to voicemail. While I was trying to get ahold of him, I see there were 2 separate charges for $1,000+ from a strip club. He didn't respond to me till nearly 3AM and just texted he was on his way back.

30 minutes later, he stumbles in the room absolutely obliterated. He tries to lie and say he was just gambling down the strip, that he never went to the strip club even though the charges were literally made with ApplePay and he hadn't lost his phone.

After going through his receipts, I found he'd been at the strip club for nearly 5 hours, essen confirming that he went straight from the show and left 40 minutes after my first ""where are you?"" text.

I also checked all of our accounts, and if all the charges made settle as they are, he'll have spent nearly $6,000 there. He swears he ""didn't cheat"" on me and says nothing sexual happened, though I can only imagine the situations you find yourself in after 5 hours in a strip club, especially when you're intoxicated beyond comprehension. I feel like I'll never truly know what happened and that alone is the most painful part.

We flew home a day early, and I just have no idea where to go from here. We've been together for 7 years, married for 4 years in just a couple months.

As far as I was aware, we're in a great place in our marriage, and there haven't been any issues with infidelity in the past. This is completely out of character - I'm absolutely crushed and deeply disappointed. He was reckless with our money, with my trust, with our marriage and it really fucking hurts. The fact we were on a solo trip together and instead of coming back to me, or doing literally anything else, he chose to go to a strip club.

I would love any insight + advice from those who've gone through something similar with their partners. Thank you for reading. 💛",1723672976.0,ThrowRA-72828,relationship_advice
Mom (64f) just got out of the hospital and wants to divorce my dad (67m). Encourage her to do it. Did I step over the line when I live so far away? How should I actually handle this situation?,"**TLDR: My mom's been fomenting bitterness towards my father for years. She had to go to the hospital and my father did the bare minimum to help her. I flew in from across the country, remembered how toxic living with my dad could be, and when she said she wanted to leave him, I told her to start by finding a divorce lawyer. Did I over step by giving such harsh advice when really my life is thousands of miles away?**

My mom and dad have been together for nearly 40 years. They definitely love each other in their own ways but I think the relationship is pretty toxic by todays standards. 

Maybe it’s something from their generation or maybe that’s an excuse I make for my fathers behavior, but the house runs as you might expect. My dad does not help clean or cook, and cannot shop for groceries to save his life, but of course he manages the finances and gives my mom an allowance for all of her needs + groceries. 

Beyond that, my dad can just be a difficult person to talk to. Any criticism or any comment that he interprets as criticism will immediately be met with hostility. He is very, very cheap and while my mom has access to their money, every dollar she spends is watched over and anything out of place will end up in a an argument. For years my mother has not spent anything outside of the allowance he provides her. But here's the thing, they are now both retired and have plenty of money in assets but most of their cash flow comes from my mom's pension. Beyond that for the final 10 or so years of their careers, my mother made more than my dad.

He is also cheap with his time. He does things he like to do, and that is it. If he doesnt want to do it, then it isnt happening. That means cleaning and sometimes even personal hygiene are things that just arent happening.

For this, I think my mom has pent up bitterness for years towards my father. She is on an anti-depressant. My father thinks it is because she works to hard at her volunteer center, but no one has said that to him. My mom tried to go to marriage counseling with him, but he refused so she went alone. 

I live about 3000 miles away and I know I could never live with my dad again either, so I have a lot of sympathy for my mom in this.

This came to a head for both of us when my mom fainted on Sunday and went to the hospital. She has been stable and awake the whole time, but her BP and Heart Rate were extremely low so they couldnt release her. Over the week when I called in she was almost always alone. My father would go in each day, but after 30 minutes to an hour would get bored and go home and watch TV, leaving my mom alone for the rest of the day. Finally Wednesday night came, my mom was still alone and still in the hospital with no real end in sight, so I booked a last minute flight and arrived on Thursday I'll be in town until Sunday morning.

Communication between my parents has deteriorated, and now I can see it first hand. My mom is so frustrated and hurt that she has become very distant from my dad and is often short with him. I do not think my dad really even notices...? Maybe he does so he is just trying to stay out of her hair. It is extremely unclear, and any type of asking would definitely lead to him becoming combative. 

I went back to my parents house where my brother (35m) also lives, and the place is not clean. Toilets and showers are completely gross. Floors and countertops are covered in dust and dog hair. Whole house has an odor that I'm all too familiar with from my childhood.

I sleep there in my old room, wake up, get ready to go back to the hospital to spend my day. My dad is at the kitchen table and I say:

Me: Think you can vacuum while I'm out so mom can come home to a clean house
Dad: I don't think thats going to happen.
Me: What?
Dad: We dont all have the same standard of cleanliness as you do
Me: Really, dude?
Dad: Yes really dude, its my house and I'm not going to do it.

Rest of the conversation goes absolutely nowhere, meanwhile I had just finished cleaning all of the poop off the upstairs toilet seat that was so caked on I thought it was just divots in the enameled wood seat. So the ""standard of cleanliness"" comment really took me to a place.

I get to the hospital, and my mom is telling me that she is so over my father. She is tired of having to ask him for money. Tired of not being able to do some activities with her volunteer friends because my dad refused to give her cash for the event. She is tired of feeling like dad and brother's caretaker. She tells me she is over it, and I tell her that the environment at home is toxic and I think she should get out too. My mom said she didnt even know where to start in leaving and I told her to start by finding a divorce attorney. 

Maybe that was it, maybe I've crossed the rubicon and thats that.

But this is where I need advice. I do love my father, despite being very selfish he was never a bad father. He was there for me growing up, and he loves my mom and me and my brother to the extent that I think he can love anyone. But that doesnt change how completely toxic and stressful living with can be. 

I have been extremely hesitant to tell my mom to get a divorce from my dad. In my heart it is something that I have felt for years. My mom has complained about a lot of these things for a long time, and I've always been sympathetic to my mom, but never have I explicitly said you need a divorce. It feels so wrong to root against my parents' marriage. It feels like I've turned my back on my father. But when he immediately turned combative over vacuuming (which is a 10 minute chore tops), I felt like there was no point. It was the first time in 15 years I think I saw with such clarity just how unhelpful, and miserable my dad could be and I didnt want my mom around it anymore. 

Was I wrong to tell my mom to get a divorce? Should I try to tell my dad that his marriage is falling apart? I'm concerned that would just lead to him confronting my mother about it, and then her being to scared to be honest with him. Should I just stay out of it because I live 3000 miles away and have no way of actually knowing what life here is like?",1693683957.0,Specific_Twist_3014,relationship_advice
My (18M) (step)mother (39F) wrote a letter to my 18-year old self when she married my father (43M). How do I even begin to thank her?,"My mother is not my biological mother but I will be referring to her as my mother in this post because that’s what she is to me. My biological mother passed away giving birth to me and I was raised solely by my father for the first three years of my life until he met my mother. I won’t be talking much about my father in this post. My father is amazing in every way but this about my mom. They got married months after my sixth birthday and they have had four more kids. My mother always treated me like her own and never let me feel like an outsider or like a “half”-sibling. I was always her son and big brother to all my siblings.

Yesterday, I had my 18th birthday and I spent the afternoon with my family and went to a party with my friends in the evening. When I got back home, everyone was already asleep and there was an envelope on my pillow. I opened it and it was a letter that my mother had written addressed to my 18-year old self the day before she married my father. 12 years ago, she wrote that letter telling me that she would never dishonor my biological mother’s memory but would try her best to be a mother figure to me. She promised to kiss my forehead every morning before I got on the school bus, she promised to always encourage my interests and would try her hardest to come to every practice and game of mine, she promised to never differentiate between me and any potential future siblings in any way and many more beautiful promises. She ended it by saying “You’re an 18-year old now - an adult and are hopefully heading to college soon and you no longer have any formal reason to maintain a relationship with me but I truly hope that in these last 12 years, I was able to be a loving mother and fulfill all my promises to you and I can only hope that you will continue to give me the privilege of being your mom because you will always be my son. I love you.” and had a picture my father took of her and my three year old self at a zoo.

Like my father, I’m a stoic but in tune with my emotions kind of person. This letter had me crying and I have not been able to stop reading it again and again and it’s currently 4am as I type this. My mother fulfilled every promise she made 12 years ago and I genuinely can’t imagine life without her. She opened her arms and heart to a boy who she had zero biological responsibility toward and has been the most loving and supportive mother I could possibly ask for. How do I even begin to thank her for everything she did for me? What’s something big or small I could do to show how grateful I am for her?

Update: 

Holy shit, I didn’t expect this to blow up. Thank you for all the kind words about my mom. When I woke up, I read some of the comments and went straight to my mom and told her everything I wrote in the post and I honestly couldn’t keep it together and cried a little bit. I told her that no matter what, she was my mom and I loved her. I told her how much I appreciated her for all her love and support and that I was proud to be her son. She also cried a lot and she just told me that she loved me and she’s very happy to have me around for a couple of extra months (I should be starting college in a few weeks but I’m committed to a college for football and will be enrolling in January instead and just taking community college classes and training right now). I’m planning to take her to the zoo and recreate the zoo photo and I want to give her some kind of jewelry. I haven’t figured out the jewelry part exactly but I will eventually. For now, I just want to cherish these last couple of months before college and help my mom around the house however I can. Also letters to our future selves is something I can get behind. Like a letter I write now and give to my mom before I get married or something would be nice.

By the way, yes, she already legally adopted me on my tenth birthday and I’ve been calling her mom/mama for as long as I can remember for those who were asking.

Also, a big fuck you to the people who privately messaged saying she didn’t fulfill her promises since there’s no way she could have went to every single practice and game. I’m pretty sure she didn’t know she was going to have four more kids and that I would end up playing three sports since middle school back then. Some people just can’t be happy or let others be happy lmao.

Wife(27F) and her family kept her affair hidden from me(31M).  Best way to go about it for me?,"Thinking about serving my pregnant wife with divorce papers at her parent’s house on Thanksgiving day. 

Backstory is that I’ve been married to this woman (Becky) for 4 years now. 3 weeks ago she meant the world to me. I would’ve done just about anything for Becky, but now I don’t even see her as a human. I’ve always wanted a family and she knew this before we got married. She also had the same goals in life for us. After getting married she decided that she didn’t want to be a mother, and I was hurt but accepted her decision. We purchased a small farm after getting married, and Becky decided that would be her full time job. We really were blessed to be living the beautiful life that we were living. Becky wants a Thoroughbred horse for six figures no problem. Becky wants to import a heard of Brahman cows, because regular cows look boring no problem. Becky wants a brand new diesel truck every year to drive into town no problem. I had no issue providing all of these things, because I knew her first love was taking care of animals. I knew that’s what made her happy. 

A few weeks ago her best friend (Emily) wanted to know if I was available to meet her, because she wanted to tell me something. I figured that she had a surprise for Becky and wanted my help or something. Emily came over to the house when Becky was away, and basically handed me a file with the evidence of my soon to be ex wife’s affair. Becky had been having a full 8 month affair with the married veterinarian. Emily and Becky have been best friends for over 10 years, so Becky tells her everything. Emily let me look over the file, and then told me about the affair. The highlights of the affair were that it was with someone who bills me hourly for thousands of dollars. The same man I see in church (where my FIL is the pastor) and shakes my hand while me and his wife are clueless. Becky and him sleep together in what is supposed to be our house daily. Almost every time Becky goes on a trip it’s with her lover and not her friends. Becky deliberately sent me 2 states away to pick up a trailer, so she could have the house to herself and her lover. All the new girly clothes and heels are for this man and not me. The icing on the cake is that Becky is currently pregnant with her lover and not me. I know this because she admitted it all through text to Emily. She admitted to keeping the truth hidden from me. Emily also knows her Becky had a conversation with her parents who are supposed to be very high ranking religious people in our little town. Her father who’s the pastor encouraged his daughter to keep the truth hidden about everything to protect their image. The worst part is I was so excited about this news, and now my friends and family know. I can’t believe someone can be this evil to do something like this. Becky has already started to set the room and make changes to the house. 

The thing is that it’s been weeks since I found out about this. I’ve used that time to get my ducks in a row for divorce. She has zero idea that I know what’s going on behind my back. I also took this time to confirm, and get video evidence of the affair. I’ve already hired my divorce lawyer who’s not even from our town. Luckily my state isn’t a community property state. According to my lawyer I will probably come out pretty well especially with all the evidence we have on her. I’ve already had a listing agent look at the house/farm and give me an idea of what I can get for it. 

My question is about my plan for ending this. For Thanksgiving we usually have a big service at her father’s church. I want to look into her father and mother’s eyes and have them lie to me about their daughter. My plan is to have the divorce papers served at my ex in-laws house right before dinner. Her entire family will be there from siblings to grandparents to friends including Emily. After she is served and realizes what is going on will be my time to leave. My best friend doesn’t think this is a great idea. I think he’s looking after my safety since most of her family carry, and he doesn’t want me to be out numbered. Personally I don’t think I’ll be in any harm. The other less exciting option is just to do this at our house, and see what happens from there. Not sure which route to go down. After this is over I plan on leaving this town and not looking back. As for why Emily is turning on her I believe it’s jealousy. Emily isn’t married and isn’t that well off financially. Emily could’ve told me 8 months ago, but waited all this time. I’m not sure what to think. If all this sounds scattered I apologize my mind is all over the place and lacking sleep.

My (27F) fiance (26M) set boundaries around what I can talk about with him. Is this healthy?,"Essentially the title. My fiance and I have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 8 months. Over the last 2 years, he’s ask me not to talk about or drastically limit how much I talk about certain topics, including: work, niche topics that I’ve extensively researched and really enjoy, and our wedding. Today, he added the cat I recently rescued to the list. 

This has severely limited the topics that I talk to him about and made me feel that he just doesn’t want me to talk. This is backed up by comments that he’s made about how monotonous and hard to listen to my voice is. 

Writing this out, I totally understand that I sound like a boring person, but he knew most of these things about me coming into the relationship (we knew each other before we started dating). 

However, I understand that those things aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. I used to talk at length about these topics, but I’ve worked really hard not to talk about them too much with him. I even set daily reminders on my phone not to talk about the topics that bother him until it became a habit. 

Initially, he said I didn’t need to set the reminders, but he was noticeably happier when I started talking less in general. 

Meanwhile, he continues to talk at length about the similar topics that he’s asked me not to: work and his favorite topics to research. When I’ve brought up what I felt like was a double standard, he said that anyone could understand and relate to his work, whereas he doesn’t understand mine. 

I’ve also made an effort to at least listen to and encourage his research topics, even though they’re not my thing, and he says that these are the only things he has to unwind outside of work, a physical, public-facing job. 

It does make me sad—I believe in encouraging people’s favorite topics, and I’d really love to have that reciprocated from my partner. Instead, the list keeps getting longer. When I want to give him important updates on my work (like that I’m going after another job), I have to preface my update with “I’ll make this quick” or “2-minute update,” and even then he looks like he’s been forced to endure. 

Several times, when those things (especially work, which has been especially rough for me this year) are all I can think about, I find myself with very little to say that won’t go against the boundaries he’s set, but I still want desperately to talk to someone. On those days/weeks, we’ll have very surface level conversations.

Especially then, I talk a lot to our 3 cats and now the rescue cat, mostly nonsense things about how sweet they are and silly made-up scenarios, and then we just slow blink at each other back and forth—it’s great. 

This upsets my fiance. He’s made comments about how he’d have to act like a cat if he wants me to talk to him and give him attention. I’ve explained that I’m just going through stuff at work, and don’t want to talk his ear off about it. 

I’ve tried having conversations about how to resolve this so we both get what we need, but he usually turns it back on me in some way. 

This can’t be healthy, right? Or am I overthinking it/missing something? We’re about 2 months out from the wedding, and I’m struggling to finish wedding DIYs because of what this would mean for the rest of my life. 

TIA for any advice.

ETA: Didn’t expect to get clocked this hard, but yes, there’s a chance I am somewhere on the spectrum. I haven’t pursued a formal diagnosis. He doesn’t believe he is and only fit 1-2 criteria when we looked a while back. 

Some additional info and clarification: I did previously talk too much (1-2 hours in some cases) about work and my favorite topics. I realized I was doing it after I suspected that I be autistic. This is something I’ve been working on really hard (re: topics aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, and I recognize that). I rarely talk about anything for more than 15 minutes now; 30 for topics where he engages, like when I tell him that I want to change jobs and how it could affect the two of us. 

My fiance has called me annoying before but says it’s endearing. 

Some people have suggested he might just be with me for chores and cooking, etc. I’ve taken over all of the cooking, but I really struggle with chores, but I’ve been trying to do better. I’ve improved gradually over the last several years. This is a main source of our arguments. 

I apologize for the length of the post. 

TL;DR: Fiance asked me not to talk about topics like work and hobbies. Adds to the list, but talks about his own interests the whole time we’re together or on the phone. I did use to talk for 1-2 hours, but I’ve worked hard to make sure I don’t talk that long now because I know it can be exhausting. I do engage and ask questions about his interests frequently.

"My childhood friend (30F), who encouraged me (30F) to leave my husband (30M), has been trying to proposition him.","I’ve been married for 6 years. I am currently 8 months pregnant.

My husband and I have been having some problems for the past year and things were getting increasingly worse. The issues boil down to the fact that my husband has a strong personality and has had the privilege of living a life where people bend over backwards to keep him happy, and he expected the same behaviour from me. I did it for the majority of our relationship, but I was becoming someone I didn’t recognise, and I was tired of playing a role and feeling like my husband loved the fake version of me and not the real me.  

I have a childhood friend “Emma” who I confided in and who gave me the courage to finally ask for a divorce. As expected, my husband told me no. My husband has always made it clear that our marriage was for life so he gave me a harsh reality check on what life would look like for me if I chose to try to force a divorce on him. After a week, which I spent the majority of the time crying in bed, he sent me to my parents because he thought the constant crying wasn’t good for the baby and I would be happier away from him.

I stayed with my parents for a month. They couldn’t believe I had asked my husband for a divorce because they thought we were happy the entire time. I told them all of the things which made me unhappy and while they were supportive, they also pointed out that I was being unfair to him because I jumped too quickly to divorce and I didn’t even give my husband a real chance to fix things. 

We started couple’s counselling at their suggestion. I found out during our second session that Emma was trying to proposition my husband the entire month I was staying with my parents. 

I just feel so stupid and like I can’t trust my own judgement anymore. I thought I could trust Emma and that she had my best interest at heart, but it turns out she was just trying to get me out of the picture. 

I don’t even know where to go from here. How do I ever trust my judgement again? How do I know when someone is being genuine? How do I make it up to my husband? 

TL;DR – Childhood friend encouraged me to ask my husband for a divorce. It came out in our couple’s counselling session that she has been trying to proposition him for the entire month I stayed with my parents.",1618258287.0,ThrowRAproposition,relationship_advice
I (25F) surprised my bf (26M) only to find his ex (24F) at his house. How do I handle this?,"I went to drop off my bfs favorite meal to him today only to find his exes car in the driveway. I rang the doorbell and he came outside and said ""I'm sorry"" ""1 just feel confused right now"". I remember cussing him out a bit, crying and saying I didn't know how he could do this to me when we had plans for me to move in in a few months, asked him what his plan was with all of this, and then told him the part that hurts the most is the lies and deception and he was lucky I wasn't a violent person because he deserved to get slapped... then I told him I would talk to him tomorrow because I realized she could see our entire interaction from his security camera monitors and I didn't want her to witness it. Now I'm wishing | said more, threw her out, etc. and I can't help but feeling like I want to forgive him because I love him but feeling ashamed if I do. Any advice on if this can be salvaged or if it's worth trying to? If not how do I move on from this? He didn't chase after me and I haven't heard from him... which almost makes it hurt more? She knew we were together and had asked if we could be friends and grab a drink 2 weeks ago.
I know I'm young and I live in a big city so I could find someone else but I really thought he was the one and my dad told me he thought so too before he passed away...

Small update: I spoke to him on the phone this morning as many has encouraged me to get things that I had bought for the house. I am on my way to get it this morning. He tried to get mad at me which at that point I told him he was a gaslighting narcissist who can enjoy his miserable life. I will give a bigger update if there is one but I appreciate all of the tough love and encouraging comments. As someone that loved him so deeply saying goodbye was something I wasn’t ready for but I know I’d rather not be anxiously dating someone I can’t trust. 

Final update: just got back to my house after seeing him. I held my ground as much as possible. I went in knowing I just wanted to get my stuff and get out because the more time he had to convince and manipulate me the more likely I would be to give in. He tried to tell me nothing happened and I just told him I didn’t want to hear it. I got what was mine and drove home and called my mom. I am still obviously upset. No one likes a break up but I’m excited to focus more on me. For those that believe in karma I did find joy in the fact that he got poison ivy yesterday after I found them.

I have a lawyer and a therapist. I’m working with both separately but at the same time.

My lawyer has advised me to keep my powder dry for now, so to speak. My state doesn’t have at-fault divorce, but how each party behaves can apparently influence a judge’s opinion on property settlements. So for now I’m keeping quiet.

So by way of update, once I do hit the go button on separation and divorce, it may now ending up taking down 4 marriages. I’ve been given the contact details of P1’s AP spouse and my wife’s AP’s spouse. 

I’m not doing this for revenge or to make myself feel better (because it won’t). I think it’s the right thing to do to let them all know what’s going on if they don’t know already.

My (51F) husband (forever 50M) died three years ago. How do I convince our children I do not want to ever move on?,"Shortly after my late husband celebrated his 50th birthday, he succumbed to his heart defect and passed away. He was born with a missing valve and we always knew there was a risk of an early death, but it hit me like a train regardless. He was and always will be my soulmate, and I wanted to grow old and senile together with him.

We have two wonderful children together, 20F and 18M. The kids were hit especially hard by my husband’s passing, especially our son who was very close with him. I have been there for them to the best of my ability, but it has been difficult when I spend each moment feeling like I have a hole in my being, as if I am missing the biggest and brightest part of me.

Our kids are my world. They have been my beacon of hope throughout this ordeal and I don’t know where I would be without them. They have noticed how utterly lost I have been since my husband’s passing, and have started to encourage me to rejoin the dating process. I understand this comes from a place of care and worry, but they continue pushing even when I say I am not interested.

My husband was truly my other half, I simply can’t imagine moving on and replacing him. He will live forever in my heart and I sincerely hope to see him again when I pass on. It is one of the only dreams I have left for the future. When our children tell me it’s okay to move on, I can’t help but feel I would be disrespecting his memory and the thought of being with anyone else fills me with disgust.

I truly have no desire to move on. I think I’ll spend the remainder of my life waiting to be reunited with my love. How do I convince our children I have no wishes to move on without being disrespectful to their concerns?",1728014659.0,throwra-1971,relationship_advice
I (43F) just had sex for the first time. How do I tell my husband (44M) that I want to end our marriage?,"

I have suffered from what my church terms ""same sex attraction"" my whole life. My husband has been my best friend for 30 years,  married for 25. He has felt asexual since as long as he can remember. Our relationship has been one of absolute loving, cuddly but celibate best friends, and while unusual, has been satisfying and worked for us. 

This weekend I attended my 25th high school reunion, about 4 hours from where we live. I stayed with ""Eve,"" my best female friend from back then. I'm not going into details here, frankly I haven't even processed it all yet...we made love several times. I had my first ever orgasm(s), I felt desired, I felt authentic, real, alive. Neither Eve nor I planned or expected this. I'm shedding a lot of self-deception,  determined to actually live my life now.

I'm ready to lose some friends and family, and being unwelcome at my church...but the thing is, my best friend/husband/confidant is totally innocent in all this, and for two days I haven't slept much, etc, and he's sensing something is weighing on my heart. How on Earth do I ask to just switch him to best-friend? This sucks. Thanks for listening or any advice.

Edit/Update --- Thank you all for taking the time to give me much to consider, amidst the deluge of hate and name-calling, there's been a lot of empathy, encouragement,  and thoughtful advice. Thank you so much. Many of you were correct in assumptions about me, and our marriage. So here's a bit more detail...I was trying yesterday not to make my post too long.

Yes, our marriage was very much to avoid the overwhelming stigma in our (raised-in) faith that goes with staying single, wanting to be chidfree, being gay, etc. We both had, and do have great affection for each other, but were not self-aware enough to figure that the social pressure was the reason for our young marriage, and be honest about it to one another until several years in. We've been comfortable about us in an open (privately of course) and honest way. We joke that we are like secret agents, with our own ""cover story""....our main one being that I am, sadly, infertile. 

I prayed every day since I was a teen for God to take away my same sex attraction, and then would pray for forgiveness for being angry at God that it didn't happen. My husband, in whom I confided about my struggle long before we married, has prayed beside me in this countless times, but has always been adamant that he prays for my heart to be at peace about the matter, not for me to change. That has always been incredibly meaningful to me, and I've always let him know it. Praying, for both of us, has increasingly lessened for several years now. Our church attendance is mostly pro-forma now. When I'm there now, I find myself looking around, and wondering how many others are also there ""just to be there.""

No, my husband isn't gay. He's funny, kind, always helping others, the real deal of a man. He's just completely asexual, and about a 9 out of 10 aromantic also. No one, but no one could ever have a better friend. We've discussed in the last few years (HE has brought it up) that perhaps I should have physical relationships with other women to be happy,  but I'd always shut that down. 

Very late last night he told me he knew something was really bothering me, that he had a feeling he knew what it was, and that we are going to talk about it, tonight. And then he held me for what seemed forever.

Wife (29f) made inappropriate comments toward my (29m) sister (24f) during a family event and now things are awkward between our families. Not sure what to do?,"Wife and I invited both sides of our family over last evening for a big announcement (""we're"" pregnant). In total it was my mother, younger sister, and grandmother along with both of my wife's parents, grandparents, and older sister/her husband and her niece. 

Everything went well with the announcement and everything; tears were shed on both sides of our family (mainly our parents and grandparents.) Everyone was talkative and basked my wife in questions. She was happy to answer and talk about the baby and our excitement (it's ALL she can talk about to everybody). My sister was engaged but didn't talk much; she isn't that much of a talker when in big settings, and her and wife doesn't have that deep of a bond (but she's always cordial).

I think my wife was trying to include her in the conversation and noticed her quietness, because eventually she turned her attention to sister and began asking her quite personal questions, specifically about her ""life and ""future plans"" (she still lives with my mother and is in between jobs). My sister just responded with, ""finding a career I like and finish writing my book (she hopes to be a writer). But even after this answer, wife kept prying. 

At this point things were starting to get awkward at the table. My mother tried to lightened the mood by basically saying, ""she'll get to where she needs to be in time."" My wife asked her if she had a boyfriend, and sister said no, and that she doesn't want one. I could tell she was getting uncomfortable, and I tried to change the subject, but for some reason wife just wouldn't let up. She said something about her being such a ""pretty girl"" and that she hopes that she can find a committed relationship, because intimacy and marriage will open her up ""true womanhood"". 

At this point I told wife that sister doesn't seem to comfortable by her questions and for us to talk about something else. Everyone was silent at the table, and I think that was what gave her the hint that she went too far. The subject changed, but for the rest of the night there was an awkward tension, and my sister didn't talk anymore at all, or say bye. 

Later last night once everyone had left I got a call from my mother. She was a bit upset at the fact that she felt like wife was “attacking” sister, and felt as if her questions were inappropriate.  I told her I would have a chat with wife. But my wife was actually upset too, because she felt as if the night was “ruined” because of the tension that happened after she was just trying to make “friendly conversation”. She said she was just trying to ""encourage her"", but I tried to explain that my sister doesn't have an interest in that stuff (sex or relationships) and it was odd to ask. 

 I honestly don’t think she meant any malicious intent with the things she said, she’s just a bit overwhelmed with the excitement and love she feels with being pregnant (I am too) but I tried to explain to her that it out sister in an awkward situation, and there are some things that people may not feel comfortable talking about. Now there is a bit of strain between her and I, and me and my family because of this. There have never been any issues between our families before. She doesn’t think she really did anything that wrong. Is there a way I can help her to understand my families perspective (and maybe vice versa). While she’s pregnant I don’t want to cause her undue stress more than what’s necessary. 

**tl;dr**: wife made a bit of an inappropriate comment/conversation with my sister during an important announcement dinner. Now things are a bit strained between our families and I'm not sure how to rectify it. ",1723425218.0,ThrowRA_strangejoke6,relationship_advice
My [M27] family wants me to break up with my girlfriend [F22] after how she responded to my brother's [M22] prank,"Hi reddit! Long time lurker, first time poster. I know how the title sounds, but i could honestly use some outside perspective since anyone else I could ask is biased towards the situation. I have been dating my girlfriend, Lola for about two years now, and overall things have been great. My brother Ian has always been pretty weird whenever she comes up or is around.
   Ian and I are very close, talking to each other daily, but the conversation will usually change gears right as I start talking about anything Lola related. I thought maybe he was jealous of the time I was spending with her or maybe a little crush on her.
   Still, whenever we'd get together, he'd make comments about our age gap, poke fun at me for simping, and joke about her sleep disorder. Ian's always enjoyed a good prank, either pranking or being pranked, he loves to laugh and I genuinely believe that when he goes to prank people, he means it in a way to share the laughter.
   When he's tried to pull little pranks on Lola though, he does things that he figured out triggers her disorder, like making sudden loud sounds, jumping out to scare her, and one time I caught him before he was going to do the shaving cream sleep bit while she was taking a nap in the guest room. I warned him in more detail then that he shouldn't mess with her while she's sleeping, as interrupting her regulated cycles isn't good for her, and AT THE ABSOLUTE BEST she's the WORST kind of cranky when she's woken up. Ian looked like he understood and I thought that was that.
   I threw a NYE party a few days ago and invited Ian and a bunch of mine and Lola's friends. Everyone was having a good time, my watch went off with the alarm that we set up for Lola to take a nap, she went off with a sleepy smile, I kept partying. A while later we all heard a scream, followed soon after by cussing and something breaking.
   I panicked as it was from my room where Lola was and I ran through nearly kicking the door down to find she shoved someone down and was yelling at them. I looked to see who it was and saw a spider mask that I unfortunately recognized as Ian's from years ago.
   I saw him scrambling to get away, but she only stopped when three of her friends pushed past me to pull her up and check her before she ultimately passed out in their arms. Ian scrambled off the floor and ripped the mask off, revealing the work she'd managed to do in the time it took us to react. He started bawling telling me that she was insane and abusive, that he only wanted to make sure she wasn't going to sleep through the ball drop.
   At this point everyone started yelling. Ian looked terrified and kept repeating that she was crazy and that I shouldn't be with someone who could do this to her bf's brother. Some of my guys were yelling that if she did it to him she could do it to me. All of her friends were screaming about how he should know to leave a sleeping girl alone and how it was creepy.
   Ian ended up calling our mom to tell him that Lola hurt him and she's furious, Lola's friends ended up carrying her out against my protests, and my friends were nearly split down the middle. I remember standing there while everyone argued while the ball dropped, my mother calling me for the tenth time, and Lola finally texting me that she needs space to think.
   Since then we've lightly texted, she's expressed that she can't shake her fear of what happened, but she still hasn't told me from her side WHAT happened. Ian and my mom are trying to convince me to break up with her, and chastising me for not helping or standing up for my brother when he was being assaulted, also demanding an apology for not playing my part as an older brother.
   Ian has facetimed a few other family members and now my aunt, who paid for both our colleges and the house my mom and brother live in and helped me get my apartment, is taking the three hour drive up to make sure her boys are okay, which is stressing me out even more.
   On one hand, i know family is family and I should do what I can to stand up for the people who helped raise me and become the person I am. On the other hand, Lola is my girlfriend, I adore her, I love her, I feel like I should be there to protect her. I don't want to push her boundaries but not talking to her is a different kind of hurt.
   Ian is convinced that he was doing a well intentioned prank and was wrongfully punished for wanting to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves. I don't know if i believe that, but I've known Ian for 22 years, growing up we were inseparable. I don't want to doubt him just because love may be blinding me. How do I approach the situation with Lola? How can I convince my family that Lola isn't a threat, she's honestly the most sweet and caring person, she just can't be woken up and part of me feels like she was pushed to that point.


ETA:

To everyone who has reached out to me with advice on how I can learn from this shitstorm, thank you. To everyone that has helped me understand that just because family has done a lot for you, it does not mean you're indebted to them and can't have an opinion or life of my own, thank you. To everyone that has reached out to me telling me that i'm such an idiot, I suck as a boyfriend, they hope Lola leaves me, they wish she beat both of us up, thank you.

This won't be a full update as a lot happened yesterday and I frankly don't have time to get into everything with police and packing to deal with.

In short, while a lot of you advised I wait for Lola to tell me her side before I confront my family, they all came over to my apartment yesterday morning while I was writing out a list of questions for them. I was supposed to go over the night before but i texted them saying I needed time and if we could meet later today, but they obviously didn't like that and showed up unannounced. The fighting started almost immediately and I initially was thrown off by them being there, but I matched energy and started yelling back at them for their predatory and enabling behavior of Ian and how I couldn't believe they'd side with him over this, golden rainbow baby aside.

My aunt got in my face about disrespect, while my mom cried and brother cussed me out, but I pointed at my computer and yelled back at them that if they genuinely believed Lola was the problem, then they were victim blaming idiots that I wanted nothing more to do with. My mom kept crying but I got my aunt's attention with the computer and she got close to look at the screen (i was going through comments to write up all the questions) and after a minute she turned back to us, really my brother, and said ""what is this?"" I explained reddit and that I'd posted for help, Ian then stopped comforting mom and pushed past me to get to the computer, asking what right I had sharing family business on the internet. My aunt stopped him and asked, ""Why didn't you tell us you were alone with her? You never told me she was sleeping.""

To say all hell broke loose would be an understatement. Like a switch my mom almost immediately stopped loudly crying and looked over at my aunt confused. Ian started shaking his head and reiterating his version of the story, which, listening to it, was infuriatingly off. I'd figured out that not only did he tell mom and our extended family a version of the story in which Lola was all too violent with him when ""he jumped from behind a door to give her a little spook"" but he left out the details that put him in any bad light. I started yelling again, calling him a liar, but he started crying and called me a liar who was just trying to lie for my girlfriend. At the sight of my brother crying my mom pleaded with us to stop, my aunt scrolling more on the screen. It felt like both a minute and forever that we were yelling in each other's faces about how the night went, how I felt he always used his tears to get his way, him yelling at me about how ungrateful I always was, etc. Unfortunately, I forgot where we were and didn't keep the volume down at all, and some time later there was a knock at the door. I didn't know who it could be, some dumb part hoped Lola, though I knew it wasn't. It was two officers, answering to a noise complaint from one if the neighbors. Feeling stupid I plainly explained that no one was hurt and we were having a heated argument but that no one was in danger. I did let them look around and talk to my mom and brother, but my aunt spoke up when it looked like they were just going to give us a warning.

""Actually, i think it's good that you're here, my nephew has something he'd like to report"" she motioned to Ian, who's eyes looked between her and the officers quickly. My aunt still looked as angry when she first arrived, but she was glaring at Ian. ""You know, hypothetically if someone touches or hits you without permission or justified reason, that's something you can and should report. Id there anything you wanna say?""

There was silence, eyes moving to everyone around the room. My aunt didn't look encouraging in a report, it hit me that she was calling him out. I stared at him, his eyes were bulging, he looked as panicked as the other night when he was trying to get away from Lola. One of the officers asked if everything was alright, and like clockwork, Ian started bawling his eyes out. My mom asked him what was wrong, I told her she had to stop babying him, he's been lying to you guys, my aunt asking him again if he had anything to report. ""You were up in arms against this girl this morning, where'd all that fire go? Did she hit you or not?"" It took a while of us pushing him, but he finally admitted to the room that he didn't have anything to report because he ""didn't feel like she'd be rightly prosecuted"". His next story sounded closer to the one I knew, where he admitted to knowing Lola had gone to sleep and wanted to scare her so she'd wake up (I still don't believe his reason WHY he wanted her up), that he put on a mask (I asked if he knew she had a phobia, he said he ""knew she found them creepy"") and that no, there was no one else in the room with them, he couldn't get any of our friends to agree to the ""prank"" so he did it himself. He  said he started making sounds against the wall the bed was against the wall and then got close to scream in her face. He said she woke up and surprised him because he thought the stress and panic would cause her to scream or hide but she went for his throat instead. He described his beating to everyone in the room, some of which I saw had the officers look at each other then back at him. Then that's when I pushed the door in (the door wasn't locked, i just panicked and didn't think to use the doorknob properly, i just threw my body at the door), and the rest of his story is what I was there for.

I'm sure if the police weren't there, I would've hit him. I know I would've. My mom started crying even more when he said she was sleeping, a fact that changed his entire story, and my aunt chewed him out, everyone scolding him for his stupidity and asshole behavior, while the officers explained that it sounded like if what he said was true, Lola acted in self defense, and that not only was what he did juvenile, but one of the officers asked my mom's permission to question him more as his behavior was concerning and they wanted to make sure he wasn't a danger to himself or others. My aunt and I told the cops he was 22 at the same time, an adult, and they didn't need her permission (he looks a lot younger than he is). Upon hearing his age, one of the officers sat down with him and asked him to talk through his thought process, and the other officer explained to my mom and aunt that Lola could press charges given Ian's story. My aunt still looked pissed while my mom cried about being confused and over her baby. My mom literally looked at me and said she didn't understsnd how her baby could do this. I already knew I was deep in the bullshit of this family, but i realized that i couldn't grow in the earth that poisoned me, and I needed to get away if I was actually going to get better and stay better. My mom kept fussing with my aunt and another uncle on the phone crying over the drama while I texted a friend of mine who lives across the city if I could stay with him. I was feeling overwhelmed with all of them and didn't want to be within a few minutes of the source of the problem. I also wanted to give myself space to think and understand with a clear head. I'm typing this between breaks of me packing. My aunt saw me in my room doing this, but she didn't stop me, she only asked me if I'd spoken to Lola about this, and I told her I haven't yet, but i had plans to later on. She told me she was sorry for believing my brother without listening to any other account and that she hopes Lola is okay.

So then it was just me in the apartment. The cops left after taking a statement from my brother and I, my mom left with my brother, still crying, my vrother calling me an asshole, the world's worst brother, and my aunt gave me a hug, apologizing again for how she and her sister acted, and told me that I don't owe her anything, but that she'd like to know that Lola's okay.

With everyone gone, I went to my friends house and i'll be there until further notice. He couldn't make it to the party but he heard about it from multiple people.

   As far as Lola, yes I did meet with her yesterday. As excited as I was to see her, I know that most of you were telling me she was going to break up with me so I'd been preparing for that. Whether I ended up single or not, I wanted to make sure she was okay above all. I know i don't deserve her as a girlfriend, and i'd much rather she not be with me if it meant she was safe.
   She brought a friend with her and we all sat and talked. I showed them both the reedit post and Lola has asked that I not share any more information about her until she feels ready herself. She's on reddit for gaming and general scrolling fairly often  and let me know that if she came across this story without me having told her, she would've been pissed. She did however read a lot of the commenters worried about her and wanted me to express to you all that, while upset, hurt, and with mixed up emotions, she is overall okay. She doesn't like that I posted about her without at least giving her a heads up, but after I offered to take the post down, she only ask that I give her time and to leave her, her personal life and opinions out of anything beyond what i've already said here until she's says otherwise.  In short, she did break up with me, and when I told her about the police telling us that she could press charges, her friend laughed and told me that they were more than aware. She thanks everyone for their concern and told me she really hopes we both learn from this. (This section was approved by her). 

So yeah, unless i'm forgetting something, that's all i have/can give right now. My mom has been calling and texting me, telling me that this ehooe ordeal has made Ian and her a wreck and she can't bepieve i'd let a girl do this to us. I blocked my brother right after he left my apartment, and i just blocked her. My aunt has let me know she'll talk to her, but i don't know hoe that's gonna go.
I understand that it isn't what everyone wants, but none of this is anything I want either. To everyone who has nothing but bad things to say about me, I get it, i'm an asshole. I appreciate any and all advice i've been given, I'm gonna be taking a break from not only the bs in my life but this reddit stuff tok. I know i have a lot of growing to do, and I can't do that in this environment. Thank you again to everyone.",1704240868.0,ThrowRA_Utonium,relationship_advice
UPDATE: My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I'm using his ex's words against him?,"Here is the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f2umej/my_28f_boyfriends_30m_ex_hid_a_note_about_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). 

As you can tell by my original post, I like to do things right away. It was definitely a mistake to bring him the note right away, but doing the things I did this morning right away was not a mistake as it allowed me to save my pets.



First, I want to respond to the comments saying I broke up a 2 year relationship over a note and chores. No, I broke up a 2 year relationship because when I tried to come up with solutions to an unequal situation, his response was to yell and try to convince me there was no problem except me. The final straw was when he physically blocked me from leaving the house after he was screaming at me. That is not okay and no one should stay with a man who responds to conflict like that. 



The actual update: I wound up texting the post to Natalia last night and she thought it was great. She, like some of you, asked me about the pets. For context, one of the things Steve and I connected on was our love for little creatures. It's why I thought he was such a great guy, because if he could take such intricate care of his lizard, he could do the same with me. I was very wrong. He has one lizard he bought before me and then we bought 2 frogs together. I have a snake I brought with me when I moved in. I was planning on waiting until he cooled down to go grab my things and the frogs and snake, thinking he would never hurt them, but Natalia changed my mind. She said he could get destructive when he's mad and was concerned about the safety of my little guys. I immediately knew I couldn't wait until later this week and reached out for a meeting with the landlord for early this morning.



I wound up facetiming with Natalia last night and we had a long discussion. Natalia is a lawyer and told me that in our state, landlords are required to let me get out of the lease I signed in cases of domestic violence. She also told me that his yelling, gaslighting, and refusing to let me leave are all types of abuse. It's definitely hard for me to sit with that, but the love is respect relationship quiz helped me also realize that a bit more last night. Apparently his constant messaging and control over what I wore and when were signs of abuse too. 



Anyway, this morning Natalia volunteered to come talk to the landlord with me alongside my brother. As soon as he heard the word lawyer, he was on top of it and said I could break the lease, but would still have to pay for all of August even though I'm leaving 3 days early. I felt like that was fair. He also messaged Steve to say the apartment needed to be empty for emergency maintenance all day today so I could pack my things. Steve messaged back that he was at work all day and wouldn't be home until 6pm. 



When I got into the apartment, it was a mess. He had broken my dishes that I had brought with me on the ground and left the shards laying about. My clothes were ripped up and scattered around our room. It was disgusting and heartbreaking. He left his lizard alone, but opened the tank doors for our frogs and my snake. Luckily the frogs were still chilling in their enclosure, but my snake had gotten loose. This made me the most mad, as she could have gotten cut on the broken plates. I feel so fortunate that she was just hiding in the closet corner and I was able to pack her up safely in her enclosure again. All my things are packed and I'm writing this as my brother drives me back to my friend's house right now. 



Natalia told me that she actually left 3 notes, one in the cabinet, one on the underside of the vacuum, and one in the crumb catcher of the toaster. While we were there, we checked to see if the notes were still there. The one on the vacuum was but it looks like Steve did clean out the crumb catcher at least once in the past 5 years. He never told me he had already found a note in our conversations, so it caught me by surprise. 

  
Natalia and I left the vacuum note as is and replaced the cabinet one. I wasn't comfortable leaving my name on a new note, so my addition was a handout on healthy vs unhealthy relationships and a qr code to the quiz that woke me up. (I'll put it in the comments, I'm not sure if I can have an outside link)



Natalia said if he didn't find the notes in those 5 years, especially after the move, he probably won't find them again. I'm inclined to agree, especially given he did find one but then didn't even clean the rest of the house to see if there was anymore. Steve doesn't make sense to me and seeing the state of the apartment really woke me up to the fact that I have no idea who he is. The Steve I knew would never put animals in danger, but I don't think I really ever knew Steve. 

  
To the people saying it's pathetic that I broke up my relationship because of chores and reddit, I encourage you to reflect on the subtle ways that abuse starts. This reddit thread woke me up to it and gave me the resources to get out safely before it got any worse. 



I also made an appointment for a therapist. I'm very lucky that my job has good insurance so I should be able to work through this relationship and am hoping to focus on boundaries and my people pleasing habits so I never find myself in this situation again. 

  
To the people wishing that Natalia and I would get together, we had a good laugh about it. Natalia is engaged to a wonderful man who cleans, listens, and reflects. She said there's a phenomenon that when people break up with their awful ex, their soulmate can quickly follow. I'm hoping that's true. Regardless, I do think I got a good friend out of this, especially since Natalia is a snake mom too. 

  
This is my final update. I hope if you learn anything from my experience, it's that abuse doesn't start right away. First there's love bombing, gifts, and pretty words. And then slowly, they test how much you'll put up with. You should never have to put up with anything, especially moldy freaking plates. 



TLDR: After ending things due to his behavior, Steve destroyed our apartment and let my snake loose, but I was able to get off the lease and get my things with Natalia's help. Now I am safe and am looking for a new place to live. ",1724855505.0,ThrowRA-ex-note,relationship_advice
My wife (37F) and I (38M) want to adopt our teenage foster daughter but FIL (64M) is furious about it,"My wife and I have two biological teenage sons, one older and one younger than our foster daughter. We have been fostering kids for many years but the goal has always been to reunify the kids with their parents which has happened successfully each time until now. Two years ago we took in our foster daughter, now mid teens. She had been through a LOT and was labeled as a ""troubled kid"" and not adoptable. I won't go into details, but the issue in this matter is that there are images of her going around amongst a certain community from before we took her in. We were informed by authorities about all of this before so it's not like this came as a surprise after we got to know her.

I'm not going to lie, it has not been easy. Our families have seen us struggle but almost everyone has been super supportive. The first 5-6 months were the hardest. She didn't trust us, and she was angry at the world - rightfully so. Then one random night I got up in the middle of the night and unintentionally ended up scaring her shitless, and she had a full-blown panic attack. She was ok after a little while but it was like something clicked for her that night. It was like she realized that we were on her side, and we watched her change from this angry and sad little girl to the ambitious young teenager we know today. It started with her telling us thank you for everything we did, small things like driving her to practice. And she said it with a smile on her face. It was so amazing to see her feeling better and not so lonely anymore. From there everything changed. She made new friends and got a lot closer to my sons, especially the older one. Her grades went from failing multiple classes to getting straight A's. Not because we were nagging her, but because she wanted to. Each member of our household has developed a good and strong relationship with her and the love we have for this girl cannot be put into words. We've reached that cosmic connection. She still struggles with a few things, which is totally fair after all she's been through, but she is working on it, and we are supporting her in every way we can. Overall she's doing amazing, she's so strong and I'm very proud of her.

We made the decision to fight the system to change their verdict from not adoptable to available for conditional adoption, because we want to commit to her for life. We want to adopt her. Last month we got the call that they changed their verdict, and we sent in our papers that were already ready and things are looking very promising.

The thing is we haven't told her yet. She knows that she is now adoptable, but we haven't asked her if she wants us to officially adopt her yet. My wife and I have talked to our sons about it, and they are fully on board. We talked to my parents, our brothers and sisters and their spouses. All of them have a good relationship with our daughter, and every single one of them is so supportive of our decision and willing to fully welcome our daughter into our family.

Then there is wifes parents... MIL hasn't been awful I guess, but maybe it's because I'm comparing what she said to what FIL said. We told them about our plan and asked them about their opinion. MIL asked if we were sure as our daughter doesn't quite ""fit in"". My wife and I didn't understand at all since our daughter has a very similar personality as we and our sons do. But it turns out she's concerned about the visual side of it as she's clearly not our biological child and people will start asking questions. The thing is, my wife, myself and our sons are very tall. Our daughter is not. She is tiny compared to us and has a similar eye color but not the exact same. All 5 of us have the same skin tone and colored and textured hair. Not that I think this matters AT ALL(!!!) but the stupidity of it is unreal! Apart from height she could pass as our biological daughter, so I'm starting to think this is a lame excuse for something else. I told her that people would ask questions no matter what, because even if our daughter was the spitting image of my wife, it's not like she suddenly gave birth to a teenager two years ago. And the answer to any question is very simple. ""She's adopted."" Tadaa! It's not like it could ever become a secret now, so I don't get it. MIL didn't say much after that but it was very clear she was not on board.
FIL hadn't said anything, but he didn't seem excited at all. I asked for his opinion, and he just stared at us for a minute, and then he said ""Don't do this to yourself and our family."" It's safe to say I was confused but I had no idea what to say. After a few more seconds he went off! He started talking about their family name, and he didn't want that ruined by a little wh**e and what would people think if they saw these images floating around on the internet.

I was stunned! My wife couldn't find any words either and started crying before she just left. I didn't say a word while FIL finished ranting but 1000 thoughts went through my head. Eventually he stopped talking and I still had trouble finding any words to say. I just told him ""you are sick!"" and I left too.

My wife is destroyed after hearing what her father thinks about our daughter. We have no idea how they know about these images as we haven't told anyone about it. I'm 100% certain my wife didn't tell them as their relationship is not that great. My wife is closer to my mother than her own so that wouldn't make sense.

We have tried to hide this from the kids since this happened, but my older son sensed something was very wrong and asked about it. I told him our conversation with ILss about adopting our daughter didn't go very well, and they weren't supportive. He wanted to know why. I told him I couldn't tell him, but that it was serious and promised to talk to him about it in a few years when he's an adult. And I assured him that our daughter didn't do anything wrong, our plans haven't changed and that it's FIL who is being unreasonable. My son told me that our daughter told him a few months ago that she didn't think ILs liked her very much, especially FIL.

This happened two days ago, and we haven't spoken to them since. I'm not sure I even want to try tbh. For me this is going no contact worthy. I want nothing to do with them. My wife is in pieces and has mentioned that she doesn't want them in her life after this. This has tainted our adoption experience for sure.

I'm afraid though that if we piss FIL off even more that he will start talking to our family about these images. I do realize that he will look like a pig in everyones eyes, but I would like to spare our daughter from everyone knowing about what's out there.

I usually talk to my mother about heavy stuff in life, but I cannot talk to her about this without feeling like I'm exposing my daughter by telling my mother more than I want to for my daughters sake.

Internet strangers... I have no idea what to do from here. How do I go about the situation with FIL without creating more mess than absolutely nessesary for my daughter?

Edit to add: Just to be very clear! There's no doubt in our minds that we still want to ask for our daughters permission to adopt her! Our relationship with our daughter will not change no matter what FIL does or does not do. I realized from the first couple of comments that it became unclear after the FIL incident. Sorry about that.

Edit to add 4h later: I'm glad to see I'm not the only one possibly/hopefully reading too much into this. I think you have verified I'm not crazy. Wife and I had a brief talk after I posted and have decided to talk to her brothers and sister first about FILs comments. It will be a hard conversation but it needs to happen. Before I could get to it, my wife told me she wants to report the situation with her father knowing about the images of our daughter. Right now we don't know what that looks like but it has simply not been possible for him to gain this knowledge legally. There is a culprit for sure, but we will leave that to the authorities for now.

"My (18m) girlfriend (18f) dropped out of high school, am I making a mistake wanting to end things with her? ","
My girlfriend dropped out of high school. We’re in our last year of high school and she doesn’t want to do it anymore because she thinks it’s a waste of time. Her parents tried to encourage her to see it through, even trying to bribe her with a new car so she wouldn’t drop out, but she didn’t care. She said she doesn’t like doing things she doesn’t want to do so she won’t dedicate another year to school. 

She doesn’t even have a job right now because she apparently can’t find one, not even something part time. She wakes up at 3pm, spends time with me and her friends, wants to go to any and every party she can just to have fun and pass the time. I asked her what her plan is and what she wants to do with her life. She said she doesn’t need to figure that out right now because she has a year of being 18 left in which it’s acceptable to not have a plan, and she will take it seriously in the summer once I’m done with high school and she can make a plan for herself which revolves around my plan and which university I go to.

Honestly, her carefree attitude to the direction her life is going is making me unattracted to her. I know that most kids my age are like this and as she gets older she will probably get it together and want better for herself, but I’m really struggling to even want to keep being in a relationship with her. 

I don’t know if I want to wait it out and see if she changes. My gut is telling me I shouldn’t waste either of our time by carrying on this relationship. I know what I want for my life and it’s not to have be with a girl that completely lacks ambition.

I don’t know if I’m being overly judgemental about this. What do I do?

"I (29m) want to have my kids at our wedding, my girlfriend (28f) doesn't. what do I do?","I have two daughters, 5 and 7 (both neurodivergent) from a previous marriage, which was fraught from day one starting well before the wedding. 
My girlfriend and I have been dating for a couple of years and started talking about getting married. When the subject of whether or not children would be present, I said that I at least wanted my kids there for the ceremony. She said absolutely no children, that she wanted one day where all of my focus was on just the two of us. 
From my perspective, we're joining our family and having my girls there seems natural, and conversely not having them there feels weird and wrong.
From her perspective, she's been through a lot of terrible shit, and having one day that is just about her and our love doesn't seem like a big ask. 

For context, my girls love her, and she loves them. She plays with them, engages with their interests, and has helped me navigate some of the rougher patches of co-parenting. 


Basically how do I navigate this? Our relationship has been rocky since this disagreement

Edit: 

There seems to be a solid consensus, and my initial feelings were on the right line. Not having my kids at my wedding feels wrong, and the responses have all been things I've thought and brought up. I guess there's a conversation I need to have tonight.

Edit+update:

There's some context that's missing behind our relationship that should be included. My girlfriend has known my family for almost five years. She has known my kids since my youngest was a newborn, and has advocated for both of them in areas I've been blind. She encouraged me to seek full custody (I didn't get it, but I ended up as the primary parent and decision maker) based on the behavior (with evidence) of my ex wife when they were still friends. Most of her behavior around the children has been fiercely defensive of them and their well being. In the original post, I did a disservice to the focus of our conversation. She has mentioned several times in these discussions that weddings tend not to be child friendly in general, and doubly so for Audhd children with heavy noise sensitivity and that do HORRIBLY with changes to their routine. 

Now for the update. We have agreed for now that a marriage is off the table indefinitely because we can't come to an agreement here. My next steps are to really investigate if my kids would actually enjoy being present at a wedding. I am my kid's safe person, and being told that someone else will be in charge of them (as some have suggested) for a whole day despite me being in the area would be difficult for them.

My (26F) friend (23F) injured my eye and I lost half my vision. How do I continue this friendship?,"I’m (26F) in dental school right now and my friends and I went to play badminton at school.

I was with one partner and we were playing really well. Then we wanted to rotate partners so I got paired with a girl, I’ll call her Dana. She doesn’t really play sports but it seemed like she really wanted to be my partner. So I said sure.

While playing, we bumped into each other a lot. I don’t think she’s very good at sports. When I called on the birdie she would still go for it. 

Long story short, we collided once more but this time she swung her racket directly on my eye. I lost my vision for two hours and I went to the ER. It was just grey. Nothing else.

But she was laughing the entire time, I feel like it was nervous laughter. I tried to stay calm and positive just because all my friends were there. We’re also going to be in the same class for the next 4 years and I didn’t want to create tension.

Either way I noticed the entire time she was just laughing. She went to the ER with me but she was still kinda nervously laughing. 

I had to go to the ophthalmologist next morning at 8am and the tests they did on me were uncomfortable and painful. It made me think about how I’m spending the one day during dental school where I could’ve taken a break, instead I spent it there and I was dilated that I couldn’t study the entire day. Everything was blurry for about 7 hours.

Doctors said I have damage on my retina and some bleeding in the back of my eye. My vision should return in 1-4 months, but there’s a risk this vision loss could be permanent.

And then there was a get together with the same friends and she was there. She was laughing the entire time again and joked about my eye too. She doesn’t seem to understand the severity of the situation and it irks me.

Now I want to ask her for compensation. Cover all my Uber fees going to and from the hospital. And my optometry appt fees.

I didn’t go to class today because my eye didn’t feel great and I didn’t want to see her face either. Today she went for sushi with our classmates and I saw the group photo and she’s smiling so widely, it bothers me even more.

I don’t really know how to handle this situation. I don’t want to create drama, or tension. I also don’t want to affect my relationships with my other friends in our friend group. But I’m fucking pissed man. And scared that this could be permanent.

How do I continue this friendship? I don’t know how to handle this. I don’t think her parents know either. I didn’t tell my parents because they’re going on a Europe trip and I don’t want to worry them when they finally got a vacation. I just feel stuck.

TLDR; my friend from school hit her badminton racket in my eye and I lost half of my vision. I want her to compensate. And I also don’t know how to continue this friendship without feeling bitter

—————-

Edit 1:

Omg I did not expect this post to gain so much attention. I’m trying my best to read everyone’s comments, so sorry if I don’t respond to it.

Just as an update: 

I reached out to Dana as some of you have suggested, and I asked her to compensate. I told her I wish to keep good relations with her, and that I’d like to be transparent about my situation. I told her that I have been paying everything out of pocket, which has not been easy, and it’s been a difficult time for me because this vision loss has been affecting my mental state as well. 

She said “yes of course! Let me know how much and I can send you what you need.” And then she sent me $200, even though I didn’t ask for any amount. She said that should be enough for now.

For some reason, her response felt…. Empty(?) it felt more like she was compensating for broken glasses. It sounded like she just wanted to send the money and end with it. But at least I know that she’s open to pay for the fees.

For the past few days, she has been going out eating sushi with friends, apple picking, and having a lot of fun.

She seems unaffected. I don’t need her to drop on her knees apologizing her heart out, nor do I need her to give me special treatment. But I’m not sure if this is appropriate to the situation.

If I hit my friend in the eye to the point where she has to go to the ER and lose half her vision, I would feel extremely worried. I don’t think I’d be able to think about going out. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for her. I told my close friends about it and they said the same. I know some of you have mentioned something similar as well.

So emotionally, I decided not to see her or treat her as a friend anymore. Just as a classmate. I saw some of you comment on that, and you’re right. She doesn’t seem like a friend at all.

It’s been a really hard past couple of days. I can’t see well in low light, my right eye vision would have a dark blind spot. But in bright lights it seems okay, just blurry. Adjusting to this has been hard, and it’s been harder trying to figure out how to tell my family afterwards.

So I really really appreciate everyone’s support and encouragement! It warms my heart. And it brings me hope that things will get a lot better.

Today I went to my family optometrist just as a check up, and the optometrist said that I will be okay, and I have nothing to worry about. He also saw the blood inside the back of my eye, and that I will have visual impairment for about a month or so. Fortunately, he already sees signs of healing. My eye starts to hurt if I use it too much though, probably because it’s trying to adjust to that dark area that covers the top half my vision. I’ve been keeping that eye closed when it starts to hurt. So I plan to use an eyepatch to relieve some of that fatigue. Unfortunately I’ll have to wear that during class as well.

I’m really glad to hear that this will only be temporary. I was upset about why this happened to me. But perhaps it was an early warning sign to stay away from Dana.

I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt. But I’m not sure if she deserves it.

To be honest, I don’t know if I want her $200 anymore. It feels like dirty money to me. So maybe I just send it back to her.

I might update more later. Thank you everyone for now

—————-

Edit 2:

I just wanted to add, I’m not sure how feasible it would be to sue Dana. As a dental student with a lot of student debt, I don’t think I’d be able to afford it. And perhaps this would be something to do if I lose my vision permanently, rather than the state I am in right now. Unless anyone has any further advice on this subject.

——————-

Edit 3:

I read some of the more recent comments and I see some people saying to take the money and get over it, or to stop stalking her social media.

I’d like to clarify, the photos that I’m seeing are ones she has been sharing in our friend group chat. I have not looked at her social media. Nor am I interested. 

It’s been 3 days since the accident. I’ve spent those three days at the hospital, ophthalmologist and optometry clinic. I missed out on the events and hangouts that were organized by my friends and school due to my eye, whereas she went to every single one. Even on the night of the accident. I also haven’t been able to attend class or study well. So she has been sharing how much fun she’s been having with our classmates. Which makes me question why she’s trying so hard to make me feel left out. Because she didn’t really share photos before. 

Again, I am aware that this was an accident. I don’t need her life to end or be miserable. I don’t need her to mourn or drop to her knees and apologize or anything. I just wonder about her intentions.

I don’t need her to be guilt ridden, but I would’ve wished for my friend to at least be concerned about me. I did not expect my friend to laugh when she hit me, laugh when I said I said I couldn’t see through that eye, laugh or gossip while we were at the ER, or still go out having fun, even at the night of, and post photos consistently in our group chat while I was spending those past few days going to the hospital and clinics worried that this was going to be permanent. Again, I don’t need her to feel super guilty, cry for days and not live her life. But just as a friend, I would’ve hoped for her to still be there for me. And her actions felt a bit insensitive for the situation.

I see some mixed responses as well. It seems to range from suing her, forgetting about it, or ending her dental career haha. I think I will just stick with communicating with her privately for now. And see how everything goes

And in terms of her money, I could just keep it like some of you mentioned. Just thinking about the future and long-term though, I hope that that $200 isn’t used against me by her. I think that’s my biggest concern. Some people in the comments raised concerns whether she’s a true friend or not. So I’d like to be cautious.

Not being able to see through half of my eye has been scary and an adjustment. I called my parents today and told them about my situation and they got really worried. But I told them I was okay and was able to end the conversation well. So I’m glad that part went okay.

I appreciate everyone’s feedback

—————

Edit 4:

I’ve been receiving some nice messages privately wishing me a speedy recovery, and I really appreciate it. It’s been giving me a lot of strength and positivity. I do not use reddit often, and I appreciate this supportive community. So thank you.

At the same time, I’m also receiving messages from people to f* myself and to grow up. I didn’t expect such responses as well.

So I think this will be my last update.

Thank you everyone for your support and feedback. I appreciate your positivity.

I wish you all the best!",1728068678.0,Level_Gur4795,relationship_advice
"My (30M) Wife (31 F) doesn't appreciate my bees, I'm considering divorce. What should I do?","My wife (31 F) and I (30M) have been married for 5 years now. I work mainly in accounting and personal finance advice while my wife is a math teacher at our local high school. Recently I have been researching and preparing to start a bee colony as I have been interested in bees for a long time and have recently reached a place financially where both me and my wife are able to pay bills and have bees. Before I did anything I spoke with my wife about my research and plan to get the bees, at first she had some apprehensions but we talked through them. Once we were both on the same page I found an artificial beehive and contacted a professional beekeeper to help with the bee process and so I began my bee journey.

A week or two later my wife comes home, while I'm making dinner, and tells me she invited a few work friends (all 31 F) over for dinner tomorrow. I say that's fine and continue making dinner until she requests that I move my beehive, the exchange went something like this.

Wife: ""While I clean the house would you mind moving your hive? It's an eyesore.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but what do you mean by eyesore? It's outside and has plenty of distance between itself and the house.""

Wife: ""I know, but I want it further back it doesn't match the house and I don't want my work friends thinking I let this house go into chaos when I'm not around.""

At this point I had finished dinner and was setting up the table when I asked her, ""why is this an issue now? Didn't we agree on the placement before I even got the hive? And besides it's hard to move a hive once it's been placed, where were you thinking of moving it?"" She responded that she didn't care she just didn't want to see it. After that we sat down for dinner and I asked again where she wanted me to move the hive, stating that the closest forest wasn't on our property and the second option would be by the back porch. My wife repeated her answer, that she didn't care she just didn't want to see it and we continued on as normal, we ate, we cleaned the house in preparation, did our respective night time routines then went to bed.

The next day my wife and I wake up around 5:00 am, do our morning routines, eat breakfast and head to work. Around 4:00 my wife calls me while I'm still at work, (the high school gets done around 3:00), I excuse myself from a conversation I was having with a co-worker and I go to a quiet corner of the break room. I pick up and my wife starts screaming at me that I didn't move the hive and now her work friends have to see my ""hideous"" bee hive. I try and get her to calm down by apologizing and saying I forgot and that I can drive over and move it quick, my wife cuts me off and says it's too late and she'll do it herself before she hangs up. I'm standing in the break room confused and angry so I try and focus on my work and deal with it later. I get home that night to my wife sitting at the table reading her book, she welcomes me home and I ask about her day, she says ""it was good, a little stressful but nothing I couldn't handle"". I then decide to bite the bullet and ask about the hive and how she handled it.

Wife: ""Oh yeah! Your bees I almost forgot, it was hard moving the bee hive because the bees kept stinging me so when I tried to set it down it fell and broke so I left it there because it is your hive after all.""

Me: ""You broke my hive?! How long has it been sitting like that?!""

Wife: ""It's been like that since I called you.""

I looked out of the window to see my hive laying on the ground, parts of the walls were broken as well as the legs and other crucial parts of the hive. When I took a step outside to get a closer look I saw my bees flying around unsure of where to go, I called the beekeeper contact and asked for a description of the damage. When I told him he said that there isn't much he can do but he'll call a friend to try and fix the things they can, I thanked him, hung up the phone and walked back inside feeling defeated. When I re-entered the house I walked upstairs not even glancing at my wife. I took a shower and cried, my dream of having a bee hive of my own was gone and there wasn't much I could do. When I got out of the shower my wife was already in bed, I crawled in next to her and laid awake for hours questioning our relationship and ""if she really loves me why didn't she leave the hive alone?"" I have been contemplating divorce as I realized that after she destroyed my hive she has never once apologized nor does she seem empathetic in the slightest, I tried asking for an apology and all I got was ""why should I apologize for doing you a favor?"" I never asked for an apology since and I'm wondering how I never noticed this behavior from her before and I don't know what to do. Deep down I still love her but she also can't understand why I'm so upset. What should I do?

TLDR: My wife of 5 years destroyed my dream beehive, never apologized and sees it as a favor. What should I do?",1714849477.0,ThrowRA-Serious-Bee,relationship_advice
I think my (30F) naked impression of a rhino has given my girlfriend (33F) the ick. How do I come back from this?,"I woke up to a chilly morning today and beelined to the shower, wanting to warm up as fast as possible. I turned the water on, stripped down, and put my hand out to feel if it had heated up yet. 
It had not.

In order to conserve heat, like the knowledgeable survivalist I am, I thought it wise to crouch down into a ball to minimise my surface area, and to keep reaching into the shower occasionally to see if the water was warm. 

Now, ordinarily I don't mind when my girlfriend comes into the bathroom if I'm in the shower because it's all very expected and normal. I'll be showering upright, she'll have a little tinkle, and everyone retains their dignity.

But today was not an ordinary day. While she had woken up and pursued her regular routine, I'd awoken and chosen Gollum. She walked in, sat on the loo, and then saw me: a squat, corrupted flesh-sphere, splashing in the shallow end of the shower tray.

I saw myself through her eyes and a shiver ran through me. However, I saw a way out: comedy. I remembered a tweet that I had never thought about until I found myself in this position and decided to pass it off as my own.

I asked her, ""do you ever get on all fours in the shower and pretend to be a rhino, moaning pleasurably in the first rains of the year?""

Before she had time to tell me that, no, that's unusual, I doubled down. I crawled into the shower and mooed enthusiastically like a grateful little rhinoceros.

I saw something die in her eyes. She flushed and walked out the bathroom.

We both finished getting ready, avoiding eye contact, and left for work.

How do I come back from this and rescue my image as a being with an ounce of sexuality and dignity?

Update: I showed her this post and it turned out she was so groggy first thing that she didn't even remember the grateful rhino bit. Thanks to everyone for being so kind and encouraging to build up my confidence to circle back to it. Here's to many more rains!",1705478130.0,SquidgyBubbles,relationship_advice
I (27M) don't want to hang out with my trans friend (25F) anymore. What do I do?,"This is a throwaway because my friend is also a Redditor.

A little backstory; I moved to a new country a little over an year ago. This was when I met my friend ""Kara"". We became pretty good friends very quickly and I appreciated the fact she was a friend in a new place where I knew no one. A year on from meeting her we've only gotten closer.

Kara is a trans-woman who had begun the process of transitioning almost a year before I met her, but she was still ""very new to the lifestyle"" (her words not mine) when I met her. Because of this a lot of the things we spoke about initially in our friendship were very centered around her transition and first steps into openly queer life. She admitted there weren't a lot of other people she could speak about this with and she enjoyed finally having someone hear her out, while I genuinely enjoyed learning about Kara's POV and experience as a trans woman. I also encouraged her to share other things with me such as her tastes in music, art and generally what she likes to do for fun (all of which are very queer). We often go to a lot of events together, we hung out at our city's pride festival and see each other a couple of times a month for drinks or general hanging out. I wanted to be someone she could celebrate herself and identity with and I think I accomplished that.

The problem is I think that identity dominates our friendship now.

When we hang out, Kara will insist on listening to her kind of music (lots of indie rock, queer artists and sapphic bands) a lot of which I don't really vibe with, but I never say no and don't complain when she does. However whenever I play my type of music (dad-rock, rap, afro-soul, rnb) she may listen to one or two songs before changing it to her music again claiming she ""wants to show me a new artist/song"".

I let her vent to me about her frustrations with work and her struggles in her romantic life. I even sat with her and let her cry on my shoulder when she broke up with her most recent partner, spending two hours consoling her. However when I try and speak to her about my frustrations she seems to get this glassy look in her eyes and she'll murmur a few affirmations before changing the topic to her experiences, because it reminds her of something she went through.

These are just a few of the many one-sided experiences I've had with Kara. I know she's a good person and I know it's unfair but I've started to resent her and her ""queer-ness"". As someone who's recently discovered and accepted my own bi/pansexuality, I understand how important someone's identity is to them, and I would never want to be someone who makes others shrink themselves to make myself feel seen or heard. But I've caught myself thinking things like ""enough with the trans talk"" or ""another lesbian indie band?"" recently.

I really hate that I feel this way. I don't want to hate who my friend is, or despise the things she likes, believes in and relates to.

How can I tell her this without her thinking I'm a giant transphobe and shunning her identity?

How can I fix this?

PS: While I appreciate all views and comments, I'd especially love the trans and queer people in this sub to weigh in as well.


EDIT:

So this post really blew up overnight and I can't thank everyone of you enough for taking the time to comment and share your thoughts and advice.

Thought I'd address a few things I've been seeing in the comments a lot.


- Is Kara neurodivergent?
Short answer: I don't know. She's told me before she's suspected she may be on the autism spectrum but has never tested for it. She is a little awkward naturally and has told me it's harder for her to make friends before, but I never really considered that had to do with her being neurodivergent (though it very well could be).


- Maybe Kara is trying to relate to me by talking about herself?
I'm 99% sure this is the case and is a big reason why I made this post. I felt guilty for having negative feelings resulting from (what I assume is) her trying to do a good thing.


- Have I ever voiced these feelings to her?
While I have said things like ""I don't really want to listen to this kind of music right now"" or ""I really want to talk about this"", she seems to hear me out initially before eventually (sooner rather than later) switching back to her kind of music or her kind of topic. But admittedly, I have never voiced how this reaction has upset me or made me feel before.


- I have ""people pleasing"" tendencies.
I agree. This is something I have struggled with for years. I've gotten better at it as I've gotten older, but I still carry a lot of trauma and fear of abandonment from some negative experiences resulting from me voicing my emotions and setting my boundaries, but it isn't an excuse.


I'm going to do what a lot of people are recommending and speak to her about how I've been feeling. I've realised my problem was never about her gender identity, queer-ness or lifestyle. In fact, even though I don't vibe with a lot of her music, I've discovered some artists and songs I really enjoy thanks to Kara. And her sharing her experiences has genuinely helped broaden my mind and thought processes about the world. I don't want her to stop sharing those things with me. My problem was feeling like my interests and emotions weren't ""heard"" or ""seen"" as much as hers. But it's not Kara's responsibility to sense and voice my feelings for me.

We'll be hanging out over the weekend so I'm going to try and bring it up to her then and hopefully it goes well (and maybe I'll even post an update after).

How do I (28F) move forward from a disappointing proposal from my fiancé (M27)?,"My fiancé and I have been together for 8 years. As a whole we have a great stable relationship but I can't move past my constant disappointment from his proposal. 

I didn't receive a this is why I love you speech or a grand gesture of asking me to marry him, he never even got down on one knee(not that it's the end of the world but it's just painting the picture). 

It was the last day of our camping trip, that I really thought he was going to propose during. That evening he only wanted to go fishing so I sat in my kayak probably 7ft away and cried to myself for over an hour that it wasn't going to happen since he didn't propose at any beautiful hiking view points or sunsets through the week and we were leaving in the morning. 
When we brought the kayaks in after fishing until dark he went to the truck, came back and handed me a ring box saying ""this should make you happy"". 

I booked the same campsite on the same lake on the same day this year and hinted over and over again that he could make it up to me. He did not even acknowledge the anniversary of our engagement. We are to get married in August but I can't move forward from this. I cry when friends get beautiful engagements,  I cry watching romcoms. I feel nothing but disappointment that I will never experience the gesture of love I dreamed about my whole life. Any time we have a disagreement or I feel unwanted by him I am just reminded of the disappointment I feel in regards to the proposal.  I don't even enjoy looking at my beautiful ring because it doesn't bring me a happy memory.  

This feeling is clouding how I feel about him, even though he has never treated me poorly and is my best friend. 

I don't want to ruin my relationship over this but I don't know how to move on. He said he can't change how things happened, which is true but it's been over a year and I can't seem to move past my disappointment.

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments, no matter how harsh or hard to read they may be, I have read all 900 of them. At this time for my own mental health im going to have to take a step back and think about what I really want for my future.

**EDIT2: I would like to add since hundreds of comments are stating my expectations are too high that I never wanted a grand gesture or a Hollywood proposal but rather a few words of affirmation and proof that I mean enough to him that marriage is obviously what he wanted. 

Additonally we have spoke at length about my disappointment from a lack of romance here and in other aspects of our relationship.  

Finally I did not destroy our camping trip or whine the entire time as many suggested. I never brought anything up for the 8 days we were gone on a trip I planned. This wasn't a trip he poured a ton or time or money into as people are suggesting but rather we are avid campers. I cried the last night as he encouraged me to take a job which requires being away from him that morning and after finding a ring prior to the trip but not receiving it before our trip was over I was quite devastated. Not my proudest moment but i cried to myself,  not to him and nor was I obviously upset for the HOURS spent fishing (an activity that I hate) but rather shed some tears while tossing a line on my own for a while.

I suggested proposing to him a few times over the years and he HATED the idea. I wasn't going to do something he wouldn't be happy with just to speed things along for myself .",1699476065.0,Temporary_Wish_7261,relationship_advice
I’m (25f) considering aborting me and my bf (27m)’s baby? ,"I’m currently in my first trimester with our first child (my second tho!) and I was in the hospital all day with my toddler today because apparently I had twins and I miscarried one. My boyfriend is off on a fishing trip with his dad a few states away. I messaged him throughout the day and he was sort of supportive but obviously distracted, and after, I was finally released I called him and he kept complaining about how he had a headache. I had to go through an entire day of ultrasounds, medicines, handling a toddler in the hospital, terrible nausea, tons of blood, and I didn’t even get to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner. He wouldn’t even talk or text me more than a couple words… 

And I get he’s on fishing trip but it’s a two week long fishing trip. He can spend a half hour in the evening on the phone with his girlfriend who’s in the hospital, right? 

Like I just wanted someone to talk to. I’m not far enough along yet that I feel comfortable telling family or friends yet so he’s the only that knows. And he’s just not been there for me. 

I don’t want to be dramatic but we’ve had prior issues with him neglecting my feelings and us having fights over him seeing my chores around the house and whatnot as nothing basically. I realize he may grow out of it but I’m really terrified I’m gonna have a kid with a man child. I’m gonna be left in the hospital with just surface level or no encouragement and then I’m gonna be stuck doing everything for 18 years. I already am stuck with my ex who isn’t involved and I have to fight to get child support just to get help paying daycare costs. I don’t want to ever do that again.

"My (23m) parents (46m, 44f) had a DNA test on my eldest daughter","My wife, Jane (22f), and I have two children. Our eldest, Melissa 4. Her conception was under horrible circumstances. We decided to keep her regardless and didn't test. Obviously I didn't explain everything to my parents and Melissa's my daughter no matter what. Unfortunately as she's gotten older she doesn't take after my side, and my parents, especially my father, did not like this. She looks like Jane's side so I've always told him that. Even if she was mine biologically she could look the same, even if less likely. But he thinks it's unnatural for her not to look like me at all, even if it's possible anyway.

He's never said it to our kids and I thought he had dropped it. But last month he decided to do a DNA test. I assume they need parent consent so he must have done something sketchy for it. Unfortunately Melissa didn't match him. I was furious because I'd told him to drop all this talk before. I've told him that if she somehow wasn't mine by blood I know about her birth and she was still my daughter either way. But he was trying to prove that Jane was a whore and I was being manipulated. I tried to end all this, but in the end Jane admitted everything. To be clear I did not want or encourage her to do this. At this point I was saying we should cut them off if they keep this up, she naively thought it would help. Obviously my parents don't believe it and are butting to 'help me'. But they're ignoring everything I'm saying at every fucking step. 

At this point I'm starting to think I want to cut contact. But Jane feels guilty for causing all this even though it's not her fault. They're the only grandparents our kids will have, but I feels it's not worth it to put up with this. Is it just an overreaction? What would be a better approach if so? How can I make them understand I'm not being manipulated?",1700839483.0,ThrowRA-7737-,relationship_advice
"My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) were on the brink of breakup. Several months later, were back and better than ever! *encouraging post*","Hey everyone. So... far too often on this sub I see people desperate to fix their relationship. More often than not, people will encourage the OPs to leave their relationships. 

This was my experience as well. I posted here several months ago from my other account and I was encouraged to just give up and move on. I didn’t and I thought I’d share my story for those of you who are currently in the situation I was in.

To clarify, there was no abuse, cheating, etc. if that is your situation, please do not use my story to hold on hope. Abuse is NEVER okay. Okay now back to bizz.

Background: 

My Girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 6 years. About a year ago, we moved to a new city. The stress of the upcoming move had slowly began to eat away at our relationship. The months leading up to our move, it was apparent that our relationship was in trouble. Nonetheless, we decided to go forward with our move, hoping it would be a fresh start and a new beginning for us. 

Wow. What a great thought that was. Nothing at all went to plan once we arrived. Yes, we both got jobs and the financial stress disappeared but our relationship was going off the rails. It was as if we both began to blame eachother for everything bad that would happen and we both became very resentful towards eachother. It’s as if we were mirrors that would just project and amplify our growing emotional distance and blame back and forth. 

One day, it was too much. She was actually the first to say it. She said that she had been thinking about breaking up. I knew it was true but it still hurt all the same. I felt similar but I wasn’t ready to give up yet, although when she said that I was ready to accept it. 

5 years of our lives spent together. 4.5 of which were very happy and loving. My heart ached like I can’t explain. Anyway.. this conversation happened after a night out. We had shared a bottle of wine and we’re both emotional so we decided that we shouldn’t make any final decisions in that state of mind. 

The morning came and we decided to address the situation. We still felt the same. There were tears and right before we were about call it quits I said something along the lines of “stop! I hate that we are here but I still love you”. She reciprocated but our flicker of hope was almost gone.

I got her an airbnb for 2 weeks. In this time we did not talk, no communication at all. I was worried that this was the dumbest idea I’ve ever had. The weeks were rough. Very rough. So many thoughts going through my head. 

The two weeks ended and she came home. I had never been so happy to see her. This surprised me, before she left I almost couldn’t stand to see her. 

We talked for hours and we had the most honest conversation I think we’ve ever had. We both talked about the situation, how we felt and why we both felt that way. It became pretty clear that we were neglecting eachother emotionally in different ways. 

Since then, things have gotten better. At first it took a lot of effort to look myself in the face and accept responsibility for my part in it. Every day, I did my best to make her feel loved, thought about, cared for, something that I had stopped doing so much after years of being together. She did the same with the issues that I raised.

Today, we are so healthy and our relationship is almost effortless. I’m honestly happier than we were before when things were good. Probably TMI but even our sex life is through the roof. It’s been about 8 month since we almost broke up and each day brings its own challenges but we’re now taking our relationship in stride as a team. 

If you are in a rough spot in your relationship, consider taking some time apart. Consider being honest with your partner and with yourself. Own your mistakes and try to improve. 

TL;DR- gf and I almost broke up and we figured out how to make it work. I hope that if you’re in that situation, you can too.

Edit: Wow! Thanks for sharing all of your stories. I knew that there were other couples out there that still love eachother but are struggling. 

There are a few trolls implying that she went out and screwed around during our break. To clarify, this is not true. We remained monogamous. We took a break from eachother and not the  relationship. If either of us had used the break to sleep with someone else, we would not have worked out.

Husband (38M) is resentful I (36F) find people in the poly scene unattractive; how do we get past it? ,"My husband and I transitioned from monogamy to polyamory two years ago. So while we are each other's primary, we are allowed secondaries as well as more casual relationships.

Husband and I have reached a block because he doesn't approve of my partners. I'm an attractive woman and I literally get thousands of likes if I hop on a dating app, even men wanting to fly me out, and a lot of trash to sift through. I expected attention but not as much as I got.

My husband has encouraged me to go on FeelId or Fetlife or even link up at the poly community meetings.

I've told him I'm not interested and I prefer to use conventional methods to attract a partner like being in person or on a dating app instead of poly specific social scenes.

He's pushed and pushed until I finally admitted after a lot of badgering that I find the people in the poly scene very physically unattractive. I'm also not interested in a swinger setup which has more conventionally attractive people.

It was like I ran his dog over. He's always been very insecure about his looks. I fell in love with his personality, not how he looks, but for a secondary or for causal relationships, physical appearance is important to me. I like the men I like.

He keeps trying to push other men who are in our local poly scene onto me, and they're all unattractive.

My wife (F24) and I (M27) disagree with her parents (late 50s) on what our child should call them. How should we move forwards?,"My wife’s parents out of the blue decided a while ago that they wanted her dad (our child’s grandfather) to be called “Papa” instead of “Grandpa”.

We both felt uncomfortable with this, as Papa means “Father” here. She spoke with her parents, and they dropped it. 

Today, we went there for Easter, and they started again with “Papa”. My wife said “no, it’s Grandpa remember?”, and her mother said “no, it’s Papa. We’re going with Papa”.

The entire time we were there was soured by this. My wife didn’t want to cause a scene in front of our child, so just gently corrected each time - only be to be ignored, or countered with “Papa” again.

My wife called them afterwards and explained again, and they’ve made it clear they will continue to encourage our child to say “Papa” against our wishes. We can no longer trust that they will respect our boundaries, and are astounded that they would just straight up say no and continue. Any ideas on how we should proceed?

Update:

Spoke with FIL - turns out, he prefers Grandpa anyway. He mentioned it to MIL as a friend is called that by their grandchildren, she then insisted upon it because shes “stubborn” and didn’t like that we said no

To answer the most common questions:

My wife was estranged from her parents for a long time, due to behaviour from before we met. 

He originally chose Grandpa, Papa came from out of the blue very recently.

My children are 4&2, I was being overly cautious with anonymity.

My children do not call me Papa, except when playing around (with a Victorian child’s accent, think Oliver Twist). ",1711905299.0,LabAntique8440,relationship_advice
Update: My 23M boyfriend held me 19F underwater during a bath to prove a point and I’m still shaken?,"Hi. I just wanted to let you know that I'm away and safe. I tried to log in 2 days ago to update but foiund that my account has been suspended. Maybe I did something wrong while creating it or mentioned some details I wasn't supposed to. But I'm okay now and wanted you to know because I'm really grateful for all the advice and support I received that I wasn't sure I would find anywhere else. (If my update is too long. You can just stop here because the rest is just what happened in detail)

I'm currently staying with a woman who used to be one of my neighbors before I moved in with him a few months ago. She's the only person I could think of calling for help and she didn't hesitate to come right away to help pack some of my things and leave. She also encouraged me to call my family. I called my mom two days later. She promised to not tell my siblings or my father (my parents are divorced). I told her everything and she asked how she could help. which was something I wasn't actually expecting. (The main reason I was hesitant to let my family know is because of both my older sister and my father. They always brings up things people feel ashamed of or bad experiences they've had just to win arguments)

As for my ex he apologized. Said he meant nothing by what he did and promised never to do it again. But just 3 days after leaving him. He tricked me into meeting him through one of his friends. She said he packed the rest of my things and asked her to give them back to me. I went to meet her (in a public place that I insisted on) and he was with her. We didn’t talk because I left right away before I even made it to their table.

Since I blocked him the day I left. My neighbor called him and let him know that she has no problem helping me get a restraining order if he ever tries anything. That’s all. I’m safe and I know now that I did the right thing. I'm glad I called her. I found a place with two roommates that I will be moving to next week. Although she said I can stay as long as I want but she’s already done so much for me and I don’t want to feel like I’m taking advantage of her kindness. Thank you again for all the advice❤️


>This was my Original post few weeks ago

I’m 19F and have been with my boyfriend 23M for over a year now. We come from different countries and religions but we’ve made it work. I have to mention this. My boyfriend loves turning everything into a competition. We both go to the gym and he's always like ""who can do this better"" Even at home he’s always asking who can cook better.. clean faster.. you name it.

A week ago we were relaxing in the bathtub together. He asked who I thought could hold the other underwater the longest. I found it weird and just brushed it off as one of his usual questions. Just 2-3 minutes later he got up as if to get out of the bathtub and suddenly pushed me underwater. He kept me under for what felt like more than 20 seconds. When he finally let go he started laughing.

I’m generally healthy but I have a heart condition that requires daily medication to keep my heart rate normal. Without meds, my heart rate can go up to 140-150 bpm. Even with meds, sudden situations like this can make my heart rate spike to 140 and stay between 110-120 for the next few days. He knows this.

He brought up what happened today and said he apologized (which he didn’t) and that I should get over it. I'm trying. He said he was trying to prove a point. That I need to work on myself more. It doesn't make sense to me because he’s naturally stronger than me and no matter how much I work out. I can’t always defend myself against everything successfully.

I can’t talk to my sister or mother about it. They’d just ask what I was doing in a bathtub with a guy in the first place. And I still don't have friends here. It's only him and me. We’ve talked about it more than once and he says if I did this to him he would've found it funny. I don't know if I just need to loosen up more but I don't understand how holding me underwater for that long was ever funny in his head.

Edit: He’s also complaining now about the marks I left on his wrist/arm (almost faded). I didn't mean to. It was sudden and I swallowed bit of water and I was freaking out and just wanted him to let go. I apologized for this but told him it was a natural reaction to what he did.",1723657358.0,ThrowRaa1923,relationship_advice
My husband (33m) is the reason I (28f) can’t have children and now he’s cheated I feel like it’s because of this and I don’t know what to do.,"Apologies if this is unreadable or disjointed. Im not sure how I’m feeling or doing right now.

An accident cause by my husband left me infertile. I’ve come to terms with it, and had always wanted to adopt so it wasn’t the worst thing that could have happened (this was 3 years ago). 
It was an accident related to negligence on his part. And though I try not to remind him or bring it up ever, including my own pain at my infertility, because I know he feels guilty, it is…very much his fault. There’s no way around that fact. If dealt with the anger I had with my therapist and she and I believe I am successful at not letting it bleed into my daily life with him. 

So yes, I’ve gone to therapy. No, I am not…or was not resentful. We have decided to adopt, and finally after two years, I am very happy to have a baby that will hopefully be coming into our home. We found this out a month ago. I thought we were both happy and on here same page.

Also, I should add, We never told anyone about why I was infertile. I never even told my parents (they think it was just a random accident) because we were worried about how it would affect their opinion of him. He also begged my not to tell my friends, when I just wanted to tell my best friend, for support. The only ones that know, are the people who have access to my medical files, my husband, and my Therapist. 


I don’t know if that’s necessary context, but right now it feels so necessary.



2 days ago I found out he is cheating. A woman dm’d me a photo, I’m going to assume after seeing my text pop up on his phone. Because it was within 5 minutes of me texting him that morning. It is an image, not really graphic. But they are in bed together, and **it is** my husband, for sure, along with a message that said ‘if this is your man he’s a cheating POS’. 
I haven’t responded to her. I don’t know how to. 

It’s from the hotel her chatted me from a night prior. I recognized the painting behind the bed frame because we talked about it. He is supposed to be on work tip.

I feel like the only reason I’m calm enough to type this out is because I’m in shock. 

I loved this man. With all my heart, I protected him from hate and blame. All I wanted was the same love and support back.

Maybe this is a validation post. But I need some advice on how to approach this, because I haven’t even cried yet. He won’t be home until tomorrow. And I have so many things on my mind. Im worried this isn’t their first time he’s cheated. I hate the idea he’s cheating because I can’t have kids but it keeps echoing in my head. 

Should I just leave? My family lives a state away. How do people even start to leave when they live together?  Should I not be considering telling everyone? Because I am. But I don’t know if that is too vindictive?

I can feel the spiral starting and I’m not sure I needed to just type this, or yell. I don’t know if I’m furious or hurt or humiliated or sad at this point. I just feel like I should be reacting somehow, but I’m just frozen.

Also we are in the late stages of adoption paperwork (which I have been the one heading the process) and I don’t really know what to do. I just feel like I was hit with a truck… and I feel like I gave so much to keep loving him, and I’ve just never felt so defeated and betrayed. Sorry again if this is unreadable.

So I took a step away and came back to a lot. Sorry I wasn’t responding. My brain was frozen before and now my mind is working about a trillion miles a minute now. I’m trying to read everything.

1:  since everyone who has asked has been polite, I thought I would address this again, and I understand that him causing my infertility sounds like a fun mystery or something. It’s not. So I would appreciate people not guessing or making anymore assumptions please. 

2: this is going to sound selfish… but I do think separating will get in the way of the adoption. And now that I am trying to imagine us a separate entities in this, I am accurately aware that it would get in the way of *me* having children …but not him. He is not sterile. The only thing him cheating, and me breaking it off will do is fuck up my life and my family future. And I just…I honestly don’t even know what to think about that. I’ve been heading the majority of paper work, I’ve been preparing the nursery, and schedules etc... I never really considered that I wouldn’t be able to love and raise children because of my infertility, but being a single woman makes adoption so much harder, even though I would be able to be financially stable on my own. 

3: I have called my mom, and I do intend to tell her. She is in a different time zone so we’ll talk when she’s off work.

4: I’ll probably keep reading any more advice until I call with my mom, but I can’t promise I’ll respond to everything.


+ 


I’m getting on the call with my mom, thank you everyone for helping me sort out my thoughts, sorry I didn’t respond much. I appreciate every one for being so kind, helpful, and respectful (I mean that).


+ 


This will likely be the last comment for a while. But I will be leaving my husband. I told my mother and my best friend last night everything. They will be helping my figure out when, how, and where is best for filing. I don’t know when I will file…But I will be staying with my best for now while I get my bearings, and until I’ve made a plan.  No, I have not alerted my husband to the fact that I know he cheated. And no I will not, until I decide when that is best.
I had to talk my mother and best friend down, and honestly I felt amazing have two people so angry on my behalf. I’m so glad I have them in my life. 

Thanks everyone.


+


One more issue to address. Maybe I am sensitive right not but I would appreciate if people stopped saying I need to find someone else, or I will. I had considered adoption prior to loosing my fertility or meeting my husband. As I stated in my post. So I don’t appreciate people suggesting I *need* to find another man to adopt with, when I have been working hard to be independently financially stable since I was 16, and am more than capable of raising a child on my own. The idea that me possibly being single in the near future will make adopting so much harder on paper is already hurting enough.


+


Okay, I think this will be my last update for a while. I know I said that already but I have a lot of appreciation for the people that encourage me to tell my friend. She has suggested we look into legal action against my husband for his the incident that caused my infertility. She is going to help me in looking into the best way to go about this. Along with the best way to approach continuing this adoption, if possible. 

Honestly, it’s so weird how much relief I feel right now, when yesterday was just a gut punch of nonsensical emotions. I’m oddly calm and collected. And my friend is also looking into setting me up with a reference from her therapist to find a new one for me.

Thanks again you everyone. Im doing okay.",1697147499.0,throwragoldearings,relationship_advice
I (20F) discovered something about my friend (46M) that grossed me out. What should I do?,"TLDR at bottom

I, (20F), recently met C (46M) and T (45M) on a trail while I was out mountain biking. C made some comment about me and my bike that started a conversation. It was pretty clear they were very experienced mountain bikers because they had really expensive bikes and gear. Now, my bike is a piece of shit because I'm a broke college kid. So, I thought it would be funny to show them my crappy gears, brakes, and bald tires. C seemed concerned, and he basically said I was going to end up hurting myself if I didn't get new tires, which was true. He offered to give me some spare tires he had sitting around and gave me his phone number. He also offered to take me riding sometime with him and T. Apparently, C and T take inexperienced mountain bikers (men and women of all ages) out all the time because they like getting new people into the hobby. 

He seemed really nice and like he genuinely cared about my safety, so I took his phone number. We made arrangements and I picked up the tires from him, and everything went great! We made plans to go riding the next weekend. C said I could ride one of his high-end full suspension bikes for the day, which I was super excited about.

At first, things were kind of awkward. C was clearly a little scared of weirding me out as an older man hanging out with a 20 year old woman, but he was super cool. He almost immediately said that if he ever did anything that made me uncomfortable to please let him know. Once we started talking about bikes and our various interests, we both started to have a super fun time. I also found out he's super into RC cars, and he's building a go-kart from scratch with T. I thought this was all fucking awesome.

C made it clear to me that he saw me as a kid and was going to treat me like I was his daughter. He said he wanted to be clear that he didn't want anything romantic, and he just wanted a friend and mountain biking buddy. He expressed that he thinks older men who try to get with younger women are super creepy. I agreed and was very relieved.

We had an awesome day. I had so much fun. He gave me lots of good pointers and was very, very encouraging. Whenever I hit a jump on did something cool, he would be cheering behind me. After we went on that ride, he took me to a taco place and paid for my lunch. Again, I'm a broke college kid, so that was awesome.

Since then, while driving to go riding together, me and C have had lots of good conversations. We've talked about random life topics like having anxiety, depression, what it's like working in construction, and how shitty our parents are. We also have text conversations about mountain biking or random stuff now and then.

I also have a very anxious attachment style and again, my dad was pretty shitty when I was growing up. He coached me in sports and was an absolute nutjob about it, often berating me if I didn't meet his standards. So, when C takes me out, gives me pointers, and tells me I'm doing a good job, it's felt very nice and healing. Something I love about C is that he likes to talk about deep topics and is very understanding of emotions, concerns, etc. This is very unlike my dad. For all these reasons, I've grown quite attached to him and he's become a father figure to me. He's also accidentally referred to me as his daughter before, which I first found surprising and endearing. 

In addition to mountain biking tips and tricks, he's given me lots of his old protective gear that he's grown out of or gotten new versions of. This has helped me get a lot more into the sport and I've been able to keep myself a lot safer.

At some point on one of our latest rides, he said something about how he had only been able to talk to me on the trail because he basically saw me as a kid. He said he has a hard time talking to women he likes (from social anxiety, like me) and if I was a woman in her 30s he would have just frozen up and not said anything.

I found this comment a little odd. 

That, and a few other remarks that he made that sort of rubbed me the wrong way, made me decide to look into him a little more. We follow each other on Instagram, so I decided to look at who he's following. 

He's following a bunch of OnlyFans models, including some concerningly young ones. Like a 19 year old. And a 22 year old, a 24 year old a ton right around there. It just got worse the more I looked. My stomach just dropped, and I've been feeling shitty all day now.

He's told me so many times that he thinks it's gross for older men to like young women. How he thinks of me like a child. That he would never like anyone romantically/sexually who is my age.

This is also a very sore spot for me because I also found out a few months ago that my dad (50M) has a crush on a 17 year old girl that I knew from high school. I found that disgusting and couldn't stop thinking about it for so long. It feels like the same thing all over again, and it hurts a lot.

I also got groomed online from the ages of 12-14 by men who were much older than me. So, I know how nice men can seem while being truly disgusting on the inside. 

But also, I don't think he's attracted to me like that. I don't really look like the pornstars and OnlyFans models he follows. And he truly is so fun to be around, and I'm always smiling and laughing when I go on rides with him and T. 

Should I keep hanging out with him? Should I be concerned? Someone please give me some advice. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I'm realizing a lot of other red flags after reading these comments. I think I'm going to cut off contact with him. Thank you, everyone, for the help, personal experiences, advice, etc. I really, really needed it.

UPDATE: I've gotten in contact with T's wife to ask her her opinion of C given our friendship. I'm currently waiting for her response. I've met her before and she seems nice, and I trust her opinion as a woman. I've pretty much made my decision already, but I want some assurance I'm doing to the right thing, because this is really, really hard.

UPDATE 2: I talked to T and his wife about the whole thing and made an update post with screenshots of our text messages. It's in my profile right after this one.

UPDATE 3: I sent C a long, mature text explaining why I'm cutting him off and how he made me really uncomfortable by telling me he sees me like a daughter and would never be into someone my age, and showing me the opposite. His response? ""Ok, whatever makes you comfortable"" What a prick. I almost expected an apology for making me feel this shitty and anxious or just something. But I think that shows he never actually cared about if I was uncomfortable, and if I had ever actually told him I was, he was just going to try to make it seem like my fault for not being able to handle it.

There were lots of red flags in his behavior beyond the porn thing. He made a lot of weird comments and jokes that made me uncomfortable, too.

He said he was like my sugar daddy with the gear he's given me and the food he's bought me. He talked about going far away places to ride and spending the night just the two of us in his camper. He said that I was the reason he would come back on the weekends when he was going to have to live out of a hotel for work 5 hours away. He would talk about things he would say to me ""if I was his girlfriend."" 

He keeps saying that I need all this protective equipment so I don't get all banged up and my parents start to think he's hurting me. As he was saying this, he kept saying stuff like ""your parents would be mad at me for hurting their precious baby"", ""their precious little girl"", etc., indirectly referring to me as those things.

Keep in mind that this was all after knowing him for a month. 

His friend T, who I met on the trail, also ended up telling me that he and his wife both thought C's behavior toward me and how much he was talking to me was super weird.

I naively believed him when he said he couldn't possibly be attracted to girls my age (said MANY times), and that's my fault. But the OnlyFans thing was only what made me realize that, duh, yeah, he could be attracted to me. And then I was like, oh fuck, everything he said seems super weird now that i think about it more.



TLDR: I 20F have a 46M friend who I go mountain biking with. He's always made it clear he sees me as a kid and would never be attracted to anyone my age. He says im like his daughter, and he's somewhat of a father figure to me. I recently found that he follows many OnlyFans models that are my age, and I'm very grossed out.

I (37F) suspect infidelity because I found condoms. Husband (38M) and I have not used condoms in years. What do I do next?,"UPDATE 06 Aug 2024
TLDR I found a ereceipt for the rubbers. They are his, no other *obvious* signs of infidelity 

Hello all
Sorry it’s a long one

It’s been a little while. RIP my inbox, I read so many comments and messages; many or most of them were helpful. I was so shocked and frightened that I just could not think calmly or what to do next, all of you helped me, you really did and I am thankful.

Last week I had probably one of the most horrendous days of my life. Let me try to explain a bit more clearly what happened and what’s happening. I won’t give exact details to preserve anonymity.

I was away from my husband 38M and 3 kids for almost 6 months. This was because I had to go with my sister to help our mum. She had a severe stroke and was not expected to make it, my sister was in pieces (she still spoke with mum even though I didn’t). Husband encouraged me to stay, he helped pay for ticket.

Originally I was only supposed to stay there to pretty much help bury her and then come back after a few weeks. However she’s surprised us all by staying alive and recovering somewhat, anyway there were still complications with her recovery physically mentally financially and I could not leave. I did not want to go in the first place, I did not want to stay and I sure as shit didn’t want to deal with her. I had not spoken or seen my mother in about 17 years because of her addiction issues. I never thought I’d ever see her again and I had massive emotional trauma to deal with.
But you know what? I’m glad I went. I faced my demons and showed compassion I did not know I was capable of, whilst I shall never be buddy buddy with mum, it has done good for my psychological/mental health.

And I realise now… my mental health has been shit. For years. Even before the kids were born. My husband tried to help but I was stuck fast wallowing in a depressed funk, I blamed my mum for my poor mental health and let myself go (physically and mentally).

For years I’d been sinking further and further down and yes it affected my relationships particularly with my husband.

My husband is a hard working insightful generous man. He has always supported me, never laid a finger on me and I feel safe around him. He is and always has been an excellent father. He has his faults, don’t we all?  But I love him and I know he loves me.

When I came back from my journey of rediscovery, my husband was expecting ‘the old me’. The depressed miserable bitchy moany not-sexy pessimistic me. I admit it to myself and it’s a hard pill to swallow - I think back at how I treated myself and my husband, the awful negative thoughts I had and I am ashamed.

Needless to say in all these years our physical/sex life was in the pits. Our marriage was crap. I admit it and I’ve cried all the tears I’ve had crammed up these past 17 years since I locked my hurt and pain away with my mother’s abandonment and abuse. 

I lost weight on my trip (almost 15kgs!) I’m off my antidepressants and eating healthy (without even trying!) In the past few months I’m actually interested in the day and what it brings, I’m present for my children and I feel like I’m in control.

However, when I came back I had to not exactly grovel, but a big apology/explanation was owed and it was hard to get the words out but I said them and I meant them.

I was unpacking drawers and I found condoms. I have an IUD and we haven’t used rubbers in years and years. The expiry date on these condoms was 2027 so not a chance they were old. I am a bit shamed to say I did discreetly search his email/messges and found the receipt for them in Amazon, he did buy them about 1 month ago. Only one is missing and I noticed the toys had been moved so I am certain that he used it on himself. I did search for other suspicious items etc but there were none.
I did check messages and there is nothing suspicious. Nothing at all. My husband hasn’t been behaving suspicious and I think when I confronted him with the condoms I found he just blurted out a bs excuse and because of the distance between us he wouldn’t admit using them on himself (yet).

I also had a look at our finances and I am ashamed to see how hard my husband has been working to keep a roof over our heads. Nothing suspicious going on and we are lucky to have him so committed. I have sadly heard in other comments about how some people just dump the partner with kids when it gets too tough.

The fear I felt in that moment, that yes, he was cheating, was overwhelmingly real. I can see how my refusal to get help, not be physical and always a moany cow could push him away. I don’t see him starting another relationship, but I could see him maybe using a service. Maybe? I dunno.

So Will I throw away 15+ good years (mostly) away for this? No. I am going to do the best I can because these past years have been pretty fucking awful and he has been working so damn hard and I have just been… consumed with self loathing. I know I know I can’t take the blame for absolutely everything that’s gone wrong. However I’m starting with what I can. I have for the first time in a looooong time felt actually excited about what I can do with the future.

BUT I will definitely 100% be getting a job to make myself self sufficient. Cheating/divorce isn’t the only way a partner can leave you and this whole event has shown me a warning shot that I need to get a grip and find a job. I have also started some online courses to brush up on skills I haven’t used in years. I’ve updated my cv again (using AI software what a trip!) and I in fact already have an interview set up 2 weeks from now.

AND I will also discreetly consult a lawyer/citizens advice bureau to find out the ‘what if’ we get divorced because knowledge definitely is power.

And I must explain that I didn’t cry my eyes out and terrify the children like some comments suggested. There is no trauma, they’re fine and I’ve gotten a hold of myself. I cried once or twice coming out the bathroom and then went for a long ass walk to cry and try get hold of myself.

So… one condom missing from a box seems to be the catalyst for my life. Made me look at what is actually of value.

Whatever happens, I know I’ll be fine. I realise now how difficult things have been for my husband and how I wasn’t helping at all. The shame still makes me cry and I am hoping that’s a good thing actually, because I year ago I wouldn’t have given a shit, just would have done some more self-destructive behaviour probably. 

Thank you all for your comments. Really. I really mean it, a lot of them helped me shake some sense into me and allow for self-reflection.

It is early days yet, but I am hopeful. My husband was smiling at me across the room the other day after I had done something for him and it’s the first time in ages I saw that. He said something flirty and I felt butterflies. Not disgust and contempt like a year or two ago.

Anyway. I have rambled a lot and I’m not going to edit this. Maybe I’ll update again, maybe I won’t. But yes again thanks so much for your help.

Married 15 yrs have had an ok marriage, went a bit pear shaped after having 3 kids in 4 years (9f 7F 5M).

"My girlfriend (18F) told me l'm (18M) ""really giving her a reason to cheat""-how should i respond?","My girlfriend (18F) recently told me that I (18M) am ""really giving her a reason to cheat,"" and I’m trying to understand what might have led to this statement and how I should proceed. We've been together for almost 4 years, and while our relationship is generally happy, there have been some ongoing issues that haven’t been fully resolved.

The context for her comment seems to be related to a recent discussion about a research contest. I'm part of a research group that my girlfriend is also in. I wanted us to compete in this contest because our advisers expect us to participate. However, most of the group, including my girlfriend, didn't want to join because they were anxious about completing a full research paper by the end of September. My girlfriend specifically told me, ""I'm not with you this time,"" which hurt because I’ve been feeling pressured after not winning a similar contest last year. I apologized for trying to push them, and after that, she made a post on her IG notes saying, ""suckup to other people."" When I apologized again, saying it was for being a ""suckup,"" she responded with, ""Thanks, you're really giving me a reason to cheat.""

This isn’t the first time she has mentioned something like this, but this time I feel more unsettled. Additionally, I've been focusing on my self-development lately, which might be causing some jealousy or tension between us. She usually encourages me when I feel down, telling me I'm skillful and not worthless, but now I'm confused about where we stand.

"Wife (F33) gave me (M35) an ultimatum that I can't fulfill, but it's hard to set a boundary. How do I best navigate this?","Throwaway because I fear that reddit-using friends will identify us.

So, we're together for 4 years, married for 2, and it's been rough for the past six months or so. Something about my spouse has changed - she started having really powerful and increasingly frequent emotional outbursts when something doesn't go her way, or her expectations are not met. During those she will drag me (and only me, she doesn't do that to others thankfully) down and treat me like the worst human being in the world, berating me and sometimes threatening divorce. That said, after an outburst is over, she will always apologize and outside of them she is a very supportive partner who I believe genuinely loves me and who accepts my expressions of love as well. To avoid running afoul of rule 4, I won't go into detail about her mental health, and the actual advice I want is about a more specific situation. The outbursts are just part of the context.

So, a couple of months ago I quit my job to start my own business in my field. This was something that I did after thoroughly discussing it with my wife and with her explicit encouragement. I articulated numerous times to her that the transition most likely would cause us some financial hardship for a period of six months to a year, and she always told me she would be fine with that and would also work to support us. Currently she is between jobs. Her taking up even a modest part-time job would be enough to keep us safely afloat.

Now, the same week I quit my corporate job she sat me down and told me that she wants to start trying to a baby. Like, now. When I pushed back on that and asked her to wait until my business is a little more off the ground, it led to a big fight and a divorce threat - or rather, for the first time in our relationship, a divorce ultimatum: start trying now or we're done. After she calmed down, she agreed to wait a month, which frankly is nowhere near sufficient but it is what it is. When I asked her what we're going to do if the child is born before we're financially secure, her response was that she'll get jobs, I'll get more jobs, her family will help with childcare, and we'll pull through. Not easy, but okay, if we both work, if we both commit to it, it's doable.

The transition to running my own outfit started better than I expected and I was able to make a slightly bigger chunk of money at the start than we planned for. Still, this doesn't change the fact that I need my wife's financial support during this stage. And yet, just a few days ago, during another outburst caused by an unrelated issue she suddenly told me that she doesn't feel secure with me anymore, doesn't believe I can succeed independently, and (and that part was the real kick in the stomach) doesn't want to balance childcare with work and so wants to be a SAHM for the first 2-3 years of our child's life. And finally, she gave another ultimatum - secure a ""sufficient"" (she declined to name a sum) income by the end of next year, or we're done, regardless of whether we're parents by then or not. After she came back to her senses she did apologize and claimed she ""didn't mean"" what she said, but I haven't quite had the courage to ask if that includes the divorce ultimatum and the SAHM part. Realistically, given the conditions she has set, I would need to be making enough by next year to provide for a SAHM wife and an infant. I'm not sure I can meet that within that timeframe - which is exactly why I wanted to wait before trying for a baby.

Now, normally ultimatums like the ones she gave me would be where I would set a hard boundary. To her last one I would say ""Honey, I would love to provide that lifestyle for you, and I plan to eventually, but getting there in one year is not something I can honestly promise. More likely than not I won't achieve that so soon. If that's a deal breaker for you, if waiting longer and/or working yourself is totally unacceptable to you now, then we might need to start thinking of separation"" As much as it would break my heart to even talk of separating, let alone actually going through with that, I believe in the importance of setting and maintaining boundaries to have a healthy relationship, and also in good old honesty and not making promises I'm not sure I can keep.  
The problem is, I'm an immigrant and depend on my wife for my residence status here (not the US). In fact, until I can secure permanent residence, which is a couple of years away, my ability to even run the business hinges on maintaining my spousal visa here. So if I set that boundary and she decides to separate, that's it, I'll be finished. My best hope would be to try to quickly get a job that can sponsor residency for me, but that's *extremely* unlikely to happen and realistically I would probably have to go back to my country of birth where none of my skill sets could land me a job and where, due to international sanctions, I wouldn't even be able to transfer any of my savings or even just carry them back as cash. I'd be destitute.  
My wife doesn't know how much I depend on her. She understands that the spousal visa affords me more freedom but doesn't quite realize how bad the consequences for me would be if I were to move back. Initially I didn't want to tell her that because I didn't want it weighing on her in case she ever considered divorcing me, and now that she's been having those emotional outbursts I'm also wary that if I told her, she might impulsively use that knowledge to do something we both might badly regret later.  
Now, many will probably ask why I chose to become so dependent on my wife. Before that, I was relying on employers to sponsor my residence in this country and going from that to my spouse, someone I was marrying because I saw her as a kind and supportive partner and the love of my life, felt like an upgrade. I trusted her more than any of my employers and generally still do. I just didn't expect that she would ever make such demands on threat of divorce. If there were any red flags I sure as hell missed them.
As it stands, it's been a few days and things between us are back to normal except obviously her ultimatum still weighs on me. So far I just can't find the courage to talk about it with her.

I'm already talking with a legal professional about my options in case she does decide to end the marriage, but my question to the sub is - how do I best navigate this going forward, if my ideal goal is to save our marriage and relationship?  So far my plan is to just sort of hope for the best and keep the current course. I understand that the outcome is not up to me only, but I'd like some outside opinions on how best to move forward - perhaps tell me what you would do in such a situation?

"Wife (36F) wanted open marriage, after I (38M) started dating she wants to add more rules. What would you do in my position?","Two and a half years ago my wife ""Sarah"" (36F) asked me to open our marriage, she strongly implied the alternative was divorce. After thinking it through I said yes, primarily because we do have two children, I worked long hours and divorce sounded horrible.

So I set up some ground rules. Not bringing dates into our house, no dating mutual friends, acquaintances, family members, collages, keeping things private. 

For the next two years I focused on my job and on my kids. I worked long hours, little free time I had I devoted to my kids. I didn't had the time for dating so I wasn't even trying. I moved to another room because the thought of Sarah having sex with another man, then sleeping in my bed felt horrible, our relationship became purely transactional, we became partners at raising kids. I didn't want to know anything about her sex life.

This summer I managed to fulfill my financial goals. I do not have any debt whatsoever, both of my kids have enough money in their college fund, and all I have to do is to keep adding some savings every month into the fund I made for their first home deposits. So I did some math and decided to cut my work from 74 hours to just 30 per week. Sarah wanted to get indebted again to buy another house and a new car, I said no.

I used my free time to finally have a vacation I really needed, took older son with me to tour US together. Did some renovation work on our house, turned basement into man cave. Started working out play sports, leading a healthier life.

Then I actually started trying to land a date. For me just having sex with somebody is... not my thing. I want to atleast be a friend before that. To go out together, watch movies, have fun AND have sex. So I dated a couple of women and found a ""Jane"" with whom I clicked.

With Jane I was going out to concerts, art galleries, comic cons, movies... AND we would ""boink"" too.

Sarah wanted to talk about my dates. I said no. Then I caught Sarah snooping through my phone and we had a very strongly worded argument.

Now Sarah want's to update the terms of our open marriage. She want's us repair our marriage by going to the counselor, she want's us to sleep in the same room, to go outside and have fun together.

Our outside of marriage relationships are to be strictly sexual and nothing else. And we are to talk about our sexual partners.

I told her that I am content with the situation as it is, and I don't mind if she finds a partner to go out with. I encouraged her to. And i **don't want** to talk about our partners.

She is holding her ground.

At this point I'm split between trying to fix our marriage and handing her the divorce papers. I need an advice guys.

I [F45] lost one eye. Boyfriend [M57] of 5 years just told me he no longer finds me desirable,"My partner/boyfriend (M, 57) of 5 years just told me (F, 40s) he no longer finds me attractive since my brain surgery that caused me to lose one eye. So he has gotten a mistress in her 20s for sex. 

I have an eyepatch now and probably will for the rest of my life. But really?!!!! 

I’m not even sure what to do with this.

I’m still recovering so can’t quite leave yet (we live together). But I’m just in shock.

Besides the 10 pounds I gained and the eye patch. I look the same as I did when we started dating.

I’m a former model but I wasn’t when we met. I did my best to find a man that I thought wasn’t with me solely for my looks (cause I knew one day they would go). 

The irony is I stood with  him through chemo. He lost his hair and then he gained 25 pounds and I still made sure he felt desirable. And managed his business while he was sick. 

Im mad at myself for letting this put me in a deep depression. My surgery was a two months ago.Strangers still compliment me on my looks.. I graciously say thank you and move on. So I still believe at least one man will still find me attractive with an eyepatch.

But I just feel awful cause this one person who Ive shared my life with looks at me with disgust. So I cry and then I get mad at myself for crying.

I keep thinking he is crazy but that doesn’t stop the tears. 

So I guess I’m just asking for encouragement from people who are on the other side of leaving an unappreciative partner and now with a good one. And really any encouragement.

I know I’ll get to the other side. But right now this stinks.

EDIT: Wow! To wake up to such support has literally brought me to tears. I’m just overwhelmed with the encouraging words. To know that so many people would take a moment to encourage me will help me greatly as I continue to heal my body and begin my solo chapter. I may not be able to respond to each comment (I have to rest my good eye), but I appreciate every one! Thank you so much!",1691377222.0,Purple-Apple-234,relationship_advice
"I (25F) want a divorce from 25M, do I have grounds or am I being a baby?","I (25F) and my husband (25M) have been married for just short of 4 years. In that time we have had two children and learned that he has ADHD. He worships the ground I walk on, he would feed me grapes and serve my gold on a silver platter if I asked. BUT he won't do a single chore around the house, can't maintain a train of thought long enough to clean up after himself, refuses to regularly take his meds, won't go to work (he works from home) despite me expressing concern on many occasions that he's going to lose his job. I'm a SAHM so that thought is extra terrifying. We recently purchased a property that turned into a whole flip instead a few minor upgrades we thought we were going to have to do. He never goes to work on it so we're stuck staying at my dad's. His response is that he ""just loves me so much and wants to spend all his time with me"". I am constantly encouraging him to leave and go do his responsibilities because they need done but truthfully, I feel smothered. I have to remind him to put lotion and medicine on his skin (horrible eczema, probably psoriasis), I have to remind him to shower. So all in all the only things I can guarantee that he will do is pay the bills (that are all on auto pay) and take out the trash (but not run it to the landfill). All of this has been wearing on me for four years, I actually quit my job 3 years ago because we were going to get a divorce if I didn't because he expected me to manage everything in the house and work full time as an ICU nurse because that's what his mom did. So all of this obviously sucks and I feel like I'm living with an stubborn overgrown toddler who can't make a decision to save his life but argues with me when I try to make one, BUT on top of all of that he recently had the fourth person in his life (over the span of our relationship) come to him to ask if I was taking advantage of him and if I ""understood"" that he needed to work... yall. I just about exploded. I feel like I'm going crazy because I know I'm dragging him through life and he's barely hitting the bare minimum, but apparently he's presenting me in a negative light to those around him. And when I ask how he presents me he says ""fairly"". I feel like I'm going crazy and I have been begging for therapy, but after another person asked if I was taking advantage I feel like I'm just done. What am I even fighting for at this point? To drag a man child around just to be viewed as the bad guy from the outside? The only reason I'm still here is because of the kids but I don't know if that's better either. I don't know. Send help.

TLDR: married to an overgrown man child with adhd that won't take his meds and presents me as the bad guy to everyone in his life.

Editing to add some clarity: 

1. he is a wonderful father. I couldn't have picked a better dad for my children (minus some forgetfulness). He loves them fully and takes amazing care of them, never acts like a babysitter, etc.

2. He works from home. When I say he won't go to work, I mean he won't go to his office upstairs and start working. It's regular for him to have a 3-4 hour work day.

3. I'd be thrilled if he just worked and cleaned up after himself. I don't need him to split chores or anything like that. Obviously help is a plus, but working a job and working on fixing up a house is an incredible weight to carry... if he'd go and do those things. 

4. Also yes I was a little sassy, I wrote my fully transparent feelings on a throw away account for a reason, I'd never speak to him or anyone we knew about him like this.

My (38M) SAHW (40F) has been treating our Son (12M) poorly and favoring our Daughter (9F) ever since I complimented his cooking. How should I handle this?,"My wife has always been the one to cook around the house, and as an Italian, it's one of the reasons I fell so hard for her. I've offered to help out in the kitchen or even cook for her sometimes, but she's always firmly, yet politely, told me no and I can't really blame her because I did NOT get either of my parents' good cooking genes. Because of this I've always been sure to thank her for every meal and I've taught my children to do the same.

For the past year or so my son has been watching a ton of cooking videos on youtube and tiktok and he's really been wanting to try his hand at cooking. My wife was happy to teach him and at least twice a week the two of them will go out to the store, buy ingredients for a meal he found on tiktok and come home and make it. It's been awesome seeing them bonding more, since they haven't really had much overlap in interests before this.

About a month ago after dinner, my son asked his mom if he could try making us all a meal on his own. I said it sounded like a great idea, and she hemmed and hawed for a little while before agreeing. So that Saturday she took him to the store to get his ingredients and then he got to work. She supervised here and there, but he insisted that she didn't need to so eventually she came to the living room and sat with my daughter and I looking a little bit dejected, so I reassured her that I was sure he'll still wanna cook with her, he just wanted to try it out on his own. That seemed to help out a little but she still seemed a little off. 

When he finished and we all sat down to eat, I was honestly surprised at just how good he managed to do on his own. I feel bad saying it but even after a year or so of cooking with his mother, I expected him to mess up more than he did. I wanted to encourage this interest of his so I was sure to let him know while I was eating how good he did, and gently bring up the few mistakes he had made. I did it a lot more than I usually would with my wife's cooking, and in hindsight I can see that that's what started all of this.

His sister, being his little sister, was not as supportive as I was, and quite rudely insulted his cooking. I was going to tell her to mind her manners and be thankful that he cooked for us when my wife made a sound and pushed her plate away, before agreeing and saying that it was too salty and overcooked. This took me aback, and I could tell my son took it hard too, as his mood visibly dropped. I didn't say anything at the time, since my wife and I never argue in front of the kids, and I just kept up the praise of my son's cooking as his mother picked at the plate for a little while longer before she took her and our daughter's plates to the kitchen.

A little while later, I had went to check on my son, and I could tell that he had been crying, so I comforted him, told him I was sure his mother loved the food and that she was probably just having a bad day, not to take it personally. Then later, once the kids were asleep, I confronted her about it, and she tried to just brush it off, but I pushed and she got mad and said that I complimented his cooking far more than I ever complimented hers. This caught me off guard, since I didn't expect my wife to be jealous of our son, and I unfortunately let out an involuntary scoff at this. She blew up at me for laughing, and we ended up arguing for a while before eventually I managed to explain that I was complimenting him so much because I wanted to encourage him to keep cooking, and she even admitted that she shouldn't have been so harsh about it. She said she would apologize to him and I figured that everything was settled.

That Monday, when I was driving my son to school, I noticed he wasn't acting normal, and looking out the window, trying to hide his face from me. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me he was fine, but I could tell he was fighting back tears so I asked him again and he broke and told me that after I had left to get the car started, she told him that she was going to be cooking alone again from now on. I was furious about this, but kept my cool and told him I would talk to her about it, bought him a snack from the store before dropping him off at school.

I left work early so I could get home before the kids and talk to my wife. I'll admit I didn't handle it as well as I could have and we ended up in a shouting match where I was calling her childish for being so vindictive towards our son because she was upset with me, and she called him a baby and said he shouldn't be so sad about not being allowed to cook since it wasn't a man's job to do so anyway. We ended up leaving each other alone to cool down, and when our kids got home, my wife took our daughter out, and came back later with a load of toys and clothes for her. 

I knew immediately what she was trying to do, and that night I told her that I would not let her use the money I make for our family to punish my son. She didn't take this well and we ended up arguing again. I slept in the guestroom, and have been up to this point. For this past month my wife has kept up this vindictive showering of our daughter with attention and gifts, while almost entirely ignoring my son. I've been talking to my parents and brother about this, and while they agree that she's wrong, they also don't see it as that big of a problem and think it'll sort itself out. At this point, with how she's been treating our son, I'm starting to fall out of love with her, but I also don't want to just jump to divorce if there's something that I can do to fix this whole situation. 

I can honestly say that we've never had a fight this big. Sure, we bicker every now and then, but she's never taken that out on my son in the past. I feel responsible and guilty about what happened, and I've been trying to do nice things for my son, when I can, but I also don't want to mirror my wife's behavior so I've also been taking my daughter with us about half the time we go places, but whenever we do, she's been very rude and always talks about all the stuff her mother does for her lately, because she knows it bothers her brother. 

Seeing the way my wife has been treating our son has made me second guess our marriage, but I don't want to just jump straight to divorce either. Any advice on what I should do, or how to best bring up the topic of therapy would be appreciated.",1712603951.0,Tough_Measurement345,relationship_advice
I (25F) finally broke up with my boyfriend (24M) after he made a comment about my weight several months ago. Now he wants to try again—what should I do?,"For context, my ex and I were together for a little under two years. About halfway through the relationship, he expressed dissatisfaction with condoms, citing that they were uncomfortable and affected his ability to perform.

I’d had a bad experience with the pill in the past, so I was hesitant to get on birth control right away. However, he heavily encouraged me to find something, reiterating his issues with condoms. At the time, I was so in love with him that I just wanted to make him happy. I thought this would bring us closer together, as he often complained about how condoms made things feel less intimate.

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not researching different forms of birth control and immediately scheduled an appointment to get the prescription.

The next few months were awful. I experienced mood swings, depression, suicidal ideations, and gained 25 pounds. These side effects were miserable, but he was a great support through all of it—until we got into a minor fight.

In a bout of anger, he said he liked me better when I was skinnier and found my new body less attractive.

Before this, I had never felt ashamed of my physique. Even after gaining the weight, I still loved my body. I adored my curves and found beauty in how it was soft and plush, even though it was different from my formally athletic build. But his comment shattered me. 

In the days following, I couldn’t look at myself without thinking how the person who claimed to love me thought I wasn’t good enough.

He immediately apologized after making the comment. I tried to work things out with him, and I began counseling, dieting, and a new exercise regime, but I remained heavily insecure.

Our relationship dynamic shifted. I started denying intimacy with him and putting distance between us. He quickly noticed and berated me for “punishing him” for something that happened in the past. He acted as if he was entitled to sex and that my denying him was a form of spite, when in reality, I couldn’t see myself as attractive and never felt up for doing anything.

We made a genuine effort to salvage what was left of the relationship. He claimed that he still found me beautiful, but my lack of progress in shedding the weight and his lack of sympathy caused an even bigger rift until I eventually broke it off.

Recently, he has been messaging me about how he still loves me and that there are so many things we have left to do together. I think I still love him, and my heart breaks for what we lost, but I don’t know if I can ever get over what he said. It feels so small and silly, and I want to be with him, but I can’t forget his words. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.

How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi97h9/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a_friend_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey guys! Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a ""story"". But I understand, haha.

I just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.

I also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like ""she's cheating, it's over"" and ""don't even confront her, just leave"". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work. 

And thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.

**ON TO THE UPDATE.**

I decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest. 

I basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?

She immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy). 

So, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN! 

Needless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha.

"I (39F) heard something my husband (45M) said on a phone call, and it shook me. How do I talk to him about it?","I (39F) have been married to my (45M) husband for eight years now. He has a friend, ‘Brian’ (40M), who worked with my husband at his old job. Brian has a wife, ‘Helen’ (39F), and young daughter (4F). Brian and my husband used to be close friends and drinking buddies, but they haven’t hung out in person for several years. My husband has told me in the past that he no longer wants to talk to Brian because he’s a negative person, but they still text and call each other sometimes.

Last week I heard my husband on the front porch talking on the phone. I thought he sounded different, so I put my ear against the front door to listen (I know, I know). Basically, I pieced together that Brian cheats, or tries to cheat, on his wife when he goes out drinking, and my husband encourages it.

They were joking about Brian’s friends switching partners and having a threesome, which I thought was weird and out of character. Then I heard my husband say, “So, you went to the bar. Did you get any action?” like it was a normal question he asked all the time. They also mocked Helen for “calling Brian 50 times” to check up on him while he was out and joked about her installing a GPS tracker on Brian’s phone. My husband said that Brian used to be careful with his phone because he “didn’t want Helen to see the texts between (Brian) and (my husband).”

Guys, my husband sounded like a totally different person. My stomach dropped as I heard everything. I’m still in shock. I never thought my husband would condone cheating, but to also be so calm and almost gleeful about it? I’m feeling hugely disillusioned. And I’m thinking about all the times Brian and my husband used to go out to the bars years ago, and was this or something worse happening then? My thoughts have been spiraling, and I’m walking around in a daze.

My husband doesn’t know what I heard, but I feel like everything has changed. I know I need to talk to him, but I don’t know how. I’ve never been good with confrontation or speaking when I’m emotional. How do I handle this conversation?

TL;DR – I overheard my husband on the phone encouraging his friend's cheating and bad behavior, and now I'm spiraling and don't know how to talk to him about the breach of trust.

How should I (M45) deal with a wife (F47) who would prefer working for minimum wage instead of using her law degree?,"Important background: My wife has chronic fatigue syndrome. She worked full-time for a few years after we got married; she is an attorney and was earning \~$75K/year.  In 2010, however, her illness became too much to manage while also holding down a job and for the next nine years I was the sole breadwinner for our family. We have paid roughly $500 each year for her to maintain her law license even though she has not been using it. This has been an incredible strain, particularly once we added a couple of kids, but during that time I NEVER pushed her to go back to work because I understood that it might just be too much for her to deal with. But four years ago a mutual friend of ours asked my wife to occasionally spend a few hours per week helping out in a clerical role for minimum wage and she agreed. This gradually turned into my wife working 15-20 hours a week, and occasionally working as much as 35 hours in a week.  She would come home utterly exhausted and would sleep through most of the following weekends.

After a few months of this, I pointed out to her that if she can physically manage regularly working in an office for that amount of time, perhaps she should consider doing (MUCH more lucrative) legal work instead.  I noted that she could work from home (no need to get dressed up or deal with a commute), and that if she billed just FIVE hours per week - one hour per weekday - she could roughly double our household income. Even so, I only offered this as a consideration - I did not insist. Several opportunities have presented themselves over the past few years for her to resume work as a lawyer; although she sometimes expressed minimal interest, she did not actually pursue any of them.  When our friend asks, she continues to do the clerical work at minimum wage.

Last December, after a year of particularly acute financial stress, I finally put my foot down. I told my wife that the family NEEDED her to start earning more. A small wills & trusts practice would be a low-pressure approach that would give her all the scheduling flexibility she could possibly need.  I reiterated that I was only asking her to do work from home for five hours each week, and I offered to help her get started.  I also started setting deadlines by which I would ask for her to report progress toward the goal of starting a new law practice.  Over the first six months of this year I know she has (grudgingly) made some effort to move in this direction, but still does not seem inclined to actually start doing the legal work.

I have about reached my wits' end. I love my wife and divorce is absolutely not an option, but I am starting to really resent her unwillingness to take the steps necessary to help carry the family's financial burden. I have used every gentle approach I can think of to tell her how important this is to me, but to little avail. A couple of weeks ago I was literally about ten minutes away from demanding that she find a marriage counselor for us to talk to (I was rehearsing in my head the exact way I wanted to approach it), but I ended up pulling back at the last minute because I do not think she would take that well and I also felt like that was one of those bridges that, once crossed, can never be uncrossed.  And so, Reddit, I am asking for advice. Should I tell her that we need to see a marriage counselor?  Should I take some other approach?

EDIT, to provide additional context:I am a public interest attorney focusing on civil rights/civil liberties with a non-profit that my wife and I founded together. Although I am able to take on amazing cases, our organization is much more non-profit than most.  We bring in an average of $45K-55K per year and we have two sets of student loans to pay off.  For the past decade we have lived in her parents' basement in a rural county and the amount I am able to bring in by myself is just barely enough to keep us afloat, with zero money being set aside for retirement. The twenty hours of work per \*month\* - not per week - I am asking her to do (which I would be willing to help with) would bring in an additional $15K-30K per year.  


SECOND EDIT:  


Thanks much to most of the people who have taken an interest in this post and have provided their insight.  I do appreciate it.  That said, I wanted to clarify a few more points that will address some of the assumptions built into a number of the comments.  


First point - Someone could drop a million dollars on our family tomorrow and we would not choose to live somewhere else. My in-laws are AMAZING people, which is how they produced the amazing woman that I love.  I feel that many commenters do not appreciate the fact that two people can love each other very much and be mostly very happy, but still have one particular, significant issue that creates tension or frustration.  You don't divorce someone you love and are very happy living with over one frustration, even if that frustration becomes quite significant.  You look for ways to fix the problem, which is why I wrote this post in the first place.  And for people who question having kids even though they're expensive... I suggest a little perspective. For the entirety of human history up until just a few decades ago, pretty much everyone alive was much, much poorer than my family is right now. I believe that children (especially \*our\* children) are a blessing and a gift. No amount of material wealth or comfort would be worth not having them.

Second point - Where I grew up, suggesting marital counseling would almost inevitably be seen as a prelude to asking for a divorce.  It is not something that anyone would take lightly.  I am considering this course of action because I recognize that there is an issue in our marriage that we really do need to address and because I am aware that the only ideas I have been able to come up with lately (other than counseling) are likely to be far more harmful for our relationship than they would be helpful.  Thus the question I presented: ""Should I tell her that we need to see a marriage counselor? Should I take some other approach?""  Also, although I see how harsh my phrasing sounds where I said I was near to ""demanding she find a marriage counselor for us,"" I feel that this is a matter of not expressing myself well. My wife is plugged into a large group of local moms, several of whom have pursued counseling related to their own marriages. In my mind, asking her to choose a marriage counselor would make sense (1) because she could get opinion from a number of people who have experience with this sort of counseling, and (2) because it would ensure that she could select someone \*she\* was comfortable with rather than someone I just scraped up.  I definitely phrased that element of the original comment poorly, and for that I apologize.

Third point - My wife's ability to work is something we have discussed together for several years. For about a decade, her working was absolutely out of the question. I never even suggested that she should work during that time, much less encouraged her to.  Over the past four years, however, her condition \*has\* improved. I did not mention it in the original post, but in addition to the minimum wage work she's done, she has also assumed leadership positions in a couple of different community groups.  She invests several hours a week into the planning and financial management of these groups, although none of it is paid.  I'm thrilled - seriously thrilled! - that she is now able to do these sorts of things because, as noted, for almost a solid decade there was absolutely no way she could have.  But now that it seems clear (to me at least) that she has the capacity for these additional things, both paid and unpaid, my hope has been that she would channel at least part of that capacity into more remunerative work. Again, if it was a question of her feeling \*unable\* to do what I've asked, I would not be asking it. Not at all. But over the past four years, she has never said that what I am asking is unreasonable or that she lacks the willingness or ability to do it... she just hasn't done it.

Final point - She and I established our non-profit because, although I know some will feel it foolhardy, we care deeply about representing people who would otherwise have \*no one\* willing or able to take their cases. That's the entire reason I got into law in the first place. Furthermore, in many ways our non-profit is our first child. I would only give up the work and the organization I love if it is an absolute last resort. And, to be clear, I would indeed do that if I felt like we just didn't have any other alternative. But as one commenter correctly noted, taking one of those lucrative jobs would mean not only abandoning the principles and the organization that we worked so hard to build and maintain, it would also almost certainly require us to move to a larger city which would take us away from the community and family members that we love.  And so I would hope that the marriage counseling route would allow us to figure out if my wife really is simply not \*able\* to do more remunerative work - in which case I would \*immediately\* abandon any expectation of her doing so - or whether for whatever reason she would simply prefer not to. If she \*can't\* do it, then I may indeed need to consider taking a big-money job and moving the family somewhere else.  But if it turns out that she is, in fact, capable of doing this sort of work but either (1) needs additional help to get the ball rolling, or (2) simply doesn't \*want\* to do this kind of work, that's precisely what I am hoping marriage counseling might help us discern and address.",1692029376.0,elusivemrx,relationship_advice
I (20M) fucked up. I checked her (23F) phone. Is this enough to end things?,"Update: I broke up with her. 

I (20M) went through her (23F) phone, I’m aware it’s wrong and a breach of trust but something in me made me feel like I needed to, maybe it’s insecurity or maybe I just couldn’t trust her.

I found from a couple of months back (we’ve been going out for a year), she was telling her friend that she wished she had had sex with one of the men from her past, saying she “needs him”. She also said that he was on her “bench” and her friend was encouraging her to post golfing photos (he’s a golfer) to “stay on his radar”. She also wanted her friend to “do research” on this man, incase her relationship with me failed.

I also found a lot of conversations with the same friends slagging off my family and my mum in particular, and many other instances where I discovered lies, or more-so omitted truths from previous situations that she had told me about. For example, photos of her and other guys on a night out - whom she had told me at the time that she didn’t run into. 

I don’t know if this is enough to break up. There have been no instances or evidence of cheating or actually physically messaging other men, but something about this situation now just makes me feel horrible. 

We otherwise have a happy and successful relationship. These comments and discoveries have come out of nowhere.

TLDR; I’ve proven why it’s a terrible idea to go through your partner’s phone.

Edit: Just to clarify: The golfer has made it very clear that he is interested in her. They had a long summer last year (before she was with me) of being close friends/ very casual dating where he explicitly said he wanted to be with her. She refused, and began to date me.

"My (25f) boyfriend’s (26m) family lost their home in a fire, and are asking me to put my name on a mortgage loan so they can buy a new house. I’d love to be helpful, but is that too much to ask?","Edit: this house would be in my name, on the deed. The cats are not “destroying my apartment” as so many people are assuming, just the couch. I obviously care about these people which is why i would even consider it, so please stop creating a story in your head where I’m some sucker wanting to be scammed 😅

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost 4 years, living together for about 2. I’ll cut to the chase: his family (mom, dad, and sister) suffered a house fire in January, and they stayed with us in our one-bedroom apartment for a couple weeks until their insurance got them a hotel. Now they are in the hotel. His family had 10 cats, and 9 of those cats are in the apartment with us currently. So it’s me, him, and 9 cats right now. They pay for the food and litter, but I’ve bought them a cat tower and some toys. They’ve basically destroyed my couch but I figured they would and it was a cheap couch.

This past Sunday (two days ago) they went to see a realtor to talk about buying a house. Where they lived was a place they rented for a decade, and the landlord was pissed about the fire so they don’t want to go back there even when the house is fixed. My boyfriend was supposed to be the one on the loan, because his parent aren’t citizens and would have to pay an out the a** on a down payment. But since he has a social security number, he can get a regular rate.

The problem is, he doesn’t make enough on his own. If I went in on him for the loan, our combined income would be enough to qualify. If I go in on the loan, we could stay with his family in the house, and save for our own home later. We’d have more space, which would be great because I’m trying to start a business, and I wouldn’t be living in the one-bedroom with 9 cats.

But it’s also a 30-year mortgage loan. He has told me that what ever I decide to do won’t affect our relationship, but I’m afraid this will for ME. If I don’t decide to go on the loan, his parents said they’ll get a trailer, and take the cats, but his sister (19) would still probably end up living with us because her job is close to us and she doesn’t drive. 

I feel like I’m losing it. I feel like no matter what I do, I’m losing something. I’m so conflicted. I’ve asked the advice of my mom and some friends, and they think they’re asking too much. But if I don’t go in on the house, I’m still in this apartment that costs too much and adding an extra person to our space.

So I’m asking, should I just let them put my name on the mortgage loan? Or should I accept that his sister will be living with us? I hate to add any more elements of stress to their lives because they’ve already been through so much, but now it’s leaking into my life. A LOT.

TLDR: my boyfriend’s family suffered a house fire and is asking me to go on the loan with him so they can get a house. If I don’t, they’ll get a trailer for themselves and their 10 cats, and his sister will live with us. Help me pick my poison?
 
Edit(?): so this got a lot of attention fast. I’d like to clear up that they aren’t pressuring me, but it’s obviously a tense situation for them because you know, it’s their housing in the line. They’re just kind of at the mercy of insurance paying for their hotel. It’s a desperate situation, and a desperate ask. 

I will talk to my boyfriend today about different options. I spoke to my mom, who is a homeowner, and she advised against this, but seeing all of your reasons as well, like not being able to get a second mortgage because of this one, is a nail in the coffin. I’ll suggest his sister stay with us as long as she is looking for another place of her own, and encourage her to maybe look to roommate with a good friend of hers maybe. 

I knew this would be a risky move but seeing how much it really takes from me, just no. I will update later, but have peace of mind that I will NOT be taking out a mortgage for his family.

My (39F) partner (40M) has trouble letting things go,"I (39F) am very much in love with my live-in BF(40M). We're 3 years or so in, and it's at the point that we've identified some unresolved issues between us and are working to improve communication and improve ourselves - both for ourselves and for each other.

I'm fairly good at moving past issues if I feel they've been addressed. I work hard to provide for us (I have 2 kids from my previous marriage). Admittedly, I have lead a fairly sheltered/privileged life. I have supportive family, decent education, not rich but feel secure in my job and future opportunities. I'm white, which comes with it's own unintended privileges, but I can certainly identify how the system has paved an easier road for me. Worst thing I've been through was a toxic 14 year relationship, but honestly, I feel over come through it better. 

My man has been through more than most people. Past relationships, jobs, betrayals by family members and friends, literal war, on top of having to deal with being a black man in America. But in addition to that, he is successful, loving, great sense of humor, a consistent provider, father, and natural leader - truly the kind of man that can bring out the best in people. And he loves me without a doubt and loves my kids. A lot of our life is fucking great. But then there's also the guy that gets overwhelmed and anxious (which, me too. We all do) - when that takes over, he kinda ruminates on past hurts; the big ones that have changed his life, but also the issues that we have gone through. Even the issues that we have addressed and behavior is changed, issues get brought back up, I feel blamed/defensive because I know the progress we have made that feels dismissed. He's expressed he has a hard time letting things go. In his words, ""I've been salty my whole life"". And I can understand this. It's valid. There's been a lot of just shitty things that were out of his control that disrupted his life and set him back for no good reason. But at the same time, his life - our life - is pretty good. He has come so fucking far and worked so hard - he deserves to be happy about it. The woulda/coulda/shoulda's really, really bother him. Again, life is short. I can understand the hurt for wasted time and missed opportunities - but it seems counterproductive to continue to allow these things so much influence on ones mind and behavior when they can't be changed - the present is pretty good all things considered and we can put down a solid foundation today for the future we want. Things outside our control will still happen, but...I choose hope over defeatism.

Obviously, I can't fix his.mindset for him. And I don't want to invalidate his feelings and experiences by comparing them to things I've been through and dealt with. For me, acknowledging that there is absolute shit in this world - but there's also some absolute beauty, helps me to cope with the bad stuff. There's a lot of awful, but also a lot to be grateful for. The present is pretty good and getting better for us - even if it can be exhausting too. And the biggest thing is - the world is outside of our control, we can only choose to make the best of it. I want to support him. But I need help. I'm trying not to take it personally, but sometimes I do feel like his dismissal of my worldview negates the places where we could connect and move forward and make him feel less alone. I know there is a lot I will never experience or understand. But at the same time - it does also start to wear on me that he feels so stuck and salty and applies this mindset to issues in our relationship as well. How can I encourage and support him in processing our spats as well as past traumas? Does anyone have any tips for helping a partner through similar issues? How do we break cycles like this?

TL;DR - Partner acknowledges he can't let go of both his past traumas and our own issues despite us working together to resolve previous miscommunications and hurts. How can I encourage him to healthily move forward without making it seem like ""just get over it"".  Does anyone have any tips for helping a partner when they are stuck?

ETA: Thank you all for being so compassionate and supportive! I truly appreciate the tools, tips, advice and success stories! It's refreshing to see so many people advocating for ways to work on ourselves together and how they fared through that process. Since I didn't put it in the original post, my partner HAS recently started therapy. His therapist is POC with military experience. I also have a therapist I've been with for a number of years. 

My take away is that I can do a better job of holding space for him and only listening (not trying to fix). While not my intent, my ""help"" is landing as dismissive/invalidating. If I'm starting to feel triggered/frustrated, I need to take a break and acknowledge how I am feeling without making him feel badly (making my feelings about his feelings forefront). However, if it gets nasty or disrespectful, disengage and take space until he/we are better regulated.  

You all have given us so many different therapeutic options  to look into and he will discuss with his therapist what he thinks would be beneficial. 

Thank you all so very much and from the bottom of my heart ❤️",1700167775.0,scienceandpuppies,relationship_advice
"UPDATE: 6 months postpartum, my (27F) fiancé tells me he (26M) ""loves me less."" How to navigate emotionally as a single parent?","Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/bciEC6GBRa

First, I want to thank everyone who commented on my original post. I mostly posted to vent, and I’m really glad I did.

Now for the update: I decided to rip the bandaid off and end things. Engagement is ended. Relationship is ended. All of it. 

After dinner, our son was taking a nap and I asked fiancé (26M) when he planned on moving out. Long story short, I had him pack a bag and stay elsewhere tonight. He will start packing his belongings tomorrow. I realized that I can’t do this - I can’t forgive being told he “loves me less.” That’s not the example (or standard) I want to set for my child as he grows. Love isn’t something you need to beg for, work for, or pretend. To make it worse, I asked fiancé (26M) if he felt this way when he got engaged last August, to which he said “Yes. I’ve just been lying to myself.” This man had a baby with me and knew (possibly beforehand) that his heart wasn’t in it, but didn’t have the guts to tell me. So here we are. 6 years down the drain. I’m not sure if the reality of a child hit him, if infidelity is involved on his part, or if he lost attraction to me in the process of being pregnant (could be all of the above), but I’ll never know. And that’s okay. 

I’m the primary provider for our son, and that won’t change. Our son (6 months) will remain living with me full-time, and fiancé is welcome to visit son. We will work out an agreement to ensure he fulfills his financial obligation to our child, and I’m not afraid to pursue the legal route if needed. 

I’m 6 months postpartum. This is my first. And wow, it’s been hard, but now I’m officially doing it solo (and with the help of my mom). I’m doing the damn thing, and I’m going to do my best. Wish me luck. 

Thank you, to everyone, for the words of encouragement. ",1724822401.0,Igloo2018,relationship_advice
My best friend 29 F would jokingly say she would marry my husband 30 M if he was single?,"What do I do with my best friend 29 F who I think has a crush on my husband 30 M? 

My best friend, let’s call her Ann, and I became close since the start of medical school, we have been best of friends for 7 years now. She was my maid of honor at my wedding and we’re still close to this day. My then boyfriend, let’s call him Jim, now my husband, came in the picture 4 years ago. 

Naturally, before my boyfriend became my husband, Ann along with our other best friend would hang out and eventually the four of us became close. I’m happy that my friends really liked my then boyfriend Jim now my husband, since they’ve seen the sh*tty men I dated before. 

They’ve seen how great of a catch Jim is. He’s really not the typical a**hole you meet. They would sometimes jokingly say that he really is the “husband of the group”, which is fine by me because he really cares about all of us and he’s just sweet like that (I promise you, it’s just his personality and no malice from his part) We would just randomly hang out at each others’ homes and Jim would cook for us since he’s a great chef and he cooks for his other friend groups as well. Typical hang outs outside too. Naturally, Jim became part of the group.

So now the dilemma is, when we get together with my friends, Ann would give comments like “If you were single Jim, I would’ve married you instead” or “What if we met before you met *my name*, I would’ve married you right then!” I would comment back jokingly that “What if you leave instead?” and then laugh it off. These comments would start when my best friends would compliment our relationship and how happy they are for us, and how lucky I am with Jim, etc. which is normal because my friends has always been endearing but nowadays, I don’t know how to deal or how to react because she’s my best friend and I talk to her about everything, except about my husband, since I never talk about our personal stuff to anyone. It’s okay to compliment the relationship but I just don’t like how she comments things like that.

I shared this to my husband before since this happened once in the past already before we even got married and he got the hint and was always distant with her and is very sensitive with my feelings and would just laugh off her comment when she says them. But I want to know about my best friend, and how to deal with her.

Note: A lot of you were commenting that Jim should have shut her down. Well he already did when she commented like this before we got married. Her comment then was “Do you have a twin or can I clone you? I’d marry that” and my husband said “I’m sure you’ll find someone who’s just perfect for you and not me, Don’t worry we’ll try to find you someone” This was a repeat, and we thought it had already stopped!",1723769801.0,Own_Habit405,relationship_advice
A strange young woman (19F) showed up on my (48M) door and I think she's my daughter. How do can I approach this with her delicately?,"I (48M) met my wife (44F) when I was in my mid to late 30s. I was a bachelor, never married, career and hobby focused and not open to a serious relationship. Two years later we were married, joyfully so, and we've had a really solid marriage. My wife and I are extremely close, share everything, and keep no secrets. Our kids are our 2 shih tzus and they run the house.

My wife is a school administrator and does mental health counseling. She is the sort of person who absolutely everyone loves, who everyone wants to be around. She lights up the room when she enters. But she has sadness in her too. She's not able to have children and stayed single for a very long time prior to us meeting because of that.

About a month ago, on a Saturday morning, the doorbell rang. My wife and the dogs answered it. I could tell my wife was having a hard time hearing over the barking so I walked over, picked up the shih tzu barking ring leader which always quiets him down, and saw a young woman standing there. She was nicely dressed and holding a file folder stuffed with papers. She introduced herself, looked me square in the eyes, and said more than asked ""You're so-and-so"" by name.

I immediately thought she was a process server and I was being sued. So I confirmed I was me and she asked if we could talk about a delicate family matter. My wife opened the door and invited her in. We sat at the dining room table and she began talking. She told us her name, we'll pretend it's ""Kate Doe"", her mother was ""Clara Doe"". I immediately recognized the name. I dated Clara, her mother, seriously 20 years ago. We broke up around 18 years ago due to a combination of factors limited to proximity to family, relocation, and work. Clara's only family were her parents who had retired to Florida and she had been struggling being away from them. Her mother and I loved each other very much but, sometimes love just isn't enough. I never heard from Clara again when she moved to be near them and my work kept me tethered to where I was living.

Anyway, Kate was there to settle her mother's will. She apologized to my wife citing how unusual and awkward this situation must be for her. Clara had left a box filled with memory cards which I knew must be filled with photos we had taken and printed photos of our time while dating and her sailboat to me. We had spent a tremendous amount of time on her boat when we were together, sailing all over the place in our area. It's a 45 foot blue water cruiser and was her prized possession. Over the years when I've thought back to Clara and that time in my life, my mind goes immediately to the time we spent on the boat.

The boat is a significant asset and I suggested to Kate that she take it instead, that it should go to her. But she insisted that this was what her mother wanted and she agreed with her mother on that, and that her mother had taken care of her, she wasn't in need of anything, and that she hoped I would feel comfortable accepting it. As it turns out Kate's grandparents passed about 10 years ago and now that her mother has passed, she had no family left. That she had the same last name as Clara meant to me that her father wasn't in the picture for whatever reason. And she told us that the boat was too much for her to take care of properly.

So I signed some paperwork to transfer the title. We spoke a while about Kate, how she's holding up, if there was anything we could do for her. My wife gave her our contact info, which she obviously already had but it was an intentional gesture from my wife, and encouraged her to reach out to either of us if there was anything we could do for her or if she ever wanted to talk.

And then she left.

Over the next week or so we worked with her over email to travel to Florida to assess the boat and to ""maybe spend a little time seeing the area together"". My wife and Kate had taken to messaging a lot over FB Messenger casually chatting about mundane life things. At the same time, my wife and I began speculating about how wild and unusual this situation is. We're both thinking that Kate might be a child I never knew I had. I think the timing for it lines up, if she was born about 9 months after we broke up. It was so long ago that I can't remember the dates but am fairly confident about the year.

We traveled the Florida. We stayed in a hotel for two nights and spent Friday evening through Sunday afternoon with Kate. We spent a good portion of Saturday on the boat. It has been impeccably maintained. Yes, some minor things but every boat has minor things. Boats are holes you toss money and time into. After that, we hung out with Kate and learned about her life, told her about ours, saw the area, had some good food. Then we flew home.

We're now planning on sailing the boat back up to where I live when the weather warms up more by way of the ICW. The three of us. Sometime in June or July.

So that's the background. I want to confront Kate about who her father is. I don't know if she knows and is keeping it from me, if she doesn't know, if it's someone else. She looks just like her mother. When I look at her, her face, her eyes, it's like I'm looking at her mother. Her hair is slightly darker than her mother's blond and super bushy / curly... like my hair, and probably half the population's hair.

How do I ~~confront~~ engage in discussion with a deceased ex-girlfriends kid about parentage? I feel that my wife and I have a right to know if she's my kid and that I have a right to be there for her, even if it's just in waiting if she wants nothing to do with me after this. But she's also going through a lot - not just in losing her mother, which I'm honestly feeling loss about as well because her mother was a truly kind and good person, but in facing the reality that she no longer has living family. I also don't want to chase her away or overwhelm her by adding to everything that she's going through. I feel like we're building a friendship and want to handle this delicately. How do you raise this in discussion? If any of you have been through something similar, how did you handle it and would you recommend a similar approach?

tl;dr I think I have a daughter who showed up on my doorstep to settle her mother's will and want to determine if she actually is and have no idea how to do that delicately and responsibly?

My (24M) girlfriend (26F) fully believes that she is a cat in a human's body.,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8wzqq/update_my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Tl;dr: gf now thinks she is an otherkin, a cat in a human's body and refuses to see anything wrong with the situation. The echo chamber she is now has done nothing but enable her and I don't know what to do.

I know people are going to think I'm either trolling or baiting but please read before you comment + this post has nothing to do with gender or trans issues and I am in no way intending to be offensive or anything.

So Gf and I have been together for nearly 8 months, and she's always been a very quirky and nerdy person: does cosplays, very into anime and roleplaying, etc... Nothing too weird. We've been kinda distant lately with everything going on and me being an essential worker so haven't seen eachother and only talk for half an hour a day. Well, last tuesday we got to hang out at her place and she wore cat ears a and a belt with a tail the entire time. At first I thought it was either going to be a sex surprise or her testing  a new cosplay, but nope, she sat me down, asked me if I really do love her, then hit me with a very long monologue that essentially summed up to  ""I'm a cat in a human body"". Wish I was joking.

I thought I misunderstood and then believed that maybe it was a weird joke but she kept being serious about it, and doubling down. I left shortly after because I had a shift at work, and I still believed it was an oddly drawn out joke nothing more. She ended up texting me with resources to help me understand, which is when I realized that she really is serious. Apparently she believes she is an otherkin:  a person who holds the belief that they are not human. She says she was introduced to this by one of her friends months ago and has since joined discords and communities of others like her. Her friend believes he is a demon trapped in a human body, and she sent me a testimonial that was supposed to be touching but its basically just about a dude thinking he is naruto. I'm not joking. She explained her otherkin type as being a cat, and now she 100% thinks she is a cat. How did she know she was a cat you ask? According to her: sleeping a lot, liking the sun, hating water,  feeling more comfortable crawling on all fours, and claiming to understand what cats are saying and being able to talk to them through meowing. She has also apparently been distant with nearly everybody we know IRL as I got multiple messages asking me to let her know to be in touch with them.

My head has been spiraling this past week, I keep thinking its a joke but nope she is deathly serious about this and has handed in her two weeks resignation at her job because cats don't work. Again, I wish I was joking. I've been limiting my interactions with her ever since, because this is hurting my head a whole lot and I just can't cope. She has also surrounded herself with a large amount of yes men and women who support her 100% and are enabling this, some even encouraging her to make a patreon and make otherkin content that they would contribute to, which she brought up when I asked her about quitting her job. To make things worse, I can't discuss this with anyone in real life because I know how crazy it sounds and I know that leaving her is a valid option but I'm in love with this woman and now I don't recognize her and I know that there is something very very wrong and I can't reach out to her and she refuses to hear anything from me unless it is unconditional support. What the fuck do i do ?

EDIT: Just got off work and was very surprised with the amount of comments, I honestly just expected a bunch calling me crazy. I'm reading through them now and I want to say thank you to everybody who took the time out of their day to give me advice, I truly appreciate it. To address some things:

\- Her and I have been friends for 2+ years prior to dating, so that is why I am reluctant to just up and leave.

\- I've read a comment asking if she has a history of mental illness, and not to my knowledge? Aside from her being diagnosed with mild social anxiety in high school. I am going to try and reach out to her mom to get her to check up on her, and maybe even visit. They have a good relationship, so maybe that will help.

\- Yesterday was the first time I truly confronted what was going on, as I have been kind of shelving it and just praying and hoping it was some kind of drawn out joke. But now that I've had time to truly ponder it, I think it has been a long time coming. She's been buying a lot of cat memorabilia and a lot of her cosplays are cat related, and when I brought up the possibility of me getting a cat in the near future she made a joke about being too territorial for a cat, and now that I think about it...well, yeah.

\-I don't know who demon man really is, all I know is that he has been part of her virtual Dnd group since last year. Also so far no litterbox in the picture, sorry to disappoint/relieve some of you. When I asked her about her plans as a ""cat"" other than quitting her job, she had sent me her to do list which I didn't bother opening or reading until yesterday because I was too busy wishing all of this was a fever dream. The To do list includes purchasing a scratch post for her nails, switching to an carnivore diet, and dying her hair red because she is a ginger cat. Yup.

\-As much as it hurts, I have no intention to continue to be in a romantic relationship with her because she will absolutely not hear anything if it's not 100% support. I love her, but I love myself and I don't want to be dragged down to something like this especially when it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I will however try to remain in contact with her just to make sure she's not spiraling towards a mental break. I will visit her today to have a talk and officially break it off even though she's been refusing to see me unless I am completely on board, I will update if anything interesting happens. Then I will buy a couple of bottles of alcohol and down them in my flat, no judgement.

\-I've really enjoyed the cat puns, and apparently I need to google who Maureen is.",1591927135.0,ThrowRA20202004,relationship_advice
My girlfriend of nearly 5 years is encouraging me to try sleeping with someone else,"For context, we just got done with our usual nightly business. Out of the blue she mentions that I should try sleeping with someone else, and that it's just ""sex"". She says it's because she wants to know if she's doing a good job in the bedroom compared to other people. In addition, she was incredibly pushy about me ""getting out there,"" I had to have said ""no"" at least 30 times. This made me incredibly uncomfortable so I expressed my concerns and mentioned how I saw it as a red flag. She, however, did not see the problem with anything she said.

Some other important things to note: she says that she personally does not want to do anything like that. She also says it's not a ""trap"" question. Thoughts?",1605505322.0,zepz12,relationship_advice
My antivax mom started crying after I said I didn't want to associate with anti-vax protesters and threatened not to help me pay for college if I got a flu shot.,"So, to preface, I (17F) am an incoming freshman in college. I'm going to a UC (won't say which for obvious reasons), but I got into the school's semi-competitive engineering program and it was one of my top choices for college. I absolutely love the school. Unfortunately, the UC system just instituted a new rule that all students need to get a flu shot before they can attend. My mom (50F) has been incredibly upset about this for the past two days.

She called me up about an hour ago to talk about how I wanted to ""deal"" with the problem of having to get a flu shot.

She was asking me to reconsider going to another college halfway across the country because they don't require flu shots. The school is not nearly as good in terms of engineering, it's a long way away and it's expensive as hell for out of state students. I have zero desire to go there. I told her this wasn't the hill I wanted to die on, I don't think getting a flu shot is really that big of a deal and I certainly don't want it to be the reason I end up not going my top choice college.

She got kinda angry with me and basically implied that she wouldn't pay for me to attend college if I got the shot, I would be completely on my own.

Then she said, ""Why don't you march your protester self (I organized a BLM march in our city back in June, so she's referencing that) down to city hall. I'm sure you can find people who will protest with you.""

And I responded, ""I'm not sure I want to associate with those people,"" which I know was super mean and sounds awful to me in hindsight. She started crying and hung up on me after I said that.

My mom and I seem to be at odds about everything right now. She was upset with me for organizing the BLM march, she doesn't like most of my political views, and she's even threatened to burn a book I was reading by Richard Dawkins about evolution because ""he advocated for cannibalism"" (???) and she seems to vaguely think evolution is a lie, despite not be religious so far as I can tell.  I also had to get a series of vaccinations in ninth grade to attend my high school, which my dad took me to get and which my mom is still extremely upset about almost four years later. I feel like this whole disaster is going to be the final straw though.

I just really need some advice on how to deal with this before she comes home from work and gets super mad and starts yelling at me.

Edit: Okay, I just want to add because people keep suggesting this, I can't exactly go behind her back here and get the shot on my own. Like, physically yes I can walk to Walgreens and get it. But being allowed to go to college = got the flu shot. She will know, and therein lies the problem. Also, I know my mom sounds kinda bad on paper (or ""on Reddit"") but she really is a loving and caring person who is attempting to look out for me in her own way, so please stop with the name-calling. I came here asking for help, not asking you to shit on my mom. It's just not helpful or productive. Thanks.

Edit 2: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading every single one of your comments. I want to answer everyone's questions, but that might take a while as I'm still working out how to deal with this situation with my dad. Thanks to the people who have been helpful, supportive, and encouraging with their advice. I'll update soon.",1597177999.0,ThrowRA_AntivaxMom,relationship_advice
Should I [40F] report my niece [17F] to the police?,"My parents are going away for Christmas, so before they did they hosted an early Christmas party at their home, which my whole family went to including me my husband and our 16 year old daughter Laura.

My sister and her daughter Rachel were there too. She's a year older than Laura and they don't get along. In fact we try to avoid them as much as we can due to amount of times that Rachel has upset and tormented Laura. Rachel is naturally very smart and is always top of her class, and is also very pretty. While I've always been happy for her and wished her the best, these things have constantly been used to excuse her. My sister even went as far as to accuse Laura of lying because she is jealous of Rachel's looks and talents.

Laura took up boxing last year and has progressed really well. She's going to compete at a higher level next year and her coach is extremely proud of her. My sister has insisted that the boxing is nothing more than ''a phase'' and has gone out of her way to downplay it in favour of her daughter's academic stuff.

At my parents place Laura went to sort out some presents under the tree, and Rachel followed her. She was wearing stiletto high heels, and when Laura had her hand on the floor Rachel stamped on it. She was in agony.

We went to the hospital, and after a follow up visit to the doctor today Laura needs extensive physio, and will not be able to box for an indefinite period. She's in floods of tears because of this.

I was raging at my sister, who is so deluded that she insists that it was an accident. I'm sorry, but after years of calling Laura ugly, stupid, fat and anything else she could think of do you really expect me to believe that this was an innocent mistake? Rachel for her part put on the crocodile tears for everyone, and only her parents believed it.

My husband wants to tell the police and I do too. I warned my sister about this, and she broke down crying too, saying that her daughter's teachers have encouraged her to apply to the top universities because they think she's got a good chance of getting in, and that if she ends up with a criminal record then that will be ruined.

No sympathy from me. Frankly Rachel took something that my daughter loves away from her and left her in huge amounts of pain. She shouldn't just have her chances ruined, she should get locked up.

I know it sounds awful of me but she did an awful thing and needs to face the consequences. Laura is utterly heartbroken and Rachels parents won't punish her.",1576770657.0,ThrowRA-niecepolice,relationship_advice
My (35M) mother (67F) encouraged my ex wife to leave me. She won’t take accountability. How do I find peace? ,"Hi, thank you for reading🙏🙏🙏. I’m desperate for any input… 

My (35M) mother (67F) lives with a lot of trauma from her childhood. Her father threatened to kill her, ripped her hair out of her head and kicked her down the stairs as a teen. She woke up to her mother beating her up. Her mother never told her she loved her but wanted a son and both her mom and dad used her for their business without paying her until she left home at 16 with nothing more than a sleeping bag to start a new life for herself.

All her family suffered a lot of abuse from their parents. My mother doesn’t believe in seeing a therapist so she swept it under the carpet but she was a very toxic parent to me growing up. She threatened to remove me from my family when I was 7. She kicked me out of my home when I was a teenager which led to me being homeless for a time period. If my mom does anything wrong, she has a victim mentality and blames everyone else for her actions. She has always been like this. 

Well, two years ago my ex wife left me for another married man. It was fair of her to leave me (we had a tough marriage and I caused damage, but how she went about it IMO was not ok). I protected her and didn’t tell my family about the affair as she protected my reputation to her and my family by not divulging my toxic behaviour in our marriage which I acknowledge as 100% my fault. When I told my mom she was leaving me, my mom said she was angry at her for doing this to me. I asked her to be nice as I was trying to save my marriage and didn’t want her to burn bridges. I was certain my ex was cheating on me so I checked her laptop text messages and found a bunch of texts to her from my mother encouraging her to leave me thinking it was best for us both as we had a difficult marriage. 

I felt incredibly betrayed by my mom. When I confronted her about it she told me she was sorry for telling my ex, “Off and on I was troubled by how much pains you two were in, so I prayed God would give one of you the strength to walk away. I guess the one he gave the strength to was you. I’m happy for you” but she said she wasn’t going to apologize for having her own opinion. 
Her opinion was the following texts to my ex-wife: 

“I don’t know why anyone wants to get married again but I hopes you find someone who is on the same page as you academically and can give you the freedom you need”

“All marriages are hard and suck and if I would do it again, I wouldn’t have married Erik. Everything was a struggle and that’s how it was”

I took care of my dad and mom for three months when he was dying of cancer and spent an entire year supporting her after but in my time of need I feel that she stabbed me in the back. My mom never apologized for what she did but it came to the surface in a phone convo a few days ago. She ended the phone call and said she needed to think about it. 

Then she emailed this, “Hi, I was going to call and try to apologize but you wouldn't accept my last two apologies so I figured I would send this last one.I have read the emails you sent.  I know what I did and said to both you and Kristina caused you a great deal of pain and heartache and I'm deeply sorry for that.  You feel I stabbed you in the back and have been betrayed by me.  I apologize for this as well.  It definitely wasn't my intent.  I apologize for the trauma and suffering I have caused you.”

This feels like a backhanded apology. She never apologized for her actions before. She is apologizing for my feelings and clearly doesn’t think she did anything wrong. I hate her for doing this to me and struggle to forgive. She will never recognize what she did. How do I proceed when she is so emotionally immature? She always thinks she is the victim.

*How do I respond to her email? 

TL; DR :my mom encouraged my ex wife to leave me when we were struggling in marriage. In the end, my ex left me for another man. How to I find peace with my mom?

My (23M) girlfriend’s (22F) diet is making her crazy. How to do I reason with her?,"ThrowRA - she uses reddit more than me.

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her. 

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube. 

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?

**last edit: I have been trying to reply to almost all the comments as they come in, and I know I didn’t get all of them, but I really do appreciate all of the insight that everyone has offered, except of course for people like my friends who are featured in the first two edits for suggesting that I break up with my girlfriend… But that’s beside the point. I think I have a good idea of the next steps that I should take as a supportive boyfriend to encourage her to get the help that she needs, and I’m hoping to be able to update you all on this soon. The only thing I haven’t enjoyed about this experience is the fact that this account that I just made this morning now has three times as much karma as my main. Thanks again**

How do I (26 F) deal with my boyfriend’s (31 M) political radicalization?  ,"I’ve been with my bf for around 5 years and we have had an okay relationship with a few ups and downs but we have leveled out to a good place in the last 2 or so years except for an alarming rabbit hole he has been drifting down. 

When we first got together my boyfriend told me he had no political interest but I learned throughout the span of our 5 years together that he is more conservative oriented with a few of his views. This wasn’t a deal breaker since it wasn’t a huge part of our relationship and he still managed to keep it respectful even though I am more liberal-leaning. The issues really started to ramp up a bit after Trump left office and during his current political campaign my bf decided he was his preferred politician. I think all politicians are shitty but am a default democrat so this was a bit of an issue for me. Again though, it wasn’t something I cared enough to push him on and he didn’t watch the news or bring it up a lot so I let it go.

In the last two or so months though he has begun consuming TikTok media made by creators who are serial debate-lords and spend all day debating polarizing political topics with random strangers on TikTok live feeds. This has lit some spark under my bf’s ass and now he’s decided that I’m a perfect target for his newly learned debate-lord knowledge and has been trying to argue with me over every little political thing we disagree on. The biggest issue is that our opinions are SO different listening to him talk about it is causing me real distress. His opinions were usually almost neutral and now he’s been radicalized in the direction opposite my own. 

Our most recent heated debate (ugh) was about Women’s Reproductive Health Rights (abortion basically). We were in the car together, he opened with some line about how abortions should be illegal and I rose to the bait. Now I don’t really care who is right and wrong. The core of this issue is that we have two opposing views and he will not leave me alone about it. In the car he got so fired up by the fact that I refused to relent and agree with him that he started yelling about it, as if his volume would suddenly cause a moment of holy enlightenment and I’d instantly 180 on my hard set views. I tried to end the conversation by saying he was yelling, and I was not interested in having this conversation anymore because I am unmovable on my opinion, it will not change, and thus our arguing about it isn’t productive. He kept bringing up more points, then attacking my character over it “it’s messed up that you think that way and so are you”(you get the gist). The only way I ended the “debate” (ew) was by refusing to reply to anything he said on the topic. 

We live together. We have 3 dogs + 1 cat and have been planning on having a kid in the coming year. But this new political radicalization is making a lot of our conversations stressful. I don’t want to have to argue about issues I won’t change my mind on. I also don’t think it’s really reasonable to give up a 5 year relationship with a reliable man I care about just because he’s being sucked into a political black hole, but I’m scared it will become unbearable and he’ll turn into the annoying conservative dinner uncle no one wants to be around. Hell, if his opinions take too much of a cliff dive I won’t even want be around him either. 

As a side note he is, like me, not the type to change his opinion just because I tell him I don’t like it. He’s stubborn. ",1729912791.0,trivial_query,relationship_advice
[Update] I (27M) just found out my girlfriend (24F) is lying about being on a trip. How do I confront her?,"NEW EDIT#2 DATED 10/23/24 BELOW

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/b7br03HAIJ

Hey everyone, I had some DMs asking for an update so here it is. 

To quickly summarize my last post: A few weeks back my girlfriend was supposed to go on a trip a few states away to go to a conference. I came to find out that the conference was cancelled and she didn’t actually go, and never even bothered to tell me. She lied by omission about it by not telling me when I texted her to have a good flight. I found out she didn’t go because her best friend posted a picture of them at a show in our local nearby city.

So here we are, almost a month later. I was wreck and spiraling these past few weeks, and after being together for almost two years I was too panicked to reach out and ask to see her. During the three weeks since her planned trip, she hasn’t reached out once to me. 

That was until yesterday, when she casually reached out like we hadn’t just ignored each other for 3 weeks and asked to see a movie. So I just finally saw her tonight. In the car I asked about her trip. Her facial response was really weird like she got caught off guard. I’m guessing she was expecting me to forget about it after a few weeks of not seeing her. She just said “it was ok” which instantly confirmed my suspicions. I asked her what she had done and she said she went to that conference one day (which as I said in my last post was cancelled), and went to a show after before returning home the day after I made my original post. I asked her which and she claimed the show that was in our local city.

I was driving at the time and it was dark out, so I waited to confront her as I didn’t want to get emotional and endanger us. I confronted her for lying about the trip, doubling down and lying about the conference, and tripling down to lie about the show. Her immediate response was to start deflecting, saying that if this is making me upset to imagine how she felt that her conference and trip was cancelled. She said how she was so heartbroken and upset that the conference was cancelled (which was cancelled 5 weeks ago) that she didn’t want to talk about it. She kept saying that she doesn’t owe it to me or anybody else to tell us about her business and what’s going on in her life. I of course called her out for gaslighting me, to which her response was that she was not gaslighting me. Kind of ironic I guess. When I talked about how it made me feel and that she damaged my trust for her, she again tried to belittle my feelings by rolling her eyes and saying that it was only a show.

This conversation ended up opening to a much bigger issue in our relationship that I didn’t mention in my last post. Generally, Amy treated me really poorly throughout the  relationship. She was hot and cold, put zero effort into communication, and it never felt like she made a priority. She’d give me zero affection or compliments despite drooling and crushing over male celebrities all day. She’s made little effort to connect me and her family and friends. We’ve talked about all of this a few times now, she would always say she was overwhelmed with some new excuse and promise it would get better. I would cave in and agree to work through things. As expected, things never got better. This time was the same, where she blamed a new job for being overwhelmed and that’s why she’s been so distant.  

But this time was different. I guess her blatant lie to my face and your guys comments in the back of my mind gave me power to put my foot down. I broke up with her then and there. She kept begging me for one more chance, to think on it for a few days, that she cares about me and didn’t intend to hurt me, all that nonsense. But the whole time I was the one bawling, and there wasn’t a tear on her face. 

It really broke my heart ending things but I’ve also really grown to hate myself for putting up with her treatment for so long. I’m hurting a lot right now, and I’m scared to get back into the dating world after two years of aging and some weight gain. I really loved her with every bit of my heart and I’m terrified to picture my life without her. I really want to call her up and give her one final chance to get things right but I know I’d never forgive myself if she didn’t change and broke my heart again. Im hurting bad and I could really use some words of encouragement right now.

Thank you all. 

EDIT: I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone for the overwhelming positivity. I didn’t expect this post to blow up did but I’m glad it did. It really helped solidify me knowing that I made the right choice, even if it’s hurting right now. I miss my ex a lot but I’m a little more confident that things will work out in the long run now. It’s gonna be a scary road but I’m glad it’s finally started. Thank you all again

EDIT 2, 1 week later: Hi all. Just going to make a update cause I’ve seen this post reach a few subreddits and tiktok accounts (including my favorite tiktok Reddit stories account lol). I’ve replied to a decent bit of comments providing some more context and clarifications such as timelines of things, why I stayed for so long, why I accepted her neurodivergence as an excuse, etc. I’m sorry I can’t get to all of the comments, there’s so many. I’ve just come for a few brief updates and clarifications. I’ll try to keep it short but I do tend to ramble a little. 

Like you all suggested, I’ve removed Amy on social media. I did it really late one night when I couldn’t sleep, a few hours after she normally sleeps. I woke up about 5 hours later for work, around the time when she wakes up, and decided I should block her so I don’t get ever tempted to look at her profiles or give her a chance to contact me. She already beat me to the punch and blocked me first thing in the morning. I’m not sure how to block her when I’m blocked, but I guess this gets the job done. 

I wanted to address one comment — a lot of people are asking why I originally said our relationship was pretty good and waited to drop the bombshell of everything until my update. Honestly, I just wanted unbiased opinions on the original situation, like if there was any reason why somebody in a healthy relationship would have not told me about the trip cancellation. I was naive and was hoping that there’d be some reasoning that I wasn’t seeing, and that we could work through this issue. I knew that Amy had been treating me poorly outside of this issue, but it felt like her treatment of me was kind of on the upswing and that we were growing closer, until she stonewalled me for 3 weeks after my first post. Before my first post, I felt like one final talk with her would really keep us on the right path and hopefully fix things for good. Obviously I was naive and stupid for thinking that, and let my love for her blind me to the obvious, but hindsight is 20/20. It’s hard to recognize that emotionally abusive relationships arent going to change when you’re in them. Reflecting back there were always times when she’s briefly treat me well to pull me back in. I’d guess that’s what was going on recently but who knows. 

And to the people suggesting that we weren’t actually in a relationship, that we had different agreements of what the relationship meant, and that I belong in a psych ward, thanks. Appreciate that. But no. When we were still “seeing each other” (as in, after a few dates) I specifically asked her to be exclusive and she said yes. Once I felt ready, I sat her down, told her how much I cared about her, and asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed and we’ve been bf/gf ever since. We’ve posted each other on Valentine’s Day, and both had pictures of each other on social media. When talking to others, she introduced me to them as her boyfriend. We’ve been on weekend trips away together with my friends. Early on, we had conversations about what we want in terms of kids, marriage, where to live, etc to make sure we were on the same page. While I might’ve been naive and had heavy rose-tinted glasses, I’m not some psycho stalker. She knew we were in a relationship, treated me like crap, acknowledged that my feelings were valid all of the times that I brought up her treatment of me, and when I broke up with her she begged me to take a few days and reconsider. This wasn’t some fantasy you’d see in a creepy movie.

To end off my update, im doing okay. I was really sad the first two days, but that’s passed. I am still in pain, grieving, and thinking about her, but there is some relief from all the comments reinforcing that I made the right choice. Things are hard right now but I know I’ve made the best choice in for me and my well-being. Thanks all again, and hopefully this is the end of my time here.

I canceled the wedding. I apologized to my mom for letting him speak to her like that, even tho I was telling him to stop, I could have been more serious about it. 
His mom understands my position and respects my decision. I am really sad but some how I feel relief as well. I will try to enjoy th rest of this trip with my family and try to get passed this. Thank you for so many answers, it definitely encouraged me. My mom is also relief that I made this decision, my whole family is.

I’ll try to make this short while I cry of sadness. 
I’ve been dating this guy since jun 2022 and in sept 2022 he asked me to be his girlfriend and in April 2023 he asked me to marry him. So we’ve been engaged since then and came to Hawaii with his mom and dad and with my mom, my dad, my sister and best friend. 

90% of the time he’s a calm person, he opens the door of the car for me, kisses me every morning and every night, he’s a gentleman and a very loyal and honest person

The other 10% when we fight he insults me “fake, know it all, psycho, piece of shit, you don’t give a shit about me, this relationship is a joke” etc. 

Yesterday was our first day in Hawaii and in two different occasions his behavior in front of everyone in the table was intense and out of this line, he started yelling just because we disagree that not all Italians hate Americans. (I’m from South America and so it’s my family and he’s from the US, but we all live in the US) 
And then at some point my sisters boyfriend was like “it’s always greener on the other side” and he started getting very passionate and saying “not it’s not always greener, you are mistaken”. Anyways the whole conversation in the table was uncomfortable because he was way to intense even his mom told him to calm down. 

Then we went to car and I asked him NICELY to please chill and that his attitude made me feel uncomfortable, he started yelling to me saying I’m dramatic and overreacting because that’s his personality. A couple people from the resort asked me if I was ok after they saw the whole scene. Because btw he doesn’t care about making scenes anywhere we are. He will yell and raise his voice whenever we are in public anything we get into sn argument. 

Anyways, that went away and he apologized to my sisters boyfriend and told him that’s usually how he speaks to all of his friends. 

After that, we were all at the beach (my part of the family and him) and his mom and dad were at the grocery store, we didn’t didn’t check in in our rooms yet because the room wasn’t ready but after hanging out at the beach for like an hour he was ready to go and I said but your mom isn’t here yet we can chill a little longer, he got all stressed out and said he wanted to go to the room and start getting ready to go to Waikiki downtown and that everyone should do that. He was very pushy and also yelled again and got intense with the group and made us all leave and change so we can go to downtown. I told him when we were alone that he was being rude and pushy again and that he should apologize. 

After convincing him for a while that he was been rude out there, he texted my sister and her boyfriend saying “sorry I was all intense, every time during this time of the year when my birthday is coming I get emotional because I remember my sister and that’s not an excuse but I’m just not in the best place” btw he lost his sister 6 years ago, he was 23 and his sister was 10. 

This isn’t the first time he yells and behaves incorrectly and uses his sister as the motive for it. 

Then we were on the car with my mom and he wanted to Apologize to my mom too and this is where shit got ugly. He apologized to my mom and says how he wishes his sister was here in these important moments and that he is sorry for everything from today. And then my mom says. Ok your apologies are accepted but please don’t use your sister an an excuse. Respect her memory. She also said the way she respects my dads memory is by always trying to be happy around the people she loves. Because she know he wouldn’t want to see her cry everyday or yell at us or anything like that, so that’s the way she deals with my fathers death. Then my fiancé said “you don’t know anything about my sister or myself and I can get to feel how ever I want” Things kept going heated and more yelling started happening and he started yelling very loudly “don’t talk about my sister you don’t know shit” started giving my mom crazy eyes and pointing at her, completely disrespected somebody that’s on her 60s. Then my mom just left the car and after an hour of me trying to explain to my fiancé that what he did was wrong he said ok I will apologize to her, then I call my mom and she’s crying and she’s like I’m sorry I don’t want his apologizes this went too far. He also insulted me multiple times.

I told my fiancé even if my mom was wrong you could have just talk to her instead of starting yelling and cursing at her. 

My wedding is supposed to be in Two days here in Hawaii (we all flew here for the wedding purpose) and my mom was supposed to give us the rings. This morning she texted me saying that she loves and and I can do whatever I decided to do but she won’t give me the rings and won’t accept his apologizes and if I do Marry him she will stand there just to soporto me but after that when we go back home she won’t be close to him and will try to avoid talking to him from now on because her perspectives of him has changed completely.

I truly don’t what what to do and I need an outsiders perspective. Should I marry this man? 

TL,DR 
My fiancé (male, 29) disrespected my mother (f61) and yelled and cursed at her 2 days before our wedding.

I (26f) am an escort and I am falling in love with one of my clients (39M),"If you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me I am being exploited please don't I am not here for that.

&#x200B;

I took on this client about a year ago. I was immediately struck with how handsome he was. As I got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. He is always gentle I never had to enforce any boundaries with him. Over the last year I have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. If there's a scheduling conflict I will give him the priority, lately I have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things I dont do with my other clients. I love my overnights with him. We have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. I feel very safe with him.

&#x200B;

I am falling in love with him. Its never happened to me before. I have always kept emotion separate from my work but I cant help it with him. I will spend time with him I dont bill him for, I spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. I've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates I guess for lack of better word that I'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  I dont know what to do. I think I want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but I cant imagine he would be ok with my work if I was his gf. I am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, I think I would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200B;

I dont know what to do. Do I go for it? Risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? Do I give up my career for him if he says yes? I dont think I could continue this if I was with him personally. Do I just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? Or do I drop him as a client altogether? I was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but I cant help what I'm feeling for him.

&#x200B;

\*Edit\*I know why hes single. His wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

Edit2 I cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. I am going for it. I'll tell him this week. Now to figure out how. Lots had asked if I have a back up I do.

Edit 3 I'm about to leave for lunch with him. I'm not going to bring it up yet but I do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. Thanks for all the support. I didn't expect to see this much support.

Edit 4 Lunch was nice. We had a good time. I did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. Then he asked me if I ever saw myself getting married and I had a similar answer, I told him I asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. He said he's like that. I'm going for it.

Final Update 

Well I truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. I didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. I really didn't expect all the support I got. I was flooded with Comments, Pms and chat requests. Some were about what I expected. Accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response I expected. What I didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. You were all right in that I did know what I really wanted. I did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push I needed to not waste anymore time. Shoot your shot right?

&#x200B;

I'd like to address a few things before I get into the update

&#x200B;

A few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. I was pretty sure he wasn't married I did out-calls to his home and my married clients NEVER take me to their home always a hotel. But I was regularly in his home, I saw the pictures of her around the house I know she was real. 

&#x200B;

How can I trust a guy who uses escorts? Well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what I do. I cant imagine judging a man for using my service. I was his first too and unless hes a good actor I know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. I never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200B;

I should wait for him to approach me. Unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. As the lines became blurred I did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous I had to drop. I am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. I had to be the one to make this move

&#x200B;

Do I want to do this forever/Do I really want to give it up? Different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. Some in favor some against. Bottom line is I don't think I see myself doing this into my 30's. It used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets I look forward to anymore are the ones with him. I also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. I heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but I just cant. Even if he would be ok with it I just cant. Another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what I do. Shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200B;

A lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. I imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so I'll put it here. We have been. For some time now. We meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. We also text throughout the week. 

&#x200B;

Ok on to the Update. I think I left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. This was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. I posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. He said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. Then he followed up with a question about if I would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. And I sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. He had to go back to work by this point and I invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. He has never been to my home. I dont bring clients back there only friends. I hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200B;

I went back home and started getting ready, I had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. I called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as Reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" I told her about the reddit post and said I was making the jump. I also let her know I wanted to take her up on her offer. I called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. I said something had come up and I wouldn't be available. I'm out. I'm done regardless of what happened with him If I cant get my head in the game anymore and I'm getting too personal, plus now I am realizing I want to be in a relationship and I cant separate sex from my feelings like I thought, its time to call it. This isn't what I want anymore. This choice was for me not him. Even if things didn't work out with him I realized I really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. One thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when I told him. I honestly didn't believe he would but I asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. She knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200B;

I got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. He came by at around 7. He had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. I invited him. He said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. I told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. I dont bring clients to my home. I was really hoping he was getting the hint. Dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but I could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. So I put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""Shoot my shot"" as you all put it. I told him I was dropping him as a client. He looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? What did he do wrong? Did something happen. I assured him it want about him. I was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. I told him about the job I took and he wished me good luck, he said I was attractive and charming and he was sure I would do well in sales. He said he was going to miss me. I took a big deep breath and said. ""You dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" And then I spilled it. He was the only client I brought home to tell in person. I laid it all out all the things I mentioned in the post. How I felt about him and how I didnt want to be his escort anymore. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I said I understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now I was asking to stick around and I would understand if he didnt want to continue on. He said who told you that? That he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. He said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. He was still hurt over his wife And that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. He asked me if I was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. I told him I could work with it and that I wasn't trying to replace her. We kissed. I led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200B;

We spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. He offered to help me make the transition but I told him I wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. I appreciated his offer and if I needed the help I would ask but I need to do try on my own at first. He respected that. I told him that things would change now. As his GF I would have expectations of him I never had as an escort. He was ok with that. I told him I never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now I wanted monogamy I would give it and I wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and I reminded him I dropped my clients. He said that wasn't a problem. I was the only one. He spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200B;

Where is this going to lead us next? I have no idea. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was God working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. Fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. I'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. My whole life has drastically changed in just a day. I didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200B;

To everyone who said I was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but I have to find out, To everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it I would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200B;

As a final thought I want to say that this isn't normal. If you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. While I'm sure it happens and Ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. If you're considering Sex Work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. Oh and I hated Pretty Woman btw. I never thought it would be me one day.

UPDATE: My brothers (27m) girlfriend (26f) made an “alter” of my child,"
Update to my post [here](https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/e7x08MXQoD)


So to start things off, my wife and I have done a lot of research into Dissociative Identity Disorder. Right off the bat, I’ll be blunt here. I don’t believe in the “fad” DID, or anything that goes along with it. 

I don’t think people are “programmed” to be systems. I don’t think people make “fictives” over characters from TV or movies. I definitely don’t think it’s possible to make an “alter” of a specific three year old girl. I think that’s all attention seeking BS. **I don’t know about the validity of actual DID, if it does exist, because at this point it is being faked so much it’s impossible to figure out if it’s an actual disorder or not.** I definitely don’t think if someone did actually have DID they would be on Reddit casually talking and making videos about “meeting the alters” and BS like that. ([And no, I don’t think being in the DSM proves ANY validity whatsoever](https://mdrnyu.org/2016-fall-the-dsm-and-its-flawed-use-in-modern-day-psychological-diagnosis/).) I do think if you really are convinced you have DID you probably do have some sort of disorder that you should get checked out with an actual, reputable doctor. 

Now that’s out of the way, my wife and I have heard from my brother after the party. He still thinks we owe his girlfriend an apology. We told him that he owes us an apology for not telling us about his girlfriends erratic and psychotic behavior. (I’m not using the term psychotic to be insulting. I really do think she’s experiencing some sort of psychosis.) My wife told him that due to his extraordinary lack of judgment in bringing her around our family, and our kids, when he knew about this, we didn’t really feel comfortable having him around our children without one of us directly there either.

We encouraged him to get her to see an actual doctor and get checked out. We told him we’d be willing to help her look for doctors in the area if she needed support and didn’t want to involve her family in this for whatever reason. But we also told him under no circumstances will she be allowed around our children again unless she goes through intensive therapy, realizes what she did was wrong and apologizes for it. 

Thanks to everyone for pushing us in the right direction as to what to do. We really appreciated all of your input and comments.


**To clarify: I’m not saying DID isn’t real, I don’t know. I think you all know what DID “fad” I’m taking about. I don’t believe in the social media DID. THE “meet the alters” and “watch me switch!” BS. and yes- she does have a TT account where she does pretend to be my daughter.**",1694117877.0,throwRAdzc,relationship_advice
My 25 F boyfriend 33 M was starting at a half naked woman and now I am jealous. What should I do?,"I am 25 F he is 33 M, we have been dating for a year. He picked me up today from work and took me to his. While we were walking towards his flat there was a woman in the balcony with only a white shirt and pants. She was on the phone and was walking around the balcony.

I looked up saw her looked for 2 seconds and kept walking. My boyfriend instead was literally starting at her and then I heard him say “hello”.

He said he knows her and met her once in the flat and she is married. And he said she waved at him. But I didn’t see her wave; the fact that he did means he was just staring.

I told him why were you staring and he said he is old and does not have time for this and she waved him.
I just think it’s so disrespectful and to make matters worst then he barely touched me afterwards but was just on his phone for 1 hour basically until I left.

I tried to cuddle him but nothing.

I am wondering whether he was indeed disrespectful or if I am just insecure and need to accept the fact that men stare.

UPDATE: I broke up with him. There was a lot of shouting and him being unbothered. I had a panic attack and he was just there. I took my stuff and left. Never to return. For context he cheated on me back In January and I think I never really got over it and never will. He said he doesn’t have to address certain things and will not so I’m out for good now. Thank you all for the encouraging comments and the comments that bounced me back to reality. Thanks :)

My (25m) Girlfriend (24f) accidentally admitted she thinks I'm small,"As the title says, last night I was searching something on my girlfriend's phone because my data wasn't working, and I saw an article open ""Blowjob tips for small penises"".

I laughed immediately and showed her what I found, and my plan was to just laugh it off since after all, the entire reason she had the tab open is to make sex better for us.

But then as I continued cooking our dinner I felt cold, almost like when you've had a drink and the world is stepping away from you.

She was completely mortified that I'd seen it and I know that she didn't mean for me to, and the entire reason it was there was a good one.

Eventually I asked the question ""Do you think I'm small then?""

With little to no hesitation she replied ""You said it yourself, you're on the smaller side.""

That felt shit to hear. I asked what her process was - did she Google ""Blowjobs for small dicks"" straight away, or did she Google ""Blowjob tips"", try them out, realise I don't have the length for them and THEN Google the other thing.

Turns out she skipped straight to ""For small dicks""

I then asked the dumbest question a man can ask - ""I take it that means I'm the smallest you've ever been with then?""

Her response was ""Yes, but the best""

That should put my mind at ease...but it just didn't. It really didn't.

I cooked for a while without really talking, then we ate and talked over dinner.

I explained what I was feeling and why I felt that way, and she listened and apologised and said she wishes she could take it back.

The kicker is...I'm 5.5"" with decent girth. I'm not small, I'm pretty bang on average. I just so happen to be over 6' tall and have a rugby player's build, I'm a grower as well so when everything is in proportion, it looks tiny compared to the rest of my body. So naturally, I've always been insecure about it.

What else is funny is that she's 5' tall, and yet she thinks my dick is small. I've always felt like it was but to have it outright confirmed as a matter of fact by your girlfriend...I feel cold, almost.

I was able to shake most of this off last night and we had a pretty good evening. Watched a film, hung out, laughed, and even had sex. But during the last bit I looked down, and rather than thinking ""she looks so good right now"", I was thinking ""she's right, it IS small"".

I know this is my insecurity to deal with, but I'm finding it difficult, hence why I'm making this post.

We got up this morning, she was out of bed before I was, and when I got up to make breakfast I couldn't bring myself to make eye contact with her, or hold proper conversation with her.

I even found myself flinching when she wanted a kiss, almost as if I didn't want to.

We talked this morning and I explained that although I thought I was over it last night, the way I feel this morning shows I'm clearly not.

I know there's no magic solution and I know everyone on here will say something along the lines of ""Get over your insecurities"" or ""leave her"", but I just feel so trapped with the thoughts in my head, and I don't know how to move forward from this.

So I'm making this post as a hail Mary, I suppose, and hoping someone out there can give me some advice on how to deal with what I'm feeling.

UPDATE:

I never thought I'd update this, but first off, thank you to everyone for the kind words and encouragement. 

We talked a fair bit and did our best to enjoy the rest of the weekend. It wasn't as good as we'd hoped, but it definitely had a few good memories made.

While I'm glad to say that I'm pretty much over my insecurities about my size, thanks to a lot of the comments and input here, therapy, and hitting the gym consistently, I'm also afraid to say that my girlfriend and I split up early February.

However, it was *completely unrelated to this incident*. It was an amicable breakup, simply due to us being in different places in life and not being the right person for each other, so although it's a shame this didn't work out as we'd hoped, we walked away on good terms.

I'm happy to report that I'm in the best place of my life, and although I'd love to find a new partner, I'm not going to spend every waking moment looking for her.

Thanks again to everyone for your kind words, I hope that anyone else who shares some of the feelings I expressed finds this comments section as helpful as I did.

My brother (36) sexually abused my daughter (now 19) when she was a child. My mother knew and did nothing.,"My daughter has recently let me know me that my brother sexually abused her multiple times over the course of 3 years - she was 8 when it started. To say that I’m feeling sick, full of guilt and heartbroken is an understatement. I’ve always been so close with my brother and I never thought he would be capable of doing this. 
 
I stand by my daughter 100%. I’m making sure she knows this. I no longer have a relationship with my brother, and it hurts, but I know it’s the right thing to do. My daughter doesn’t want to press charges. (Should I still encourage her to?)

After telling my parents about this, I come to find out my mom already knew about this years ago when my brother confided in her. According to her, my brother is remorseful and she has already forgiven him. It makes me so angry that she knew and did nothing. In my eyes, she failed me, my daughter, and her other grandchildren. 

Here is the part where this gets confusing for me. I don’t know how to proceed with this. It breaks my heart that my mom is defending a child abuser. On the other hand, I love my mom and it hurts to think about possibly cutting her out of my life. 

Is it wrong of me to still want to maintain a relationship with my mother and still be supportive of my daughter?

Update/Edit: I greatly appreciate all the comments, seriously thank you. I’ve decided to cut my mother out of my life. Unfortunately, that means my dad too, since he’s supporting her decision. As painful as it is, my daughter comes first. I’ve warned all of family with kids about my brother. I truly hope no one else was hurt. 

Fortunately, my daughters mother (my ex wife) and her side of the family have all been incredibly supportive. 

Thank you to everyone who suggested therapy - my daughter started going this week. I will look into it for myself, as well.",1595331408.0,throwRAfamissue,relationship_advice
[31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend,"I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.",1547531406.0,SnowGlobe12,relationship_advice
Fiancée (29F) cheated on her bachelorette party. I (32M) am struggling to decide the next steps.,"EDIT: Apparently my post has reached YouTube. I do not consent in any way, shape or form to this story being turned into a video.

I'm sorry if this is just a bunch of rambling. I just need a place to write down everything that has happened and hopefully get some advice on what to do next.

My fiancée (29F) and I(32M) have been together for about seven years now. We were supposed to get married next month. Before all of this happened, we had no issues with cheating, or any big fights. This is the first time anything like this has happened between us.

About two weeks ago, my fiancée approached me and asked me if I would be open to us having a bachelor's and a bachelorette party. This was something that made me really uncomfortable. Personally, I believe that these kinds of parties only serve to encourage infidelity before a couple gets married and that they aren't something I'd be interested in. I expressed that to my fiancée, but she told me that if we did have them, they'd just be friends hanging out with us celebrating our future wedding and that we wouldn't have the stereotypical ""last night of freedom"" kind of party. After talking for a bit, and establishing some boundaries, we agreed to have the parties on the same day, which happened to be this past Wednesday. When Wednesday came around, my friends came over to our place for a game of DnD that was supposed to be themed around my character getting married, while my fiancée went out with her friends for a pub-crawl.

I was having fun with my friends until about roughly three hours into our game when one of my fiancée's and I's mutual friends texted me and told me that we needed to talk. Obviously I immediately became concerned and asked her what was going on, but she said that she didn't feel comfortable discussing over text and said that she'd rather speak to me in person. This really messed me up, and for the next hour, I couldn't really focus on anything else because I kept wondering what could possibly be so important that she wanted to come over and talk to me.

By the time she arrived, my friends and I had already wrapped things up, so I was just waiting for her to come. She came in and asked for us to sit down and talk, which is when she revealed to me that my fiancée used the party as an opportunity to cheat on me. I immediately felt like Mike Tyson had punched me in the chest. This was exactly what I was afraid of when my fiancée first approached me about having these parties, and she assured me that was the furthest thing from her mind. Until then, I had no reason not to trust her, so I believed her. I felt so stupid for not seeing this coming.

I asked my friend if she was sure of what happened, and she showed me a video of my fiancée kissing some guy at a bar. Apparently this video was shared in a group chat that my fiancée and her friends were on to plan the party. I honestly don't know how I didn't break down crying when I was showed the video. I felt like I was going to throw up. There was the woman that I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with kissing another man while her friends cheered her on.

This next part is my friend's recollection of the events that led up to the cheating, so I don't have a whole lot of details.

Apparently, my fiancée's Maid of Honor spent the entire night complaining that I ""wouldn't let them have a traditional bachelorette party"" and that I was ""too controlling and jealous"". My fiancée didn't push back on any of it, and just kept drinking and having her fun. At some point, some of the women noticed that she had been getting attention from some of the men, which is when the MOH started to encourage her to flirt. My fiancée gave some weak resistance, but eventually she gave in and approached one of the guys at the bar.

This is the point where our mutual friend became uncomfortable and left the party early. But she was still in the group chat where the video was shared.

I thanked my friend for telling me what happened, and asked her to forward me the evidence, along with anything else that might end up being shared with her. After she left was when I finally broke down crying. I then texted my fiancée, telling her that I knew the wedding was off.

Just a few minutes later my phone was flooded with text messages from her and her friends. They even tried adding me to the group chat where they shared the video of her kissing the other man. She got home about thirty minutes later. She was crying when she came in and begged me not to call off the wedding. She was telling me that she was drunk and that she didn't know what came over her. She claimed that she didn't do anything other than kissing, and that she loved me. I stayed silent through all of her crying, which I think only made her more desperate. She kept saying how sorry she was, how it would never happen again, and how she would cut off all the friends that were at her party.

I told her that I didn't want to talk about what happened, and that the wedding was still off. I also told her that she could call her friends over and have the ""traditional"" party she obviously wanted so much because I was leaving. This made her even more desperate and, I kid you not, made her try to block the door to prevent me from leaving.

I just stayed silent while packing my bag, then called my sister over and asked her if I could stay with her for a couple of days.

I have now been at my sister's house for the last few days, calling friends and family to tell them that the wedding is off. I haven't told anyone other than my sister the reason. I just feel so humiliated. 

My ex has been calling and texting me every day for the past two days. My sister has been offering me support, but I just don't know what to do next. I feel so lost. Despite everything that happened, I still love her. Should I hear my fiancée out? Should I tell people the reason the wedding is off? Is there any hope for reconciliation?",1701528443.0,throwRAbrokenandlost,relationship_advice
How do I (37M) respond to my pregnant wife (34F) striking me?,"Throwaway because my wife knows about my Reddit.

I (37M) have been with my wife (34F) for 9 years. We've been married for 4. She's currently 8 months pregnant with our daughter, staying at home. I work full time, with overtime, and take care of her when I'm home, but her mother lives in our guest house and has been helping out with everything else.

I came home yesterday from work to find my wife directly in front of the door looking insanely pissed off. I asked her what was wrong, and she just grabbed me by the arm and dug her nails in (she has those long, pointy fake nails). I already have scratches from the way she's grabbing me at this point. She drags me to the bathroom and points at our cat's litterbox, which is one of those expensive litter robots. It's full and not working apparently.

She starts screaming at me about how it's my job to clean it because she's pregnant and the cat took a shit under our bed. I immediately apologized, I know it's dangerous for pregnant women to clean that stuff. I tried to calm her down by saying that I was sorry and would clean it, that I was just stressed with overtime and had forgotten. She punched me in the chest, slapped my face, and kept screaming at me that I was useless. I just stood there and didn't say anything, I was just shocked that she had hit me. After a while, she stormed into our room and locked the door. I didn't know how to respond at that point, so I deep cleaned the litter robot and slept on the couch.

I woke up today and she's acting like nothing happened. She texted me good morning while I was at work like usual. I don't know how itll be when I'm home. She never has done something like this, the worst things prior were throwing things at walls during arguments very occasionally. I don't know what to do.

Update: I called her OB basically immediately once I realized she was likely in a psychotic episode, and she agreed with me that it could be a possibility but was also very concerned for my wellbeing. She helped me lay out a safety plan and encouraged me to call the police or speak with her about going to the emergency room if I felt safe and she became a threat to herself or others again. 

When I got home, my wife was completely normal and happy. I asked if we could talk about last night and she was confused. Genuinely zero recollection of the night. I tried to explain but ended up showing her the Reddit post and letting her read the comments. She had a really bad mental breakdown (no hitting or abusive comments, just a lot of screaming and crying) and we ended up going to the hospital. She was institutionalized and is currently being evaluated. I don't know much, but I figured I'd update here because I don't really have anyone else to speak with about this. 

I know she is incredibly, incredibly apologetic. She has a history of childhood abuse and partner abuse, and hearing that she acted like that hurt her deeply. She promised she would never do something like that again and was horrified when I showed her that she had left cuts and a bruise. It's all documented for myself and my future daughter's safety, but I don't intend on telling her that because I think that would only make the present situation worse. 

Everything's kinda clicked for me now. For the past few weeks I have noticed her constantly forgetting things, acting confused, and becoming frustrated over simple tasks. She was paranoid and talking about how her mom wanted to steal the baby. She's randomly become super into spirituality and has been rambling about the due date's astrological implications. While it was a bit odd, I just thought she was being cute and quirky in the moment. I blamed too much shit on normal pregnancy hormones and emotions. Now I realize she was probably serious and struggling with mental illness. I have no reason to believe she is genuinely an abuser and I'm scared as shit for what's to come. I feel partially responsible because I impregnated her and caused all of this to happen, which is an extra layer of horrible. Anyways. That's it for now. This could all be me rationalizing abuse, like the people in the comments believe. I'm looking for a therapist.",1698791167.0,Melodic-Minute6352,relationship_advice
"The guy (29m) I'm (25f) dating and his friends ""gatekeeped"" me about my hobbies and career, I'm feeling embarrassed.","I need some help processing this. They made me question whether or not I'm actually authentic when it comes to what I'm interested in. I feel like I don't want to talk about my interests with anyone because I don't want to be pop quizzed. 


The person I'm dating (together 3 months), I'll call him 'Dan', recently invited me out to dinner to meet some of his coworkers. The first red flag was he invited everyone out to a Hooters, and said they chose that restaurant because it's close to where they work and is easy to get to. Which is true, but there are several other restaurants near by that offer better food and a better atmosphere. 


Before he invited me out to dinner, he half joked that his coworkers (all of them are male) didn't believe that he was dating a ""hot girl"" that's into the same hobbies as them. (The are hobbies that are considered to be primarily for men.) I was a little irked at that comment, but he said he was ""just joking around"" (this pretty much became the catch phrase for the men that night). When everyone arrived at the restaurant Dan and his coworkers were making comments about the girls that worked there and their physical appearances. This made me a little uncomfortable but I didn't say anything. 


Once everyone ordered their food/drink his friends started to quiz me about my interests. Many of them share the same ""male dominated"" hobbies I'm interested in, and they more or less just tried to see if I knew facts about the hobby, as opposed to asking me questions about what I like/don't like or what I'm currently doing in said hobby. For example, if my hobby was American history - one of them would ask an esoteric question like ""Oh, so you like American History? How many one dollar bills are currently in circulation? How old is the French Broad River!?"" 


I also work as a junior automation engineer at a start up software company. I haven't been writing code that long, as I was working in QA prior and learned how to code while I was in that position. I'm really green and I know I still have a lot to learn. The projects I'm working on are small and I'm getting help at work. All of his friends are senior level software engineers and were quizzing me about my work and trying to see how much I actually know. They were asking about advanced things I did not know about, and were asking me technical questions that don't even apply to my job. But, they were all smiling and laughing, and would frequently say something like ""aw we're just kidding!"" 


At one point I felt like I was at some weird interview and was taking one question at a time from each d-bag at the table. I know I stopped fake smiling at some point and just emotionlessly answered their questions. I think one of them became self aware because he just looked down at his phone for the rest of the evening, didn't ask me anything else and just looked uncomfortable. 


When they weren't asking pointed questions at me, they were talking to each other and ignoring me. I'd be interrupted if I tried to include my thoughts on the subject, or nod at me and look away to someone else. 


I should mention all of these guys were 5-10 years older than me, I'm 25, the guy I'm dating is 29, and his coworkers are in their early-mid 30s. I don't have as much experience as they do, part of me was hoping I could meet peers who could have helped guide me or answer my questions about their careers. Instead, one of them literally asked me to give him a sql query. They all kept saying they were just kidding around or just joking and laughing about it, but it was so cringey. 


Dan was sitting beside me and wasn't stopping this behavior from his coworkers. He was coaching me, I guess? Saying things like ""oh! you know this one!"" or ""come on you got this, we talked about this last week!"" Dan also made the comment of ""See, she's really smart too!"" to one of the guys at the table. 


That whole night was just awful. He was actually irritated at me because he saw my whole mood change while I was being quizzed by his friends. He said he noticed me having an ""attitude"" with his coworkers, when they were just having fun and trying to get to know me. That it was immature of me to have been to obviously annoyed and that I ""audibly sighed"" multiple times when one his friends spoke to me. 


I can't stop seeing Dan as a super cringey dude now. I thought he was acting ridiculous and seemed more like a 13 year old boy as opposed to someone who is supposed to be turning 30 in a couple of months. I'm pretty sure I can't go on with the relationship at this point. I don't think this is an overreaction on my part, if I were to break up with him. 


Is it within reason to end a relationship after this event? Everything was going fine before this happened. But now I just feel gross. The dinner happened last night and I haven't returned any of his texts today. I know ghosting is wrong, but I don't want to look at him or speak to him, the thought of him just kind of disgusts me at this point. I've never felt like someone's show poodle before. I don't know if I'll feel differently in a week or if I'm unjustified in my anger. 


tl;dr: Went out with bf and his friends. They gatekeeped me about my hobbies and careers all night. Dan encouraged this behavior. I acted as unenthusiastic show poodle and unceremoniously answered their stupid questions. Dan is mad at me for not playing along and having a bad attitude.

UPDATE: My (21M) girlfriend (20F) was raped while in the process of cheating on me. I don't know what do do from here.,"Hey everyone, sorry I've taken so long for this update and lack of replies on the previous post (You can check that out that previous post here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/iiigtd/my\_21m\_girlfriend\_20f\_was\_raped\_while\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iiigtd/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_was_raped_while_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I needed some time to sort out the situation but I did read most as many replies as I could and I appreciate all the advice and messages especially from those who had been put in similar situations as I.  I guess I should start by clearing a few things up. First off, to everyone who thought my story had holes in it, it definitely did and I'm sorry for that. At the time and even now I was missing a lot of information and was filling in holes as best I could with what I had. I also didn't want the post to get too long so I left out information that I guess would have painted a better picture of my situation. I'll try my best to include those missing details. If you're just interested in the update skip down a few paragraphs.

So details about John, he is part of Sara and I's social circle and lives quite close to us, some of the behavior from John towards Sara that made me uncomfortable throughout the course our relationship included; constantly making comments about her body, putting his arm around her every chance he could, asking her to go with him on trip to europe last summer just the two of them, poking her breasts when she's wearing tight clothing, saying things like I'm lucky I met her when I did or she would've been with him by now, etc. It's not any one thing but a cumulation of everything that made me uncomfortable with her spending a lot of time with him. She never encouraged his behavior at least when I was around but didn't actively discourage it either despite we openly talking to her about my boundaries. She just brushed it off as them knowing each other for so long and being comfortable with one another.

A few smaller details I guess were relevant I should mention. One, we are not in the US, Covid while still obviously an issue in our country our area is relatively Covid free and everyone going to the party Sara went to were part of our larger social circle. It was at a large condo a friend of ours was renting for the summer it was not some open invite party with 100+ people. Still dumb I know, there were 30-ish maybe forty people there so in hindsight yeah no one should have been at the party to begin with.. Lastly, clearing up both Sara and I's financial situation. I am lucky enough to have my parents paying for my tuition whatever scholarships didn't cover so I can focus my resources on just day to day living cost like rent, groceries etc. Sara on the other hand was pretty much thrown to the wolves after finishing highschool. Her parents like I stated in my edit are very religious and very controlling so they told Sara they were only going to pay for her schooling if she went to a local college. She refused and came to my school. She lived in residency for her first two years which was covered by financial aid, I got my apartment about a year ago and with Covid and her not wanting to go back home we decided it would be best if she moved in with me. Her finances are basically completely tied up on tuition and student loans so I offered to keep paying full rent despite her living with me full time.

**Actual Update**: Oh boy I wish I could say things have gotten more clear in the past week but honestly it's been a total clusterf\*ck and it's only gotten worse. I spent a few days at Sam's reaching out to friends trying to get a clearer picture of what happened that night before going back to talk to Sara. I got told same story multiple times, that she was the one who started flirting with John and led him upstairs. I should say right now in my first conversation with Sara confronting her she didn't explicitly say she had intended to sleep with him that night she just confirmed she took him upstairs. She was basically having panic attack throughout the entire conversation so I had a hard time pushing for clarity. So by this point in my heart I was trying to find any excuse at all for her to save our relationship but my mind was telling me that the relationship was over at least for the time being but as many of you commented despite my obviously grief in losing a 2 year relationship I decided I'd be willing to let her stay in my apartment again rent free to at least the end of October to sort out other living arrangements and support.

I called her about 3 days after staying at Sam's and told her I'm willing to listen to her side of the story but I need the complete truth about everything and she agreed so I went back to my apartment later that evening. We sat down and I asked her about what really happened that night. She started crying right away but not panicking and told she had to tell me something about herself. Sara has always been into the partying scene more than me, I've never really been comfortable around drugs and that environment in general but I went with her anyways about once a month or so. Her on the other hand would have girls' nights out and parties pretty much every weekend. Right at the beginning of our relationship I told her I'm not really comfortable being with someone that is in involved with hard drug use, my brother has a history of addiction and I've seen what it can do to somebody and the people around them. She told me that's fine since she only drinks and smokes weed occasionally. Well it turns out for about a year now she started doing harder drugs at parties when I'm not there and her ""girls' nights"" were often just her and some from our social circle  John included going to a friends apartment to do shrooms. I was shocked to say the least and I didn't even know what to think in that moment, I just tried to ask her more about what happened on the night she was assaulted and if she was intending on cheating on me that night. She comes clean and tells me she did lead John upstairs but swears she wasn't trying to sleep with him but wanted drugs. He told her it was cocaine but obviously it was not since only fentanyl and alcohol showed up in her system at the hospital. She told me he immediately started coming on to her but she tried to fight him off but eventually she was too drugged out to fight back.

After consoling her for a while I asked her what her relationship with John was really like before and if they did anything together before what happened that night. She admitted that they made out a few times before around Christmas last year but promised it didn't go any further than that. She was begging me to forgive her and that she needs me in her life. That she just was in a rebellious phase because of her upbringing. I didn't know what to believe anymore and still don't to be honest. I just was completely overwhelmed by everything, so I told her I needed to clear my head and left again. Sam was nice enough to let me stay at his place again. I talked to some of my friends she said she was doing drugs with and they confirmed, I was pretty upset at them for hiding it from me but they told me she basically forced them to keep it a secret from me. It feels like so much of my relationship was a lie, she wasn't the person I thought she was and she lied constantly for who knows how long. At this point my mind is basically made up so I call her and told her it's over but she can stay at my apartment till the end of October but only if she finds a therapist and gets help during that time.

She basically lost it during the call but my mind was made up so I just said I'd be staying at Sam's for a while and hung up. I wish that was the last of the sh\*t that happened but literally a day after that I start getting spammed with hate messages and calls from friends, relatives and people I don't even know. Turns out she's posted all over social media about how I was breaking up with her because she was raped and was kicking her out with nowhere to go in these COVID times. She also wrote that I've been emotionally abusing her after her assault, victim blaming her and stopping her from getting an therapist. I'm completely lost, I'm furious, heartbroken, I can't even describe all the emotions I felt. I called her again that night and told her she has two weeks to move out now and I don't want to hear from her again. I had to spend the past week playing damage control, trying to clear my name on social media calling friends and family. I was ostracized by co-workers though luckily my boss was on my side, I was getting doxed, death threats, my life basically fell apart. Sam thank god was completely understanding through all of this and said I could stay at his place until Sara moved out.

She's moving out on Friday but I don't want to go back to that apartment anyone. I've had to cut out friends, my reputation is now in the garbage. I lost the first and only person I've ever loved, I don't know anymore. I lowkey want to die but I'll find a therapist sooner or later. I just feel numb to everything. I don't even know if I'm right or wrong in this situation anymore.  I hope I haven't rambled on too much, I know this post is really long but thank you really for everyone who showed support in the last post, it meant a  lot.

**TLDR**: Girlfriend lied to me about the night she was raped. Turns out she was with him that night to get drugs, had being doing hard drugs behind my back for months, cheated on me with the friend that ended up assaulting her and then lied on social media about how I had been emotionally abusing despite my best effort to support her causing my life to fall apart.

**Edit**: Someone’s comment made me realize she’s was still lying to me the second time I talked to her. She changed her story about what she was drugged with and I didn’t even realize. I was not told by the hospital what she had in her system and I’m not very knowledgeable on drugs in general, all that information I had came from Sara. I don’t even know if she was drugged against her will at all at this point. God, I’m doubting everything now, this is not the person I thought she was. I don’t even care, she’s out of my life now",1599677687.0,ThrowRAdvstated1663,relationship_advice
I just discovered my (f27) husband (29m) is a pathological liar.,"When I first met my husband 3 years ago (we’ve been married 13 months) he told me that he had a masters degree and that he was currently working on a second one online. When we moved he told me that he never wrote his final paper and never finished the degree. I of course encouraged him to finish it but we stopped talking about it.

 A month ago he randomly told me that he had finished the degree and that it was hanging in his office. I was instantly suspicious.  Who gets a degree and doesn’t immediately tell their spouse or celebrate? The next day I asked him to send me a picture of his new diploma and he never responded. He later told me the cell tower was out near work. I dropped the topic and knew that I would get the chance to see his office eventually. Last week the chance arose and lo and behold there is no diploma hanging in his office. I asked him about it and he said “I never told you I had it hanging it’s probably buried under some paperwork.” He is in the military and I think they all have a big binder with all of their paperwork and documents so I grabbed that off the shelf and started flipping through it. There was only one diploma and it was for a Bachelor of Arts. There was also a paper with all his info and it also only listed the BA. He immediately told me that that was a mistake and was actually a BS and that his dad had his master’s diploma. And that that paper was outdated and that is was incredibly difficult to update things like that through HR

When we got home I asked for any proof of his most recent degree, anything, even an email would suffice. He couldn’t give me any proof. I asked for his advisors name he immediately gave a name. I looked it up and there’s no one by that name associated with the university. I asked him what he submitted his coursework through he said blackboard that university uses moodle. At this point I knew he was obviously lying and assumed he was lying about the other as well. He kept telling me he would get his transcript to show me though. 

I called the university registrars office for the most recent “degree” and they had no record of him he was never enrolled there. That evening I sat him down and told him we needed to talk about the lying. He confessed that he had not completed the degree but had enrolled there and that he did in fact have a masters from his first university. I told him I knew he was lying and that I had called the university and begged him to stop lying. I asked him again if he was telling the truth about the other masters and that if he was lying I would leave. He swore up and down he was telling the truth I even told him I was going to call that university to check. 

I called the university and was able to get a degree verification he only had the BA. That evening I told him I knew that he had lied to my face again and that I had contacted the school. He didn’t skip a beat the first words out of his mouth were “It’s actually two bachelors degrees.”…… I was baffled I had just told him I had proof of his degree and he tried to lie again! He doesn’t seem phased when presented with the truth and just tries to tell more lies. He then tried to tell me the university was wrong and it was supposed to be a BS. Never admitting to the lie just a constant spew of more lies. 

He doesn’t seem remorseful I’ve gotten a few I’m sorry’s. I asked him today if he actually believed his lies he said no that he knew they were lies and that he just wanted me to be proud of him. 

When we first started dating he tried to tell me that he was adopted. We had a long talk about it and I was confused that he’d waited until then to tell me it also came out of the blue. A few months later on his birthday I saw a text from his mom come through that read “Happy Birthday I remember when you were born and they laid you on my chest 8lbs 3oz!” I confronted him about it and he tried to say that she had given him up and then gotten him back? I know that’s not how adoptions work and he then said he remembered a lady calling him by a different name and some nonsense about his brother telling him he’s adopted. He also said his dads name wasn’t on his birth certificate. I found his birth certificate and his dads name is on it. We got in a big fight over it and it eventually just came down to him saying “I dunno that’s just what I thought.”

Aside from the lying he has no sex drive he rarely wants to sleep with me and if he does it’s only if I get on top. He rarely orgasms and just tells me it’s ok you can just stop. If I try to initiate he always shuts me down and says he’s tired or some other excuse. Worse case he’ll gaslight me and say “is that all you think about is sex?” Or “you make me feel like a piece of meat.”  This will be after going weeks without sex. 

By some chance this summer I got pregnant but ended having a miscarriage at 5 weeks. It was really early and I knew that these things happen and there was likely something wrong with the embryo. However I was feeling sad about it and hoping for some comfort from my husband. He ended up yelling at me and telling me he had four other miscarriages to deal with at work and that this is just like when we argue about the dishes. I was beyond hurt and couldn’t believe he could say such things to me. I was crying at that point and asking wtf was wrong with him. He backpedaled a bit and claimed he’d misread the situation. 

I don’t want to be married to someone  I can’t trust. And I can’t trust a word he says or trust him emotionally. I really like being married though and I see glimpses of who I fell in love with at times. I don’t think those glimpses are his true self though. I’m ready to settle down and start a family I hate to start all over and end a marriage so soon. 

I’m sorry for such a long post. Typing this out is really helping me organize my thoughts. 

Also is there anyone in the military that can confirm if a captain would have any responsibility to send out miscarriage resources to other soldiers wives? I think this is also a lie they have their own doctors for that.

So ive been dating this girl for about 2 years now (We'll call her X), we also work together. My bestfriend (Who we'll call Z). Everything was going pretty well up until a few weeks ago. They would get off work at the same time and go to another bar with mutuals to have a couple drinks. Which would then lead to them hanging out at his house without me (i work mornings, they work nights so i cant really stay out too late). I trusted him with my heart that nothing would happen, so of course i was cool with it. Couple weeks go by, X revealed to me that she had ""feelings"" for him, but promised me nothing happened between them and she will work on herself and us. Heartbroken and confused, i brushed it off as a hit to the relationship, but i wanted to push onward and let her redeem herself. Fast forward to a couple days ago, Z tells me that they had both went out a couple times a week to the bar and X had slept over on the couch a few times, and she had been trying to make a move on my bestfriend. Of course i trusted his word over hers, as i have known him for almost half of my life and weve been through alot. So today at work, one our mutual friends who is pretty close to Z revealed to me that Z and X had also traded nudes and cuddled on the couch. Z had told him out of guilt one day when he was almost blackout drunk. I approached X as i am getting ready to leave while shes getting ready to go aswell, that i cant trust her anymore, and left before i said anything i would regret. Dumbfounded and heartbroken yet again as neither X or Z had told me the truth and i had to find out from a MUTUAL friend what really went down. Im left with with NO trust left with my bestfriend and my potential Ex and i dont know where to start. Shes blowing up my phone and keeps insiting she loves me, and avidly shifts blame between her being drunk, and her being stupid, and i keep ignoring it. I dont want to talk to her or anything. I want to talk to z but i dont even know if i can talk to him, let alone look him in the eyes.   


The 2 people im supposed to trust the most in my life right now and they single-handedly destroyed that in a fraction of the time ive spent building it.   


Im incredibly lost right now and i dont even know where to start.

Update: This blew the hell up and ill try to get back to everybody, but i just want you guys to know how much this means to me. Reddit has once again prevailed as an amazing community, and i really really really want to thank you, individually. Advice i was not able to obtain at the moment has been provided by you guys. Your kind words of encouragement and support means more to me than a thousand hugs from anybody i know in person. I appreciate the fuck out of that. If i was more rich i would buy everybody a round just for taking a few moments out of your life.

*!!EDIT EDIT UPDATE EDIT AS OF JUNE 2020!!*

Yeah now that ive taken the time to heal from the situation, FUCK them. Havent spoken to my ex best friend in 3 months, and i dragged out the relationship with the ex gf for about an extra month so i could take the living fucking advantage of her before i ended it. Fast forward to today, been single for about 2 months now? And life couldnt be any awesomely better. I love each and every one of you guys :)",1583137290.0,ThrowRAJenkem,relationship_advice
FINAL UPDATE : I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party,"\*\*3rd and most likely last update. Original update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e35vj6/i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f\_possibly\_gave\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/)

I deleted the original post, but put a recap in the original update.

It's been 10 days since I received the call that ended this relationship. I'm almost back to normal, although I can't quite shake a bit of malaise. Thankfully I had a few days worth of PTO to burn while I worked past this crap. I already scheduled my 2 weeks vacation this year for the wedding, but since it's canceled I'll just spend it with the family and have a very extended Christmas with them.

Outside of a few texts from Jane to my mother when things first blew up and her mother calling the next day after I talked to Janes stepfather, I haven't heard a peep from their clan since. Janes mom tried to act as a mediator between us, but I shut that shit down and told her it's not possible. She can be a bit pushy, but thankfully she realized it wasn't wise to push this time. I finally got to talk to the bridesmaid who's husband called me. She didn't offer any more details and I didn't care to ask for any more by the time I talked to her. She just called me when she felt comfortable enough to wish me well and tell me she was sorry for what happened. She's a very nice lady and I feel bad for her because she works with quite a few of those women, and I don't envy how they are going to treat her at work. I asked her and thankfully none of them have any managerial authority over her, but it still sucks to ostracized.

As far as any of the other women, I haven't heard a thing, and my cousin has done a vanishing act. My mom took care of cancelling all the wedding invitations as she was the one who helped send them all out. I asked her to just tell everyone that Jane and I had a change of heart about getting married and decided to put things off for the time being. Frankly I'm fucking embarrassed about what happened and don't really want to be known among family and friends and people in town as that guy who's ex-fiance jacked off and possibly screwed a stripper right before their wedding. I'm sure it will eventually get around, but if I let it fade like this it will be more of a crazy rumor than confirmed fact for most people.  I really just want to walk away with as little drama as possible and move on with  my life.

I've asked my mother to text Janes mom to get the engagement ring back. Hopefully she won't give me any trouble as they were expensive and buddy of mine is willing to buy the ring set for exactly what I paid for them for his wedding in a few months. I told him he'd better not tell his girlfriend where he got them just in case she's worried my ex was wearing the ring when she was handling stripper guys joystick. I lost thousands in deposits for the venue, DJ, florist, catering, security, plane tickets, honeymoon suite, etc etc etc... I'm hoping I can recoup a little money by selling the rings.

Anyway, I've decided to stay away from LTR's for an indefinite amount of time. This experience has made me very gun shy about ""love"" and relationships and all that mess. People have sent me all kinds of of encouraging messages claiming I'll eventually find ""the one"". I'm doing my best not to be overly pessimistic, but when looking at the divorce rates and all the crazy conflicts between men and women these days, I'm starting to think the chances for *anyone* to do that are getting lower with each passing year. And I'm not the kind of guy who gets over stuff like this by running out and dating some other woman to sport hump right afterwards.

So I think I'll just stay single for now, and focus on my passions and work. Anyway, thanks to everyone who gave encouragement. If anyone else goes through something heartbreaking like this, I highly recommend you you stay with family and or close friends you have a good relationship with. I can't overstate how much this helped, especially if you are a guy. Men don't really maintain a circle of support for stuff like this, like many women do, and you can find yourself isolated and descending further into a bad place without positive reinforcement around you. I was able to lay on my childhood bed, in my childhood room, in my childhood home surrounded by good memories, having my mom come in and bring me tea and food and say sweet encouraging things about how much she loved me and how proud she was of me. I was able to shit talk with my dad and brothers to distract myself. It helped a lot.

Best of luck everyone. Thanks.",1575544362.0,ThrowRAguy1993,relationship_advice
Fiancé (30M) suggesting prenup to withhold alimony from me (28F) if we got divorced down the line. Our wedding is in 5 weeks. I don’t know what to do.,"I’ve been his support system through his entire 4 years of residency (not financially, we both took care of ourselves financially as he has an LOC and we both have salaried jobs), we’ve lived off of a tight budget and he took me on very few dates due to the debt he is in. I’ve done all of the cooking/cleaning/taking care of him and our dog while working full time since we moved in 1.5 years ago, but did a significant amount for the 2 years prior to moving in. Not that I’m keeping count, it’s just the reality that our relationship has been 80% effort from me and 20% effort for him for 4 years and I knew that would be the case going in given his work schedule right now. We agreed to not get a prenup 3 years ago since he has no substantial assets. We agreed that once I get pregnant in 2 or 3 years I would likely quit my job and become a stay at home mom. His parents (who have been actively destroying our relationship since we moved in together - we’ve gone to therapy for this) told my fiancé 6 weeks before the wedding that they are withholding their wedding contribution (half our wedding budget) unless he gets a prenup against me so I don’t get alimony if we divorced down the line. Given the vulnerable position I’d be put in as a stay at home mom without a career anymore, I feel really hurt and betrayed by the idea of this. There are reasonable laws in place for alimony without a prenup given several circumstances, so to think of the possibility that he could leave me high and dry with a newborn baby, no job, debt still to our name and zero alimony to help me get back on my feet in 3 years from now, I feel like he isn’t looking to protect me at all. It seems like a very selfish move. We never had financial insecurities and always made it work for 4 years. Never spoke of divorce or prenups. Now I hear it every day from him because he’s being a “realist”. I get it, but the circumstances of this prenup seem very alarming to me. What are your thoughts on this?

Note: it’s a long history with the in-laws but when I’ve confronted them in the recent weeks to ask why they dislike me/what I can do to apologize/how I can make things better, they have nothing other than using therapist approved boundaries I’ve created against me/us. Like not wanting my MIL coming over because she told me and my fiancé to get the fuck out of her house when he defended me for wanting silk flowers as my bouquet.. she half apologized for this 3 weeks ago but then the drama w/ her only spiralled so I don’t know how my fiancé expects me to welcome her/his dad/his bully sister into our home in the midst of all of them destroying our future (yup, one of the sisters is part of the in-law issues). My fiancé did consistently defend me during a 1.5 hr confrontational discussion, but then wedding invites went out shortly after, the family caused an uproar, we were faced with the prenup ultimatum, he said we don’t need their money, then 2 days later he was in favour of getting a prenup so I couldn’t “rinse” him of his money down the road. Again, we were always relatively on the same page with finances and future plans.

My fiancé seems to continue wanting me forgive his family and move on neutrally with them while he maintains his normal - lower contact relationship with them and I just wouldn’t come around to family functions often. I’ve forgiven them (either with a “I’m sorry but..” or no apology at all) several times and they only seem to get worse toward me and our relationship but my fiancé wants to stay relatively in denial to this reality. His mom is terminally ill so I understand why it’s a challenging position for him to be in, but by him not standing by me and defending me/not allowing his parents and sister to negatively impact our relationship/wanting to continue causally spending time with them in the midst of the lead up to what’s supposed to be our wedding, it only creates rising feelings of betrayal and resentment. 

Another note: our therapist mentioned my fiancé seems to come from an enmeshed family dynamic (I’m sure many of you probably guessed it though).

One more note: my fiancé saw this post and told me I’m withholding a fact that needs to be shared. He wants me to mention that he would split everything accumulated between the two of us while married 50/50. I figured that was a given in any marriage with or without a prenup. And given the fact that he has 2 fellowships after this year then needs another 2 years to pay off his debt, there won’t be any actual accumulations for another 5 years anyway. This leads me to feel like his family will continue harassing me full force for the next 5 years to continue trying to bully me out.

NEW update: fiancé agreed no prenup, told off his mom, and has enrolled in counselling for him/us. I made the decision to postpone the wedding and take the financial hit given it was just 4 weeks away. I know the lead-up to weddings aren’t all rainbows and butterflies, but I also know it’s not supposed to be this hard/sad. Any new advice given this update is very much so encouraged and appreciated.",1690829184.0,Glittering_River_195,relationship_advice
How do I (27F) stop feeling guilty for leaving my fiancé (42M) because he’s on a downward health spiral?,"

I (27F) am leaving my partner of two years (42M). He is a type one diabetic who has had many complications due to the disease. Despite experiencing these complications, his motivation to improve his management is still extremely low. He had a cgm and pump. He chose to stop using them. His excuse was that he switched health insurance providers and that he needed his new doctor to write a script to continue getting his supplies…it’s been a year. I think he’s had plenty of time to find a new endo to rewrite a script for his dexcom and pump. It still hasn’t happened. 

During our time together, he has been in and out of the hospital with foot infections and DKAs. I’ve rushed out of work and called ambulances countless times. Every single time, he is told that he needs to be more careful. Every single time, we come up with a plan for me to help him improve his management. I’ve offered to send him reminders to check his sugar and insulin, and at one point I kept his pills in a box so I could give them to him at the designated times. Even when we verbally agreed to one of our plans for me to support his management, he would only follow the plan for a few days before getting defensive and secretive about his sugar levels. 

I also stepped up as the primary bread maker during this time, as he was frequently out of work. In addition to helping him with his medication management, I was also in charge of most household chores that he was physically unable to do. 

He had a decent stretch for several months where he was working and doing relatively okay with his health. I was very proud of him, but I made it clear that I would not do the hospital merry go round again. There were times when I was calling ambulances multiple times in the span of a week, while still keeping up with work and running our household. I reminded him of this and set my bottom line. He expressed understanding. 

Well, the merry go round started again. There have been two episodes of DKA in the span of three weeks. Both times, he admitted to going days at a time without checking his blood sugar or taking any insulin. He also admitted to lying to me when he told me his sugar was fine whenever I asked. 

He knows exactly what is going to happen if he keeps doing this, and at this point, I believe there’s more of a mental health component. He was prescribed antidepressants and referred to therapy last time he was in the hospital. He didn’t take the pills and didn’t go to the therapy appointment. He hasn’t taken any of his pills for blood pressure, cholesterol, and anticoagulants in at least several weeks. He says that he is taking them, but when I look at the pill bottles and they’re still full from when they were picked up from the pharmacy, I know he’s lying. 

His friends and family probably think that I’m evil. I think they might be right, because I’m kicking a poor man while he’s down, but I’ve tried so hard to get him better and support him. I feel like an evil ableist piece of crap. My guilt is eating me alive. How do I allow myself to accept that I did this to protect myself and him?

Tl;dr Partner has been medically noncompliant despite many efforts from myself and his doctors to encourage him. I feel guilty for leaving because he is still ill.

UPDATE: 41M Questioning Sexuality After Making a New Friend,"Going forward I will be posting updates via my profile. If you'd like to follow me, I invite you. I will post updates as I have them until I have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


UPDATE #2 FOLLOWING MONDAY'S NOTRE DAME GAME:

Leading up to Monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download Snapchat, which I had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. I bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. He has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

Anyway, so Monday rolls around, I'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. I knew he'd have other friends there, all of which I'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. I get over there around 2. He has one friend already there and is expecting more. They trickle in and I'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. We cut up after the game, played some pool, James had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. I was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so I could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what I did. I did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. After some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

I asked James if we could talk outside. We walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""I know I kissed you the other day, and I don't know if that was something I should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and I think I may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" I was absolutely out there now. No turning back, I basically just told him I had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. He didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why I haven't brought it up before now. Obviously I told him I had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the KISS! He reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. I could come to him with whatever was on my mind and I just teared up. It wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. I gave him a hug and told him I appreciated that, we sat down and I explained to him how confused I've been these last couple weeks. How this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. I sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. He is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things I said, they were all comforting. He told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. He is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. Not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. A few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.I don't know what I would call the gut feeling I had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out WITH him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. Do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  I felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. I have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. He explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but I shouldn't be pressured. I wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. I turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. Full on made out for what seemed like ever. It was the most satisfying kiss I've ever had. This where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) I'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

By this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and I had to go. He walked me to my car and we made out a second time before I got in. He told me to get home safe and I did. I texted him to let him know I got home safe and hopped in the shower. I was so emotionally charged that I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 AM. I ended up calling out of work Tuesday. James and I have plans to hangout again this weekend. He wants to go out for food and a place called Topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, I've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. I'm really looking forward to it and I'm just taking things day to day at this point. I know where we stand and I'm happy.

Thank you for all of your support. I have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. I just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. You only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. I am learning this myself and I'm telling you, it's liberating.

I'll post any other updates here, above this one.  If anything big happens in the meantime I will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

Lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on Saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. I was very observant in our interactions, however, I didn't want to be so observant that I overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so I went with the flow and the vibes were great. We hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when I had the opportunity in conversation I mentioned that I had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and I told him that although I hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and I thought I might be curious to try it. I delivered this passively, just so not to put HIM on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. It felt like the time to make a move but I just didn't do it. We were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and I just didn't do it. It was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. Plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

Fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time I've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) We got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new NBA 2k20 demo on PS4, I'll admit I'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but I kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. At the end of the night, around 11p I went to leave, I had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. I went in for our hug, when I pulled back I kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and I laid it on him, I went right in and kissed him. It was short, I didn't use much tongue, but I pulled back and said ""I guess I can say I've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, I guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, I had one on mine AND IT WAS FIREWORKS IN MY STOMACH. I played it cool, I left and texted him when I got home that I was home safe and I thanked him again for a good time. He replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. He asked if I wanted to come over Monday night for the Notre Dame game and a cook out, I told him I'd love to and I'll bring some ribs to cook.

We have texted as normal today and I can't tell you how excited I am for Monday and to see what happens next. I know I waited awhile to update but I felt like I had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so I wanted to wait until I had more to report. I will post another update in the comment section here after Monday.

Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. I feel like I'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",1567279337.0,Thr0wthisthingaway,relationship_advice
My [31M] wife [30F] encouraging me to sleep with my boss. Am I right to think this is a MAJOR red flag?,"My wife and I have been married for 7 years. Planning on having kids in the near future. About as serious and close as a relationship can be.

Anyway, recently my boss [50's F] approached me asking if I'd be willing to have casual sex. She's the stereotype ""career woman"" (don't mean that in a derogatory way) that hasn't settled down and I think is a bit lonely. I asked her why she doesn't just visit male escorts (legal in my country) and she said that she wants to have intimate sex with someone she likes, not some stranger.

Anyway, she strongly hinted in no uncertain terms that this would be good for my career. I work at a large multi-national but haven't been promoted in a good while. She's in a very high up position and could definitely help me.

Now, needless to say, I was not ok with this given I am happily married. So I politely refuse her and move on.

I mention this to my wife, not wanting to keep secrets, and she encourages me to do it. Saying it's ""just sex"" and that it will help us a lot in the long term. She said that she doesn't care if I sleep with another woman so long as it benefits the family and we're not in love.

I am seriously doubting our relationship over this. If she thinks it's okay for me to sleep with other people for ""benefits"", then surely she thinks the same? What happens if her boss approaches her in a similar fashion? Or if someone offers her a lot of money for sex?

Am I over-reacting here? I mean, it's not like she's actually cheated on me or anything. But her general attitude seems seriously concerning to me.",1554336755.0,concernedhubhub,relationship_advice
"I fulfilled my (29F) boyfriend (32M) of 4 years fantasy, but now I feel conflicted. How do I move on?","My boyfriend is a fantastic partner and I love him so much. But he has a kink for me sleeping with other men. Initially I told him I wasn't interested in doing it and was very adamant about this for the past 3 years as it goes against my values and beliefs. In the past year I had an ex reach out who I had a good sexual relationship with and trusted. But also had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with. I would never have engaged him about something like this with anyone else who prefers monogamy like I do, but when I asked my partner if he was okay with me sleeping with ex's he was super encouraging. This made me really sad but didn't stimulate me to sleep with him. Fast forward to a very drunk night and while me and my boyfriend were sexting he suggested I message my ex. I did and we ended up setting up a meeting the next day. I went back and forth whether this was a good idea and asked my boyfriend if he was sure but received a lot of positive encouragement. I also wanted to try it out as I had a great sexual relationship with my ex and he could provide the more intimate sex that my current partner doesn't give me as easily (it's a lot of dirty talk and me having to be objectified with other men in the scenario in some way shape or form for him to get turned on). My ex and I ended up sleeping together and it was a great time, and went really well but now my brain has completely turned off my current partner. I've started to really resent this part of him that loves me being constantly objectified for his own sexual pleasure a lot and I don't know what to do. We've been doing counselling but I feel like every time we start to make progress, he brings up my 'cucking' him or sleeping with others or whatever as a joke or when we are trying to be intimate and it just turns me off now. I don't know how to move on from this experience and trust him. Before this all happened I was okay with the dirty talk, and we were planning for a future together. Now it's so hard to see a future with him with me happy but even worse a future without him. I don't know what to do.

  
Edit: I appreciate everyone's advice and for the responsiveness. I do want to make it clear, that he hasn't ever forced me to do anything. For the people who don't understand when I say my boyfriend is a fantastic partner, I mean that he is a genuinely kind person. He's very nurturing, gives me a lot of love and affection, if I'm sad he notices, he always makes a big deal of any special occasion I have, and celebrates my wins above and beyond what I see some people have in their relationships. And also, maybe I miswrote when I said objectified, but more so that he gets off on my being pleasured by other men. This is less of a me being treated like shit in his eyes, and more of a humiliation kink for him, of him being humiliated, and me ENJOYING sex with someone else. For me either way, it feels tough to swallow, but I don't want people interpreting him as some villain when he is an extremely caring and loving boyfriend.",1730958889.0,Physical_Level7416,relationship_advice
"I think I’m in an abusive relationship, everyone I’ve reached out to has encouraged me to stay or said it’s not his fault? I’m very confused.","I finally, after 8 years, have realized that I think I’m in an abusive relationship. Please see my post history for more details.

I took the first step and reached out to my mom.

She said that he’s an alcoholic and needs helps, and it’s hard to do it on your own, and I should get him into AA or treatment.

One friend I texted never responded.

Another friend I texted said that he just needed a healthier outlet for his frustration (he is constantly saying he wants to kill our dog/slit her throat—but only when she is annoying him. Other times he is loving and kind).

Is reddit biased? I posted in narccistic abuse and they all agreed it was abuse. But people in my life have never told me it’s abuse. Even in college when he would scream at me infront of others or punch holes in doors—no one said anything.

My therapist hasn’t really said anything either. When I said he yells at me he questioned how loud the yelling was.

Am I crazy? Am I making this stuff up and everyone else can see it’s actually me who is the messed up one? My family will always say things to him like “well you know how she is... I don’t know how you put up with her...”

I’m so confused? Am I going crazy? Am I just making stuff up? Do people think I’m so messed up that I deserve this? I am relatively attractive, have a good job, graduated with honors... what is it about me that makes people think this is what I deserve or the best I can get? 

When I told my therapist about what he says about our dog, he just kind of says he has anger problems.

Maybe it’s because I’ve broken up with him and said this shit before, then gone back to him? And people are just sick of it? 

I have already spent most of this relationship thinking I was the sociopath or narcissist. I felt relief but terror when I came to the conclusion I wasn’t. Now I’m just confused.

Edit: I cried first at the hard truth and now at the kindness and support.

Yes I posted on the red pill women, and was not very nice—although they are the ones that claimed abuse first and I knew if they were saying it, I couldn’t hide anymore. I think it is normal to have conflicting views. And yes he is nerdy, shy, weak. I think it is his insecurity that makes him abusive. I will not delete that post or take it down, because I won’t apologize for being completely fucked in the head at the moment or utterly confused. That was my last grasp of hope to fix this thing and I guess it was necessary to post. I did buy the surrendered wife like they told me to .... I am laughing about that now. 

I bought a twin bed several weeks ago and am staying in a separate room with my dogs. I do not think he is physically violent, I really don’t, I’ve lived with him 8 years. He doesn’t punch stuff anymore. I am applying for jobs out of state and will take my dogs with me. I decided my parents house is not supportive and I’m not going there. My dad has anger issues and my mom is a recovered alcoholic schizophrenic so... fuck that anyways. I’m thinking about just cutting everyone out of my life and starting over. I’ve never chosen the people in my life. Friends and relationships.... they’ve always just happened to me and I’ve gone along with them. I’m excited to curate my life.",1589309650.0,anonimouse721,relationship_advice
UPDATE: my bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status,"Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/go0ocs/my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Hi guys,
So I have my update here, and after mine, my boyfriend wanted to include a response from his POV. 
 
First of all, I want to say thank you so much for all of the support and well-thought out responses. The last couple of weeks were incredibly difficult and your words of encouragement helped me a lot. There was also a lot of great advice and I wish I could respond to everybody.

As for an update, my boyfriend spoke to his family first. One of the things they talked about was how I got HIV. I wanted them to know not because I vengefully wanted them to feel guilty, but because I don’t think I could let go of the resentment towards them if they didn’t understand how deeply this situation has hurt me, and that would require them to know about the trauma surrounding my status. He stood up for me and my boundaries, and explained my pain the best he could so that I didn’t have to do it and get overwhelmed.

A few days later, I spoke to my boyfriend’s sister. She apologized for telling their other sister and husband about my status. She of course was worried about my boyfriend and didn’t know what to do. I do wish she came directly to my boyfriend about it and that would have been the right thing to do, but I appreciate her apology. She let me know that I’m still welcome around her and her husband and that they won’t think of me any differently. That was a huge relief because I care a lot about his family and I was worried about being shunned. She also promised that nobody else would find out about my status from them. I assured her that I take my medication every day at the same time, get tested regularly, and do everything I’m supposed to do to stay healthy and undetectable and that her brother would be okay.

His mom is a different story, however. For a while, his mom wasn’t eating or sleeping or listening to any science about what it means to be undetectable. I haven’t spoken to her yet and have been encouraged by my boyfriend and his sister to not bother because as of right now, she has made up her mind about me as a threat. I’m pretty sure she’s convinced I’m going to kill her son one day. My boyfriend says that now, she seems to be doing better but I still haven’t been able to talk to her or go to her house and so I just feel stuck in this problem and that hurts.
His sister offered good advice, which was that any energy I would have put into trying to prove myself to her should be put into myself and loving myself. I’m still going to try, because I don’t want this burden to lie solely on my boyfriend’s shoulders, but I won’t exhaust myself to do so. She also said to not expect an apology from her because the reality is that it’s not going to happen and I need to cope with that sooner than later.

His mom did say she might change her mind if she heard from multiple doctors that I’m not a risk to him. I’ve gathered contacts from local HIV specialists, HIV education program directors, and infectious disease professors at a local university and will reach out to them when she’s ready.

My concern now is how my relationship with his mom will affect my relationship with my bf in the future. If she always views me as a threat and continues to worry herself sick, I’m worried that one day my boyfriend will feel like he needs to sacrifice the relationship for her health. Her behavior not only affects herself, but the family as well. But we’ll see how things go and if they get better as time goes on.

Another thing is, I know my boyfriend has tried his best to support me during this, but he’s not a very affectionate person and I don’t think he understands that I’m still struggling and need more reassurance than normal, even though I’ve tried telling him. It’s especially hard because I can’t go over there to see him and with quarantine, he can’t come to my home because I have roommates who of course aren’t comfortable with visitors right now. I’m worried that he’s going to change his mind about me, and I’m worried about future family events and what this whole thing means for us in the long-term. But I’m hopeful. My therapist helped me a lot with calming my nerves and coping with this whole situation. I think I’m going to start seeing her regularly again.

Also, a lot of people mentioned they didn’t realize how uneducated they are about HIV. Here are a couple resources that can help:

Lastly, I received multiple messages from other HIV positive people. With something so stigmatized, it’s nice to remember that we’re not alone. I’ll try to respond when I can. We have to remember that we are so much more than our diagnosis and we are worthy of healthy love and dignity. Please take your medication every day, even when it’s difficult. A lot of has gotten better over the decades, and treatment and people’s behavior towards us will only improve.

 
From my bf:

Hi everyone! OP's boyfriend here. First I'd like to thank you all for the comments again. We both tried to read as much as we could and hear every opinion. To be blunt - my mom is a overly protective woman who's primary joy in life is her children. I can't think of a person who would quicker volunteer to sacrifice herself to save her children. It's beyond clear to me that her behavior is wildly irrational due to my life being at ""risk"". She is my family and I love her with all my heart. My girlfriend is also someone I love with all my heart. So when these two people are at odds I tend to become even more robotic than I already am. My natural reaction is to push this all in the past, handle the action points, reassess, and eventually cross the finish line. I think it is that desire to move past this ASAP that has me disjoined with my girlfriend. I'll address her aforementioned concerns with just a sentence or two. I try to engage in follow up discussions but I deep down believe they are adverse. It's one of those things built into my personality but, like anything else, can be improved with practice. If you have any advice for me at this stage I would love to hear it.


 Edit from my bf:

- I acknowledge my mom is completely and utterly in the wrong here. Her actions were/are detestable
- My action points are attending therapy with my gf, taking a course on HIV, updating myself on the latest research, and finally to lead the initiative to educate my mom in hopes of building a bridge between them and implement ideas to more effectively go about reassuring and supporting my GF

Edit from me:

I just want to say that while I appreciate the support, I think my bf has tried his best with what he knows how to do to help me with this. He knows he has things to work on and is looking for more constructive advice on how to be a better partner. I think that willingness to learn and become better is a huge green flag that I appreciate a lot. This is a pretty unique situation that I think most people would struggle with.

I know a lot of people are suggesting he cut ties with his mom. I think I would feel so guilty if that happened, even though I know it wouldn’t be my fault. My mother and I didn’t speak for years due to her toxic behavior and it was really painful for me. I wouldn’t want that for him. In a perfect world, I would like to find a way for her to become educated and accept me. Whether that’s possible is a whole other story. But I don’t want our relationship to come at the expense of tearing his family apart.

His current plan is to educate his mom because she thinks he’s going to die of AIDS. From there, he’ll reevaluate. Whether the that’s the best course of action is still being determined due to her current unwillingness to learn. I’m okay with giving that some time given he’s willing to step up in being more comforting and reassuring to me during this stressful limbo area. He said he will try, which I believe he will.",1591038284.0,ThrowRA22299,relationship_advice
Girlfriend (20F) refuses to go to a gynecologist. How can I (23M) help/encourage her?,"Sorry, my English is not perfect.

My girlfriend and I have been together for the past 2.5 years.
We were sexually active in the beginning and after a couple of months she decided to visit a gynecologist (the one her mom recommended to her, also her first time) to get the pill. But after like 3 months of taking the pill she lost all her libido and also started experiencing pain when having sex or even just having fingers inside her. So she stopped taking it.

We have not have had sex for the past 2 years.
I have been trying to be really supportive. Giving her time, talking with her, suggesting to take her to a gynecologist. We've had that talk countless of times over the past 2 years.
But she just ignores all that and refuses to go to a gynecologist.

I really love her. She is the perfect angel I have always dreamed of.
But to be completely honest, the lack of sex frustrates me. I'm beginning to lose my confidence. I feel like the physical connection between us is fading. Sure we cuddle a lot and kiss but we don't even have these deep intimate kisses anymore. Sometimes I think she isn't attracted to me anymore.

That's the things that I haven't told her yet. I might? I don't know because I fear her reaction. I don't know how to help her.


Edit: I think I haven't made it clear enough that it's not only about the sex. I want her to visit a gynecologist because of the pain that she is experiencing. I mean, if my dick hurt every time I touched it I would be really worried and visit a doctor. The lack of physical affection is a result of all that and yes, it bugs me.",1725105205.0,KuroTenshi69,relationship_advice
Insecure GF Caught Flirting,"Throwaway for obviousness. This is gonna be a long one. 

Where to begin? Girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. Friends, coworkers, acquaintances. Even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

Fine. I love her. I understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it’s not that big of a deal even though I’ve lost sleep over it. 

Girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. One of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. While I can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. Some of these stories I’ve never heard before. Call it insecurity but I’ve never asked a woman if she’s had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. I asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she’s put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. What?

A few days roll by and she’s continued these talks with this person. We’ve had our arguments and came to an understanding of ‘if he does or says anything that crosses a line’ she will end the friendship. 

But where is the line? He’s already had her describe herself. Explain past relationships. Sex talk and favorite kinks. Taking until hours in the morning. Where is the fucking line?

I told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me I have nothing to worry about. 

Well. 

I just looked at her phone.

And while I wish I didn’t. I’m glad I can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. They’ve been flirting. The questions via text were 10x worse. And her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her S/O. 

But what’s worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that I’m being insecure and allow him to chime in that I’m creating disorder. Then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. And her saying yes. 

Not even 2 full days into 2019 and I’m about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

Username checks out. 

Do I ask for advice now or am I on the right track. I need clarity...

Thank you for making it this far. 

TLDR - Girlfriend who made me end friendships due to her insecurity ends up flirting with a guy she met 3 days ago and accusing me of being insecure about it. Her texts determined that was a lie.  Breaking up with her unless I’m overreacting.",1546437429.0,Fuck2019Already,relationship_advice
My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",1570145712.0,ThrowRafanily,relationship_advice
"UPDATE: I want to leave my girlfriend, not her daughter","I made a post awhile back about finding out my girlfriend of 6 years was cheating on me. I wanted to leave her but was conflicted because I was the main provider and loved her daughter like my own. It got deleted for some reason, I don’t know why.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/giu0w1/i_want_to_leave_my_girlfriend_not_her_daughter/

ORIGINAL POST:
I apologize in advance, this is 100% drunk stream of consciousness.

I’ve (39m) been with my girlfriend (31f) for 6 years. The first 4 were good, the last two have been on a steady decline leading up to the discovery that she’s been cheating on me with her coworker for a year. Long story short, I suspected, snooped, found out. So it goes.

The thing is I pay for everything. I have a great job that affords me the ability to not care about the cost of anything. She quit her job to be a SAHM and I pay for her daughters private school, hobbies etc. It was honestly not a big deal until I found out she was cheating on me and ridiculing me behind my back. I’m done, it’s over. The problem is what to do about her daughter.

I’ve grown really close to her daughter (Olivia). She’s 14, she’s brilliant, and honestly we’re like best friends. We talk about everything, I guide her as best I can and she’s so fucking smart it’s almost ridiculous. I want to continue to support her financially but I know her mother would throw a shit fit if she knew I wanted to pay for Olivia’s education etc and not for the perks that come from being rich.

Her mother has grown complacent with a lifestyle she wont be able to afford when I leave. I fear she will try to use Olivia to manipulate me into funding her extravagant bullshit. I don’t want Olivia to go through that.

I do want to continue to give Olivia everything she needs to grow into the woman I know she can be. I love her very much, and she astounds me with everything she does. I want to support that. My worry is that if I continue to support her, then her mother will try to extort me for additional funds for herself. She might even use Olivia as a barging chip.

Sorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m kind of a mess right now. I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m scared.

UPDATE:
Basically I wanted to say to say thank you to everyone who responded. It got more attention than I thought it ever would and people have been so supportive and kind.

After much thought I decided to appeal to my GFs better nature and have an honest conversation with her, it went surprisingly well. We agreed the relationship had run it’s course, she apologized for cheating on me and not ending it when she knew she should. It was about money...fine I knew it, I don’t have the energy to hold a grudge right now.

We’ve agreed that it was a good idea for me to fund Olivia’s schooling. I’m happy to do it and my GF is ok with a clean break.

We had “the talk” with Olivia. Her mother and I both agreed that we keep things vague, the truth isn’t pretty and won’t do anyone any good. She was angry with me and that’s ok. I’m not going to be around anymore so she needs her mom and the idea of who her mom is more than she needs me.

That’s it. I hope Olivia and I can have a relationship sometime in the future, but for now I’m removing myself from the equation.

Thanks again to everyone who gave me advice and support. It really meant the world to me to know that so many people really cared.

EDIT:

So ok wow, I didn't expect this response at all. Thank you to the majority of the people here. I've done my best to respond to the private messages etc.

There are a few things I want to address in terms of misconceptions/FAQs:

1. It's 100% my decision to pay for Olivia's schooling. I pay the school directly as I have always done and her mother doesn't control that. I'm looking at this as doing something for someone I love. Her mom might benefit from it, but she isn't any part of the reason I'm doing this.

2. I think the way we decided to tell Olivia about the break up was the right way. I've let her know that I'll always be around if she wants to see me, but things happen and it just didn't work between her mother and I. I disagree with people saying I should air the dirty laundry. It's between her mother and I and I want to keep it that way. Her dad died before she could know him, her mom has been the only parent she's ever known and i'm not willing to destroy their relationship for the sake of this truth. It's on her mom to improve herself in the future otherwise she'll just expose herself later on.

3. I'm doing alright. I meant it when I said that the response to these posts has been more than I could have ever imagined. I feel really blessed that a bunch of internet strangers take time out of their day to write me words of encouragement, support, send PMs etc. I even had a lady offer to fly out to me, make me a steak and blow me. It was probably definitely 97% a catfish, but the ego boost was nice. Point being, I really appreciate you all, thank you.

EDIT #2:

OK folks,
I think I'm gonna take my bow now, it's time for me to leave and focus on the future. Again, I really appreciate all of you taking the time to write such motivational, heartfelt, inspiring things to a complete stranger. What started as a drunken rant really turned into something special that has helped me immeasurably, I'll always be grateful for you all. Im bookmarking this so I can look at it when Im feeling down (mods please don't delete again...)
I wish the best for all of you. I might make an update in the future, but for now I'm done. I'm content in knowing I did right by myself and what I believe in. I have no regrets with how I handled things.

Its been a year and I “29 F “ am not on our house’s deed  with my husband “28 M “how do I address this with my husband ?,"UPDATE!!!!!!!!!

Here is the update I know so many of you have been waiting for! Last week I sat down with my husband and I laid out my concerns that I had regarding not being added to the deed! I did consult a family law attorney just to see if what I was told was a lie. I was very honest with him about the information I received from the attorney.  Regarding my student loans there was a concern that if a lien was ever to be put on my student loans that they could do a property lien (I’m not sure if I’m explaining that correctly) which he was unsure of at the time and was advised to just keep me off until we were married. When I asked him why he hadn’t done it yet his honest answer was that it had slipped his mind with everything going on this past year. Which there has been a lot of stuff with work and just our life in general. He apologized and stated that it was never his intention to make me feel like I was not a part of this house and that we we’re not a team.  He told me that he loved me and that he would make sure moving forward that we made all the decisions together. With that being said he made an appointment with the title group that originally did our deed at the signing to have me added to the deed. We went in yesterday together hand-in-hand and sign a new warranty deed.

In regards to his father having any influence on his decision he stated that his dad did not have any influence on his decision and he does not plan on having a marriage like his father's past marriages. He said he actually got annoyed at him saying that and had asked him to stop

I know many of you said to make sure I have my own attorney to look over whatever is being signed. I did mention this to my husband and he said he was completely fine with me having my own attorney ( who he doesn’t know)  look over paperwork to make me feel more comfortable. He stated that Reddit gave me some good advice on that regard and to always make sure to have your own attorney. I did ask him if he wanted to do a postnuptial agreement where he would keep his $50,000 if we were ever to sell the house and he completely disagreed. He stated that he believe that that money was gifted to us because his grandmother knew that we were engaged and wanted a house.

We did have a conversation about why I may have been reserved to bring up this topic to him. I did let him know that I had lied to my sister last year which he was very surprised when I told him that. I did explain to him the reasons why my sister shelters are important for me to be on the deed and he agreed.

For those of you that were encouraging divorce like I stated before I did not want to divorce my husband and I still do not want to divorce my husband. For those of you saying that because I travel for work he may be worried about infidelity. I did ask him that question and he stated that he has never once doubted me or thought that I would cheat on him while out on the assignment for work.

I want to say thank you to everyone who is encouraging me to have this open conversation with my husband it brought up a lot of emotions that we both had and it was really good to get this off my chest and be done with it. I appreciate all of the feedback.

My husband and I have been married for about a year now and last year he purchased our home before we got married. During the time that he was looking for our home he was advised not to add me onto the loan due to my student loans possibly having an effect on His ability to purchase us a decent property. At the time I totally understood how my student loan could have an effect on him purchasing a home. At the time I agreed with him and our realtor that this was the best decision and was reassured that once we were married I would be added onto the deed with no problem. Fast forward to a few months after we bought the home and had gotten married I brought up to him last summer that I thought it was time for him to add me onto the deed.  I have looked up the information at the local county clerks office and it really wasn't that expensive to do the process but he would have to be the one to do it. He told me he hadn't looked into the process yet and would make sure to get it done. Fast forward it's been over a year and some change now we've been married a year and been in the house over a year and I'm still not on the deed. This whole situation is really frustrating for me because I remember when we were looking for a property my older sisters heavily encouraged me to make sure that I was on the deed for the property which at the time (I lied to them) and told them that I was. So that they would stop asking me questions about it.

 Money is definitely not the issue so I'm wondering if the comments from his dad in the past where he encouraged him to make sure he kept saying separate is the reason why he hasn't added me to the deed. His father in the past has made comments about me being selfish for not sharing my earnings from a lawsuit when we were dating back in college as well as making sure that the house was only in his name. I do understand that his dad has been hurt in the past and his many marriages and that is a possibility to why he speaks this way/feel this way.
 We do share a joint account which the mortgage is paid out of so I do understand based on the law in the state that we live in that This is shared property due to the shared account. Please correct me if I'm wrong in the comments. I'm becoming very frustrated with the situation and I'm trying to figure out how to bring this conversation up to my husband without it becoming a fight. I have a potential job offer another state Since I travel for work and I think we should have this conversation before I decide/leave for this position. Any advice that you can give would be very helpful.

EDIT:

I've seen this question come up a couple different times so I'm just going to add an edit here for better clarification.
We have been together for five years and married for a year and two months.
Before we started looking for a home his grandmother had just sold her house and gifted him $50,000 which he could use to put as a down payment on our first home. He decided to use that money for the down payment of our home. Like stated above we were advised not to have me on the loan due to my student loan debt at the time but I was told that I should be added to the deed once we were married. We were looking for this home together as a marital asset because we were due to be married within a month and a half of purchasing the home. We literally got married one month after we got the house. In terms of the bills we do have a joint account which I contribute to on a biweekly basis and he typically contributes once a month because he only gets paid once a month. Yes he is an attorney and yes I am a therapist for our profession. I am not leaving my spouse for a job I am a travel therapist and I take contracts outside of our city and state for contract positions I have been doing this for the last 2 1/2 years. I find it very frustrating because during his time in law school I held it down and I paid majority of our bills. Also my salary when I go on contracts for three months can be equal or greater than his attorney salary which also means that I am technically contributing more to our household. We currently have two joint accounts together one on a regular brick and mortar and one which is Ally online banking. I have three separate accounts of my own that I maintain by myself. I have considered looking into buying my own property such as a duplex but like stated in other comments I have to essentially look at a lawyer to see if that would be a marital asset if I'm not gonna be added onto the deed for this home. 

Second edit

I wanted to add that once he received the $50,000 it was added into our joint Ally account which I also put money towards. So in my opinion if he pulled that $50,000 from our joint account I feel like I still put money towards it if that makes sense.",1720051238.0,WillyWonkasTherapist,relationship_advice
"UPDATE My (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. Am I being unreasonable in ending it?","Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbot23/my_29m_girlfriend_24f_cancelled_weekend_plans_to/).

&#x200B;

We spoke via text and then I called her at lunch. It escalated where I was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that I should trust her.

&#x200B;

I stated they can be friends, but I expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because I know better.

I expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

She doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200B;

I don't think she cheated. I know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. Accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

&#x200B;

She's a wonderful woman, she's just not the woman for me.

"I 30f ‘helped’ my ex’s 35m, new girlfriend 19f end her pregnancy and have now taken her in, but I am getting a lot of backlash from his ‘community’","First I would like to say, I have no jealousy or contempt for this girl. And she is a *girl* to me. A child. My ex did cheat with her but she was not aware at the time, and I extricated my self from the situation when she was made aware, with only a single message over Insta to her, that “Cheaters don’t change. If he did it to me he’ll do it to you. Let me know if you ever need to talk.” I sent that message last September. This January I receive a message that said “I don’t have anyone. He’s the worst. Are you available (paraphrased slightly.)

She came to me. She was pregnant. She stayed in the basement suite of my home, and two weeks later I helped her to end the pregnancy, and since encourage her to start therapy. She is not on speaking terms with her family at all.

We got along well enough that I wrote up a simple tenancy and she’d been staying for 500 a month since.

I am childfree, but I feel very strongly for her. In an oddly maternal way. I introduced her to my family. She’s of a similar age to my youngest sister and they get along well. Recently, I’ve helped her apply to colleges. 

The issue starts that recently ‘the ex’ found out she aborted the pregnancy. Apparently she told one of my sisters friends who is the sibling of my ex’s closest friend 🙄. He has since been harassing me on all socials. Calling me all the grotesque things that you can think of. Creating new socials to do so also. His mother called me to harass me for ending her grandchild because I’m a heartless woman who hates children, (because 
I’m childfree), and that just because I want to be a “useless” (childfree) woman, doesn’t me I need to destroy my ex’s “line”.

…yeah.

It’s effecting my work also, because recently my amazing boss retired and was replaced by a snivelling AH… who is extremely conservative, and has seen the social media post and has brought it up to me on lunch breaks. I wouldn’t be surprised if he attempts to let me go in a sideways way for it.

I’ve also noticed a few of my friends have pulled away, thinking up helping her out of spite now…And asking me why I ‘got involved’. 

I’m just tired. 

I’m not legally adept for my age, in all honesty…and I’ve been under a lot of stress and been struggling with my own mental health and this is just a lot right now. I just need some advice going forward. 

How should I broach this topic with friends, without saying to much? How do I deal with my boss (hr is crap)… 

I’m just lost…And tired. And at the moment I’m glad it’s mostly directed at me because apparently he hasn’t contacted her. And I’m worried about him contacting her, she’s finally doing well.",1695662142.0,ThrowRAolivetreee,relationship_advice
Not sure how to deal with my [37F] anti-vaxx husband [35M] since I want to get our kids vaccinated,"At first I assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  We were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

It's been 6 years. Six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

First, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

At 1 year I pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

Today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and I decided to take her to the ER.  

Thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

He said all the things I've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. He explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

I tried to explain that I agree, but I feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes I was respecting up until now.

He ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

On the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

I look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

I won't do this anymore. Although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

Can I just take them myself?  We always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

What can I say so he won't go? How can I keep this form him, or should I tell him once it's done?

Reddit I need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

Please help

Edit: for the people who are down voting::

If I was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. Help me help my children this is no different. For those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky.

My (F29) Husband(M25) Says He is Going to Disappear. What Would you do? ,"Hey guys so this is going to be a hard post for me but maybe I can get some helpful advice. My husband has been saying for the past few days that he’s planning on leaving when the time is right, taking his belongings  and changing his number. I’ve asked him multiple times if he’s being serious and he says he is and swore on God and our child. 

I feel really lost because I asked “what about our daughter? If you want to leave me that’s okay but don’t you want to see her?” And he said that he doesn’t want her in his life either. His family is living with us right now (his dad, mom and little sister) and money is pretty tight. I’ve asked him if he’s that serious can’t we just get a divorce and he said he doesn’t want to and would rather just leave us all without the hassle of divorce. 

I’m really lost here and I suggested that he speak to his therapist about what he’s feeling but he said they’re just gonna encourage him to leave. We do have a very rocky marriage (we basically have no physical affection and things can feel very tense between us) so if he wants a divorce that’s ok, but I’m just worried about our daughter more than anything. If you have any advice please let me know. Sorry for the formatting btw I’m posting this from my car before I go to work.  

Edit 1: I’ve read almost all of your replies during my lunch break, and I am going to have a long talk with him tonight. He has a history of depression and now I am worried he could be suicidal or perhaps having a mental episode. I don’t have his therapist number but I will work on trying to locate it. If he’s not then it is very likely I will be contacting a lawyer, because as some of you have pointed out why say all that just to upset me? Thank you all for your input and I will try to post another update. ",1725979915.0,Htown69420,relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.",1568146914.0,vghelpthrowaway,relationship_advice
"My (39f) partner (39m) will not allow me to take our kids overseas for a wedding, what do I do?","39f  have two older brothers who live over seas and have done so for most of my life.  Recently one of my brothers has gotten engaged and they have decided to get married in a months time.

Even though we have not seen eachother very much over the years, I love both of my brothers very much and family is very important to me so it would be so important to me to be there.

Now to the problem.  I have two children (2 & 8) with my partner and due to some serious issues he does not get along with my parents.  I intend on going overseas with my two kids and my mother for 4 days to support my brother.  My partner has said that I can go alone, pay for him to go as well or not go at all.  

Due to the issues between him and my mother, him coming is not an option, also i can barely afford to pay for the kids and my own tickets.

Not going is absolutely hurting me emotionally because this is my brother, its an important life event and i want to support him and also i was there for my eldest brother for his wedding.

Going without my kids isn't really an option either, my 2yr has only been away from me for one night, and he stayed with my parents, he also misses his uncles.  My 8yr has his heart set on going since he has never been out of the country and does not want to be left behind.

I have waited for 2 weeks for my partner to think it over, i have less than two weeks to book tickets and my family are waiting on my decision.  When i brought it up we had a massive fight and he has told me no as he is not comfortable with the kids being so far away from him (it is a 5 hour flight overseas).  He has also said that as I never provide the things he needs that are inportant to him then why should he allow me to do what is important to me (such as buy him a shed for his car and so he can do activities with his kids in). Also as he has never been overseas for a holiday before, he wants to go and he wants to be there for our kids first trip on an airplane.

I feel like im going nuts because what he is talking about is my lack of monetary support v an important family event.   Also he had asked me a few months back if I wanted to go with him overseas (to the same country as I need to go to now) for a work event, however I declined as I didn't think we could leave our children behind for so long, so saying he is uncomfortable with the distance doesn't make sense.

What do I do?  Any advice on how to navigate this?

*******Update:*****

Thank you all.

Just to clear a couple of things up.
No I wouldn't ever run with my kids and have no ever been encouraged to.  It is something I would never do.

Yes, there is a whole lot more going on, I did not skip it to be difficult it is just too much history to go over.

Yes, we have been to a relationship therapist, I currently go to my own every 2 weeks.  He is verbally abusive however just believes that is him telling his truth.  Nothing and no one will change his mind on that.

I have let him know that I will attend the event alone.  I have given him the dates and suggested that I take a few nights away before hand so that my youngest and him can have a couple of nights to get used to it before I actually leave.

He has started to message me.........

He is currently telling me that he never said I cannot take them (he did, I have messages).
He said I am running out of time to basically convince him to let them go.

********Last update******

I have since been told...
To answer some questions, so I spent an afternoon, night and morning answering whatever questions he had.  While he sat in his car in the drive outside the house for the first 2ish hours.

He has now told me I can buy the tickets but I have 5 things I have to do, most of which have to be done before I leave.  I am not sure what will happen if I don't meet his list or expectations.  For everyone's benefit none of these things in the list would increase his comfort in the kids going, checking on their safety or for those who think id run (which for the record again, I would not) prevent that from happening.

It is mostly to do with providing him with things he wants.

So, I guess I am just going to buy the tickets and hope for the best.

[update]I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance.

[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

So I took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

Before I even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. He seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

Anyway, I invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. As I say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

I told them that I would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that I will only do so through a trust. That I'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after I'm gone. That them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

Son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. I'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as I say it **seemed** genuine. He also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if I helped pay, to which I agreed (I'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

My daughter did not take it well, Christ. Far worse than I expected. Here I am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. I explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why I would leave it to them outright. Nope, not good enough for her. She doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300K+ GBP on travel was justified. Had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

So I told my daughter that as I'm retiring soon, perhaps I should experience the joys of travel also. Perhaps I should spend ""her"" inheritance that I've worked for my entire life on travel myself. She stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

Really proud of how my son's taken the news. Extremely disappointed in my daughter.

She text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. Here's the kicker though. He calls her cutie. He's told me in person that he's interested in her. He calls her cutie over text. Now, obviously I can't just outright tell her anything, Because then she'll know I caught a glance. She said I love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so I guess it's normal. I'm just trying to get some other opinions.

Edit One: Wow, thanks everyone, seriously. I talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. She was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. I told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. She agreed with me, I think. I told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""I love you"" thing. She has some extracurriculars, so I won't hear from her until around 4:45. Thanks everyone, so much. I'll let you all know what went down.

Edit Two: Nothing yet from her, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. If I don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

Edit Three: So, being 17, I have a momma to talk to. So, that's exactly what I did. I went driving with her, I've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and I both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. However, come Monday, I will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. Obviously, I won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. Thank you all for the continual support, I love you all.

Edit Four: Alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. He called me, and apologized. He didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. He said ""It may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that.

"My (31/F) husband (33/M) left me whilst I was pregnant, it’s been a year and he wants his family back. Our families are pressuring me to accept but I don’t know if I want to.","When I was 6 months pregnant my husband of 4 years (together for 10) told me he no longer loved me, and he wanted me to move out by the end of the month. I was completely blindsided and begged him to reconsider. I suggested we try therapy, but he refused and said I couldn’t change his mind. So, I moved in with my parents. 

The next few weeks were pure hell for me, and I ended up going into labor early. My parents tried to reach my husband, but he refused to answer any of their calls, so he missed the birth of our son. He came to the hospital after to see our son but refused to speak to me. This continued for a few months, he would come to see our son at my parents’ house but act like I wasn’t there the whole time.      

Then two weeks ago he started making small talk when he would come over. He eventually asked me if I was willing to get back together (we’re legally separated but not yet divorced). He claims he knew he’d made a mistake the day after I’d moved out, but his pride stopped him from asking me to come home. I told him I needed time to think about it. 

Since, he’s been really nice and attentive. It feels like I have my husband back and a part of me wants to get back together. The other part of me is worried he’ll change his mind again and throw me away as easily as he did before. I don’t think I can go through that a second time.  

He’s since informed both of our families that he wants to get back together, and they’ve started putting pressure on me to accept. His parents and siblings have text me saying they know how much he loves me, how he regretted ever hurting me and how my son deserved the chance to have a proper family. My parents have started saying they can’t support me forever and my husband will make sure my son and I are well cared for. It feels like they’re threatening to throw me out if I don’t say yes without actually saying it.

The only family member who isn’t on his side is my sister. She says that I shouldn’t make a hasty decision and I should wait to see if he’s actually remorseful. She’s offered to let me stay with her if my parents kick me out. I also contacted my old job to see if they were willing to take me back on at her encouragement and they said they could in November, so I should be able to reestablish financial independence soon.

Is it worth giving my husband a second chance? Is it possible he really regrets what he did? How do I get my family to back-off in the meantime?   



TL;DR – my husband dumped me when I was 6 months pregnant. He claims he regretted it instantly and wants to get back together. I’m not sure if I can ever trust him again.

No ryt, there's equality already
 Getting the job or not is in their hands
 Basically when companies say ""codeHers competition"" or sheskill and do only women competition or recruitment, ones competition is just with women and not 100% population, that in itself is degrading

 Him: Who's stopping women from applying on LinkedIn?
 Isn't that already equal opportunity?

Me: LinkedIn  full of ghost jobs cmon now

 Him: So same opportunity to men and women ryt?

Me: Men are already dominating the field why do men need more opportunities 

 Him: Maybe men are dominating cuz they code better?
 They have to earn their livelihood and feed their families so they work better?

Me: Lmfaooo there is a study that says women spend 90%  of what they earn on their families but men only spend 40%
Women earn their livelihoods
 This is not the 1800s🤦‍♂️

Him: The women who earn are supporting their families, rest are eating off their man's salary
 Thats why its 90%
 Its a common fact that most men support families not women
If u see by statistics, what I said makes more sense

Him: Fact is feminism in IT has no meaning and women defend it cus they get good pay easily as the bar is pretty low
 Women competing against women for 30% jobs, seriously if I was a women Id be happier and more satisfied competing with everyone and winning, not just against women
 Wont u too?
 Women take 30% due to reservation else it won't even be that much cus when it comes down to skill they don't win. And those who have skill are already in higher positions and not complaining

Me: Bold of you to assume they won't win

Him : Read the rest
 They win
 Those who win don't complain
 Ppl like my Team lead
My mom
 My sis
 Even u
 U ppl won
 Why r u complaining?
 Did u know women in IT get paid more for less work

So after this I was basically disgusted so I tried to cut off the convo and said good night and he said good night, let's continue tomorrow, it's fun....


After that I basically ghosted him and he sent a couple of sorrys for the sake of it, i said look you're being misogynistic and he said that ""U have to understand that its not misogyny to actually want equality""

Honestly at this point idk what to do. I knew him for 4 years since my first year in engineering and he was in my close circle of friends so idk how to politely tell him off. Please help me, thank you!",1719596252.0,sherliamist,relationship_advice
My girlfriend started taking money for sex,"Throwaway because she uses Reddit occasionally.

So my girlfriend and I have been together for about 1.5 years and during  the last school year we were long distance as I was studying away, and  again for this semester I am away. We would normally text every day and  Skype almost every day. 

She has informed me that she is going to see two guys she met on tinder this weekend that she calls her ""sugar daddys"". They are going to literally pay cash for her to have sex with them. Yea I understand female empowerment and women  can do what they want and blah blah, but she says she still wants to be  with me and still do the long distance thing.

I am unsure of what to do, half of the time I think that its just sex  w/e, but half of the time I just keep thinking about it and it keeps  making me very depressed.  We had discussed going into an open relationship due to the distance(she was very insistent on it) and I was a bit reluctant because I am not the most sociable person and tend to struggle when it comes to friends/hookups, but we did agree on it.

I love this girl with all my heart and she is the one I want to be  with for the rest of my life because she is so similar to me and really gives me the morale to push through and see her again. I only really have a few choices: stay with her and try to see if I can get over it; try to go on a break until I am back; or break up.

Reddit I don't know what to do, so any advice would be helpful.",1538773750.0,usingonlyonce123,relationship_advice
I(20F) caught my bf(22M) cheating with another girl(20F) ,"There is this girl my boyfriend cheated on me with, the time I already knew it I immediately made a chat with that girl. She said sorry and saying they didn't have a relationship cause the boy was just courting her yet. I have known that My boyfriend have been getting this girl at her home safe after school and they even hold hands and give Kisses on Cheeks for goodbye(if it was true that it was only the cheeks). Was that appropriate for the girl to accept that if they don't have relationship?........ Now the girl know that I am his GF she still insisted on intertaining him. I begged her to block him but they still talked and she was laughing. This was the convo on messenger because i can open the account of my bf now. 

her: She said I should block you HAHAH
her:but wait, you should buy me a drink first
    
    was that appropriate for woman empowerment?

my bf and I talked it out, and when I got his account he still managed to find ways, he texted her on tiktok not me knowing. And this girl didn't even bother to inform me that he was still flirting with her on that app. 

 The girl was saying sorry, very apologetic to me feeling sorry and all but what the heck was that. I get that she is beautiful yes but why. Was he craving attention of boys? 

her best friend even got mad on us for not leaving that girls name alone but... hello?... that girl was the one whose not freaking stopping.

My gf [26F] posted a picture in lingerie I bought her on insta and we've been fighting ever since. What should I do? [M24],"Bare with me because this has a bit of backstory. 

So this all started because I bought my gf some new lingerie because she's sexy af, our sex life is incredible and I love her very much. Random present. Anyway it arrived and she LOVED it, she wore it for like 2 days straight! It's a beautiful peice, floor length and apart from a strap around the midriff it's completely see through. I was at work when she sent me some shots of her in the lingerie, and I told her she looked AMAZING. But I also said as a joke 'just don't post it onto Instagram tho haha'
Turns out she already had.. 

BACKSTORY - first of all she's a singer songwriter, she's always trying to blow up her music career into the big leagues, it's her dream. Anyway before me and her were together she used to hang around this guy alot who's a music producer, let's call him... Douchebag. Anyway douchebag lives far away from here so she used to go to his 'studio' (bedroom) in his flat and stay their for a few days and sleep in his bed (she swears to this day nothing happened) but these two have made chemistry and ever time he says something she giggles like a school girl having a NOS overdoes. Drives me. Fucking. Mental. Anyway douchebag knows about our relationship, and she kept messaging him and laughing at his shit jokes and pinning for a time to come down to his 'studio' to work on some more music. So a couple months ago he messages her on insta coming onto her I think because he was single in lockdown and frankly a bit desperate. She finds this whole thing hilarious but gently says she doesn't want that but keeps him on her insta just incase she wants to do another music project, much to my dislike. 

BACKSTORY part 2 - so after we first got together we both slid out of the refined gym sculpted shapes we had managed to form ourselves into while living the single life, I was not that bothered but she really took it to heart and said that she wasn't happy with her body. I tried to support her but fuck me is that a touchy subject so I mainly left it because no one can possibly tell this woman what to do even if it's reminding her of her own words, that she has asked you to fucking remind her of... Anyway I racked my brains and thought why doesn't she make a page, on here maybe or wherever she wanted too and ANONYMOUSLY post pictures of her ridiculously hot body, people would like it and she'd feel good about herself and gain some self esteem! So I bought her a wig and some sexy face masks and a couple sexy outfits, set her up an account and an only fans and told her this was a safe space to express her sexuality, she was grateful for the input but declined and said she wasn't ready for that, and I stopped talking about it and thought she might come round to it in her own time. 

BACKSTORY PART 3 - so there's this girl on her insta who she used to be friends with in school, I've never met her but my gf gets anxious every time she thinks about bringing me back to Ireland to meet her friends because she'll be there and she has 'steal your mister' kinda vibes apparently. Anyway her insta is very twerky and shows a fair bit of skin and our whole relationship if we've been sat down on our phones and she saw a post of hers she'd kick off. 'theres no need for that' 'its a bit beggy' 'people shouldn't advertise themselves like that on social media' 'she shouldn't be showing that much skin it's not classy' all followed by statements like 'dont worry babe I'd never post something like that' 'i just don't think I'd ever post something like that id rather leave stuff to the imagination, it's classier' ... Judgey right? Anyway I always held my tongue about it, but I couldn't help wonder why the fuck do you follow her if you just get stressed every time she posts something? Anyway..

For all of these reasons you can understand my surprise when she posts a picture in THE SEE THROUGH FUCKING LINGERIE I BOUGHT HER on her PUBLIC INSTAGRAM WITH HER FACE IN AND NAME ON IT. so I was a bit like what the fuck? The picture itself she put on pants and put tissue paper over her nipples just so the ig police done ban her account (yes it's that revealing) anyway I told her to please take down the post as I think it disprespects our relationship and I don't want other men looking at her like that. She would kick the fuck off if sent a nude to some girl, and she's posting that picture for all her ex bf's to see, motherfucking DOUCHEBAG THAT LIKES ALL HER GODDAM POSTS and every fucking sod that puts in her four letter first name into Instagram and fancies having a wank.. anyway she kicks off saying that she didn't post it for them and changes the caption on the photo from 'game of thrones inspired blah' to some rant about female empowerment and how she is posting that for her and not anyone else (why fucking post it then) we have a huge falling out and she tells me she doesn't want people telling her what to do because she's a grown ass woman. I told her relationships are about compromise and kindly asked her to use the other platforms I had previously set her up on. She said no because thats not what she wants to do and because I'm a man I need to shut the fuck up about it. We end up in a very heated argument and I told her that she doesn't care about my feelings and I have to listen to hers every time she has one and change my behaviours accordingly. She said she doesn't care so I told her I was gonna leave her if she can't find it in herself to respect that there's two people in this relationship. I packed my bags and she called my bluff and waited on the sofa like nothing was happening. The truth is I have absolutely nowhere to go to. So she shouted me down and I eventually dropped it but not after saying that men only see one thing when they see posts like that, and they all think 'shes gagging for some' or 'she really wants it!' and that they will treat her differently because of it. She told me her followers aren't like that and left it. Since then the post has had 17 likes (totally worth it -.-) the row was long and during it she stole my weed and went out and smoked it. While she was in the garden I locked the door and kept her out their for about 15 minutes, she was very angry but it was quiet in the house while it lasted, and it gave me time to clear my head. She had left her phone in the house but she has changed the passcode on it (something she demanded we were open about with each other earlier in our relationship) this is a phone I gave her and payed for btw. When i let her back in she was MAD but we talked it out till about 5am and eventually I dropped it because I do love her. 

Anyway the next day a guy messaged her something we'll creepy about having seen her in Aldi and thought she had a nice ass, sent her a dick pic and I don't know who this guy is. She didn't tell me a name or show me the message, she just said she blocked and deleted him and reported it to the ig police. She said she was angry at men for sexualising her, and I reminded her she posted a picture in see through sex wear and expected no one to sexualise her, when she sexualised herself. She went LIVID as though I was taking this mystery dicpix side and not hers. This is a man I would happily assault btw, and if this had been real life and he'd showed her his penis infornt of me he would be missing eyeballs. Anyway said that I did say this would happen and that's why I asked you not to post it with your face and name on it, and encouraged you to POST IT ANONYMOUSLY FOR HER OWN FUCKING SAFETY LIKE I HAD MENTIONED MONTHS AGO. but fuck me. She did not want to hear that I was right and she was wrong. Anyway we had a MASSIVE argument and she left for her mums house. To go and bitch about me to her sister that hates me. 

Anyway the day she left I lost my job and we've had a couple days space, she messaged me tonight and we argued again, and I've had too much recently so I asked her to stay at her mums a few more days and she kicked off again because she will do what she wants to do and she lives here as well and she wants to come home because she finds her family tiring. I told her I lost my job and basically begged her to stay and she argued but eventually agreed. She called me 3 hours later to say she changed her mind and wants to come home tomorrow anyway but she's looking for a place to move out. 

I can't. Fucking. Handle. This. Woman. 

Don't get me wrong I am not a perfect boyfriend and I have lost my temper with her over this, but what the fuck can I do about it? I think if she moves out we're gonna break up.. maybe some women can shed some light on this for me and see if I need to do anything? Or do I need to just let her post whatever? Or do we need to break up?

How do I deal with this? I am 23F. He is 29M,"I am a 23-year-old Muslim girl and have had an on-and-off thing with a 29-year-old Hindu boy. Yes, I said ""thing"" because it is not a relationship. The last time he asked me to talk to my parents about getting married to him, I deflected. Why? Because I was too scared. He told me he loved me, so we were still in touch. After some time, I found out that he was in love with a girl he met on Tinder and was thinking about marrying her. He wanted to sext with me, so I did because I did not know he was in a relationship with that girl. One day when I was talking to him, this girl called me and introduced herself as his girlfriend, and boy, was I shocked!? I did not sleep a wink the entire night. I wanted to end it, but I did not because I was too crazy about him and too emotionally attached to him. I just couldn't tear myself away from him. I have tried a billion times, but I am just not strong enough. So fast forward, we are back together, but not in a relationship because I do not want one. He asked me to be his gf many times, but I just can't trust him to be loyal to me. I asked him if he wants to do threesome after marriage, he said that he would like to experience that, but what's a marriage without sexual exclusivity? I can't decide if I should marry him. My parents are extremely strict and would most likely disown me, hate me, and mistreat me. They are not educated. And that's the thing: I like to impose things on me. I want to marry this guy because he is living in America, and moving to America can probably help my career and escape my land of misery. No matter how much my parents try, they will never find someone who can let me live my life on my own terms. My father says that a woman is always secondary. She will always be inferior to a man, and she should accept that. At my home, submissiveness is lauded as a good quality, one that every good girl must have. Tbh, I feel suffocated. My heart is crying all the time. I can't share this with anyone. I feel that I shouldn't marry this guy because, for me, this guy represents freedom from all my ordeals at home, and I don't see our marriage working out either because we got together because we were both exploring ourselves sexually. We were fuck buddies. This is how we started. I never knew it would get so complicated, but he is good enough. Much better than any man I can hope to get from a Muslim man. They are all dominating and misogynistic, at least in my experience. I have experienced too much sexism, misogyny, and lack of respect at home to want to experience the same from another one. Yes, he may not be loyal to me, but I will at least be free. Then again, if I so much as talked to my parents about this guy, I would be worse than dead. All hell would break loose. I don't know what to do. He says he loves me a lot, but I don't know. I am leaning toward believing him. Today, I tried to commit suicide because I feel so fucking lonely. Maybe I am the problem. I shouldn't look to him to escape my troubles. But my parents are trying to get me married. Yes, an arranged marriage. Who knows what he will be like? I am deeply insecure and a bitter disappointment in my eyes. I do not want to live a life dictated by others. Is that too much to ask? I am losing my mind over here. I care about my parents too much to hurt them in any way. Yes, more than I love this guy. That said, am I not allowed to make decisions on my own? My parents, of course, will never trust my judgment. They don't understand the concept of ""freedom,"" ""women empowerment, "" etc. I have been pushed to the edge and can fall off any day now. I hate what I am feeling right now. I cry all the time. Although I love my family, I really want to escape from them. Don't get me wrong. They love me, too, but only if I do stuff they ask me to do. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. The very fact that I am sharing all of this here instead of telling this to this guy says something, doesn't it? Well, I am just too ashamed to bare my soul to him like that. Can someone please read this and tell me what I should do? I have been suffering in silence for way too long.",1691729051.0,Fun_Association4274,relationship_advice
Abusive Ex-boyfriend,"Hi. I just broke up with this guy just 15 days ago. At first, I ignored all the redflags such as, he's saying horrible things about his ex-girlfriends, telling them to me that they are worthless. Little did I know that he's going to tell me the same things while we're together. I feel so dumb for letting myself do this. 

I stayed in a relationship for like 2 years because I fear him. He also got an anxiety and depression problems and everytime i would break up with him, he would cut his wrist and send me pictures and videos of him cutting himself. He also told me things that he would suicide if i broke up with him. I didn't know what to do. He also did that to his ex-gf before me to keep the girl into the relationship. I was gaslighted and love-bombed, i was cursed at, and told that i am fucking someone else. I was told that I am such a bad woman that he is the only one that could love me as hard as he did. I was pushed that I got bruises. I was pointed a finger at right in my face while yelling and cursing at me. 

Now, I already broke up with him. But i still fear the things he could do. What if he hurt himself or do suicidal things. I would be blamed for it because people around us didn't know what I went through in his hands because first of all, I didn't tell anyone about it. I'm ashamed i didn't know how to speak and stand for myself 😞 I have always been an advocate of women empowerment, but when this abuse came right after me, i was not able to fight for myself 😞",1659456132.0,Frost_bite_me,relationship_advice
My(19f) boyfriend(21m) won’t post me.,"I know it shouldn’t be a big deal, but when I asked him why, he said his posts aren’t about his personal life and more of black empowerment. He posts solo pictures, with friends, and there’s even one where he’s with this random girl he met going out with his friends one time and she’s not even black! No one on his social media even knows he has a girlfriend, he gets comments from women flirting every time he posts (90% of his many followers are women), it’s like he’s single. Should I be worried? Why do men do this? Anyone in the same boat? Any advice would be appreciated and taken seriously!

I am killing myself inside.,"I am killing myself inside and it is getting worse each day. 

This is a story of how I developed mental health issues. I am realizing and admitting my ex girlfriend who I broke up with few weeks ago is a good girl tho. I just did not like her that much. Why did i not like her if she wasnt a good girl? Bc good or bad is not like black and white. She can be a good girl meaning she got a good heart and is not mean spirited or attention seeking and also hard working and caring for her family. But at the same time it doesnt make her less of a good girl if she snaps at me or gets mad at me because i dont wanna do certain things she asks for, or feels pressured or insecure and acts and behaves according to those insecurities and fears. She even told me about them. That does not make her less good, she just has that personality she developed over time being shy and stuff.

I did not respond to her after we broke up bc I wanted to intiate no contact but without blocking her entirely. But still I feel like ghosting her and not responding her no matter how much suffocated and manipulated I felt, truth is that she objectively is a good girl that cares for her family. I built resentment and anxiety and suffocation in the relationship and chose to not answer her, I didnt choose to block her. That means I knew maybe she would come back to ur life and u would be happy. Now I are acting like u can never forgive urself for letting her emotionally confuse you and make you feel down again. But truth is somewhere inside i had hoped she would be the one, she would be different and how i imagined her to be which is why i, with all due respect to me having felt suffocated and depressed, broke up with her finally, but still left the option open while in my mind i had made the decision to leave her but in my heart i probably still had feelings for her and wishful thinking..

Wishful thinking..

I had wished she was the one. So I left the option in my heart open. In that process I lost myself and have been drifting ever since. I dont feel like myself anymore and feel dead inside and feel nothing anynore. Nothing. I dont feel the empowerment of finally having the guts of breaking up with her bc i considered the relationship to be very toxic on my mental health. I dont feel the love anymore that i felt when i finally decided to stop texting her few weeks back. Even though i am aware that she is not the one for me because why would she be the one if my suffocation goes away once I stop having contact with her. 

And then everything confused me even more because she was giving me gifts. She was actually buying me books and stuff like that so my heart was struggling to make a decision still. In my mind i was single but in a little piece of my heart i was hoping she was the one for me.

Now i feel dull, which is an understatement. I feel absolutely drowned in my confusion, self doubt, feeling like going back on my decision by not cutting contact entirely and trying to forget her from my heart as well, at the same time i have gotten to the stage where i feel comfortable if I talk to her now and then, and feel bad for not contacting her which is the main reason why I am allowing myself to respond to her texts and even have a casual call with her.
I dont know who i am, I dont have the will to live anymore because I feel like I have lost respect for myself and just dont have a reason anymore to live. The self respect I had for myself for ending a toxic relationship from my perspective is off the table entirely and the love and respect I had for myself vanished completely. This mental state of mine directly translated to my job, my family and social life where I was just slagging on, constantly depressed and not feeling able to tell anyone since I had minus 99 confidence or didnt even have a reason to tell anybody since I didnt respect myself enough to allow myself to get help. This has been the state for a few weeks now and I am drowning deep inside a hole I feel I will never escape and become a version of myself I never wanted to become before, which is unempowered, entitled, blaming people, no self respect and driven by ego to keep his sanity, no emotions at all, thinking he is better than others to protect his ego, living in suffocation and constant depression and self doubt and thinkjng he will never fight through because why would I? I am just a piece of shit not knowing who he is and goes back on all his important decisions in life.",1656539933.0,Bubbly-Photo-8651,relationship_advice
My GF(27F) told me(33M) to cut ties with a friend,"A lot of background on my relationship:

I have a friend I have known for around 5 years, I consider him a good friend and I appreciate his friendship a lot, he is kind of the bridge to my small circle of friends . We used to chat at the office and had normal interaction. I'm a bit of an introvert and this guy helped me trying to include me and presenting new people which helped me as I have problems talking to new people unless there's someone I already know present . On the last 2/3 years we have become closer, specially because he used to frequent strip clubs and escorts (even after he married) and last year based on the advice of my phycologist I started frequenting the same places , so we became accomplices , which made our friendship ""stronger"".

Now the complicated part for me, after a few months frequenting this places with my friend, I met my current girlfriend there, yes she was a stripper/escort, we got romantically involved really quickly , she stopped working after a few months , and now she has a normal job, is finishing college and lives with me, we have been in this relationship for 9 months now and I'm seriously thinking of marrying this girl.

For obvious reason we have lied on how we met , and she is not comfortable with my friend knowing, even thought he doesn't care, but the other day I was talking to him and he told me ,he had told his wife how me and my gf really met, it really didn't bother me as his wife is a feminist and says that it is some kind of empowerment, but I didn't really like it , it felt wrong , but I said nothing , even tough this made obvious he had gone at least once with me to a strip club.

I was talking to my gf and told her i was going for bbq with my friend, but he had to ask permission to his wife as she didn't trust me because of the strip club thing as a joke, it was something funny to me, but my gf didn't see it that way and asked why my friend's wife would think like that, and i told her that  my friend's wife knew about us, she took it really bad, she didn't go crazy but she has been mad with me for 2 days and yesterday she finally told me why.

She feels i didn't ""protect"" her or ""defend"" her as i didn't argue with my friend as to why he had told his wife, i mean i tell everything to my GF so it seemed normal to me, but my GF doesn't think that way , she tells me that it is her life and it was a secret and she didn't want more people knowing, and now if we meet my friends then she will feel as if they are talking behind her back, that my friend didn't have any right to let her wife know about this.

 i told her that i dont know how to proceed and she has told me i should cut ties with my friend, because he is not trustworthy, if had really valued my friendship he wouldn't have told his wife, as doing so could endanger our relationship as she doesnt know if the wife is trustworthy.

i can see her point and it kind of makes sense, but it feels wrong, as i keep reading that that is a toxic relationship.

so i wanted to know the opinion of a third party.

"PLEASE HELP! lost in limbo, dont know what to do.","Hello everyone! This is a long one so thanks to anyone taking the time to help and read.

**please if anyone can give me insight**, and love (if i deserve it) that would help me so much.

This is my first time posting here, especially with something really personal to me. But I am feeling **very very lost** with this whole situation and wanted to see if there is anyone out there to help guide my mind and give me tips/analyze the situation from an outside point of view

***How we met***

I started this relationship with a Korean/American girl (25) and I am a white American male (28) that has been living in South Korea (Seoul) for more than 2 years. We met back in June after I was in the transition out of another previous relationship that was not working out/was not satisifed in.

We met one night when a few friends of mine last year wanted to watch a baseball game at bar, she was my friends bumble date from the night before, but there was no real connection between them. Her and I hit if off from the start that night, and it was like meeting another version of myself. Through mixed messaging from my friends green lighting it after seeing the connection, we started seeing eachother and fell in love.

***Context***

We are 10 months in the relationship, and through the relationship there have been so many intense highs with feelings of love, closeness, and openess about just about anything. We have talked about moving back to the states, living in a humble suburb, being with her golden retriever, and even having two kids.

I have also met her Korean parents who have approved so much of our relationship, and know all about her mental health struggles. She was hospitalized for mental health struggles, medicine tweaking, for two weeks in november, and tired to be there everyday and give her a new gift everyday to keep her spirits up

She opened up with me about her depression as well, and some past dark experiences where she overdosed on sleeping meds, and cut herself. This happened about a year before I met her. She has told me she struggles with Bipolar disorder, and an eating disorder, and I always brushed it off, as it never phased me, and tried to be there for her always when she was feeling low.

She was the first girl that I really opened up with about my mental health, with my own battles of depression and anxiety throughout my whole life. Through this I always felt that she loved me unconditionally no matter what highs and lows I was facing.

Before I met her, things were on a pretty even level in my life, even with transitioning out of the relationship I was in before I met her.

But through our relationship I would feel so low and anxious when things went wrong, saying sorry all the time, and really getting frusterated and down right hurtful towards myself over the fear of loosing her. I would hit myself, cry, tell myself I failed, and worry so much about what she thought of me and if she was just going to run away. This led me into strings of mental spirals both alone and in front of her.

I opened up about all of these things to her, through crying in front of her, showing emotions and being vulnerable. It really gave me a negative/self loathing mindset of how I failed in being a good man because I would get so distressed and emotional when things were at low points in the relationship (little arguements, anything that felt that it wasnt in harmony)

***Fast forward to the past month***

She got into a really severe depression. To the point where she would sleep on and off all day and it was hard for her to even get up and go to the bathroom, let alone do anything else. I was always understanding, and always tried to just be with her almost everyday, clean, walk the dog, get her flowers and ice cream, and comfort her/let her know how capable she is, try to get her on walks with me and go out locally if she was feeling up to it. I would tell her how bright the future can be, and some solutions and tips that would got me out of some dark stages in my life.

There were times she would get super defensive and mad at me for saying solutions, in which I apoligized because I've never experienced taking care of someone like this.

I was already battling some bad depression with work, COVID, and all my friends leaving the country last year, and being eager to leave with her by next year and build with her (want to move back home to the US) but kept it inside alot. So my mental tank was really full, but would always try to be there for her first.

***Two saturdays ago***

Two saturdays ago we decided we were going to go out locally, drink a bit by the river, then go out for dinner and drinks at night, which we did. It was pretty magical, when we were out, but throughout the day, inbetween events, she would get into this anger mode and just state all my wrong doings at the time and get back into her depression, in which we would fight and I would apologize, then we would be back on a even keel. We went out that night, hung out, danced, and came back, and through some flirting and joking around she mistepped and bumped into a flower bed after some joke bumping around, and got SUPER mad at me. I kept letting her know it was an accident, and she would just yell at me with whatever we were arguing about.

She screamed at me at the top of her lungs for 2 minutes, and I almost left because I didnt want to be treated like that.

She then lied in bed, and was very quiet. She then told me to check her purse in which she took all 20+ anti depressents she had in a bottle, and I rushed her to the hospital and they pumped her stomach and the parents were there.

I spent the night at her apartment alone, after being at the hospital until 3am, to be with the dog. She came back the next day a bit shaken, hungover, and so ashamed and guilty of what happened.

***The week***

I felt so confused, betrayed, and that something switched inside of me. I always wanted to be with her and understand everything, but something felt off this time.

I like to think I'm a really forgiving person, so of course I was like babe, dont worry at all, I'm so sorry this is happening and dont think too much about it. I wanted her to just be happy and feel better.

I took off work at the start of the week to be by her side in bed all day, and make sure she was fine.

That following week (last week) whenever I was either on the phone with her, by her side, it was never enough for her, there was always something I did wrong.

I started therapy and had it scheduled so I couldnt be over **last Wednesday.** I also had two days where I was sick, hurt my leg, and couldnt make the hour commute to and from, partly for physical reasons and also not wanting to bring her down more, feeling like she might need some family time.

She would constantly pick fights with me, and make me feel like a failure for being away.

I just got to the point of mental exhaustion on top of the internal things I would battle. All of these fights, led to me feeling worse and worse, and in return she was constantly expecting me to be there everyday and be this perfect care-taker.

***Last friday***

Last friday comes around and she wanted to get some champagne to feel better, in which she did and we had a chill night until she started to get quite aggresive with things. We were about to have sex and through the initial foreplay she slapped me as hard as she could accross my face, which threw me off. We had sex and the second time around, she got really distant after and told me not to touch her, I got worried and made sure she was ok, and then randomly she was fine.

We got into a random fight about the sex with no argument point, and through our depleted emotions, the fight got really bad. She was a bit drunk and went into the bathroom and tried to tie her robe tie string around the shower handle and hang herself. She has unlocked the door before she did it, and I had a bad feeling and rushed in and saw her laying there. I checked her pulse, picked her up easily and lied her in bed and made sure she was coherent and concious. She was fine, and failed to do any damage in her drunken state, and we just went to bed.

***Last saturday***

She felt guilty and ashamed again, and we still continued to argue on and off through the day. She was picking up on my mental exhaustion, which would lead to more conflict, which led to this MASSIVE fight thast night, she was stating all my wrongdoings, my patience had run out, and she accused me of only thinking about myself and not caring about her depression, and just her in general. This made me sad because I had only been able to think about her, and felt guilty with my own issues. It got to a point where I got aggresive with a pillow, yelled in my hands, and cried. This set her off and she told me to leave.

I left.

***Sunday and this week***

Felt incredibly paranoid she was going to kill herself when I was alone that night, and that fear just grew and grew.

She yelled at me all day, and we got into these fights on the phone where she just attacked me, and I was not putting up with it anymore, and stood my ground. She accused me of changing, and then tried to break up out of emotions over text.

I went back over that sunday and we talked it out, I was open with everything I was feeling and we made up and actually lied together and had a somewhat calm night, however she kept needing reassurance in everything, and could tell I was shaken and exhausted, and this led to her continuing to fire at me about how I've changed and I'm not the same loving guy she once knew.

We got into a massive fight on tuesday because of her still attacking me for everything, and we both decided to have some distance. She is going back to the hospital this week for 2 weeks starting today, and getting her medicine tweaked again.

She now wants to talk in person.

***My feelings, current state***

I am so lost

I dont know what to do, my gut is telling me to take care of my own self and enjoy the last few months here and move back home alone in the summer, or try to enjoy korea as much as possible without her.

I am just afraid ill never have a connection like this when things were so high, that I am making a big mistake breaking up with her, and feeling like I could have done more, blaming myself for so much and feeling this terrible lonliness and dread about the day to day life.

I will say I get these waves of confidence and empowerment when I do things by myself, telling myself to just relax and be with the waves of the life, even if they crash down. Sometimes get excited in thinking of the world of possibilities, but worried im too old at 28.

We are barely talking, and I have reached out to some long lost friends which is a result of focusing on her for almost a year. So these next few days I am just trying to get my mind distracted, and get out of my apartment.

We are in this limbo of taking a communciation ""break"" but also we need to talk in person.

I am lost on what to do right now.

Thank you for reading.

Much love.",1651129572.0,jsimox,relationship_advice
My (16f) english teacher is treating me worse than my other classmates because I didn’t take an elective I was interested in because she taught it,"Tl;dr: My english teacher is deliberately grading me harsher and humiliating me in class likely because I didn’t take her elective in a subject I love.

I am a high school senior and my english teacher (we can call her Dr. M) is ruining my gpa. 

Earlier this year, I refused to take an elective about the history of folklore and mythology. I am a classics student and a mythology buff so everyone thought I would take the course. The reason I didn’t is because Dr. M was teaching it. 

I had her as my teacher in sophomore year and we frequently had debates on ideological topics in class (I am a classics kid who sticks to the original myths and historical context, however we had to read the Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood and had to read Euripides’ Medea as a female empowerment play, which I heavily disagree with). I was never one of her favorite students because of this.

This is where it sort of began because every time I would make a remark or opinion, Dr. M would undermine it or just talk down to me about my thoughts with comments like “well, I guess you could make that claim”, “this is a really simple understanding of the deeper theme”, or, addressing the group, “I expect you as sophomores to be able to better recognize the true nuance of this topic”. 
The topic was Medea murdering her children.

Eventually the pressure of that class (I would hide in the restroom to avoid it) and undiagnosed severe seasonal depression caused me to attempt suicide right before midterms in December 2019.

I limped through the next semester and actually finished off the year well. This was mainly because I was on medication, the weather was changing, and after March, I only had to see Dr. M once a week on Zoom. Thankfully, my classmates became very protective of me after the December incident and would shut Dr. M down whenever she tried to do anything.

So now, I am in Dr. M’s senior english course. My mother asked me at the beginning of the year if I would be okay taking another class with her, and I said I would be, but now I’m not so sure.

I thought I would be okay but ever since I disclosed to one of my friends (who I think snitched) that Dr. M was the main reason I wasn’t taking the mythology course, she’s had it out for me. Every single day my ideas are shot down and belittled in english class. I follow all of her instructions but she still says I’m doing things wrong. Just her looking at me gives me a spike of anxiety.

I will say that I’m not the best student. I’m a very logical and practical person so doing the in-depth analysis in the class is incredibly hard for me. And as per usual, the weather’s started getting dreary and my depression is coming back because of it. I do have missing assignments and I don’t contribute the most amazing ideas to group discussions, but that doesn’t give Dr. M, a grown woman, the right to humiliate and demean a depressed and anxious teenager.

And what’s interesting is that I’m the only one in my class who is experiencing this on a daily basis. A fair amount of my fellow C students have experienced a scathing remark or two from Dr. M, but not to my level.

There are also other students she practically worships. The kids in my class who also do the mythology class always get praise from Dr. M and stellar grades. Her favorite student in the class is a girl who agrees with every single one of Dr. M’s opinions. Said girl (I’m gonna call her C)is bordering on truancy with how much class she misses (for no urgent reason). I will admit I made a somewhat snide comment about C (pretty much: “wow, she’s absent again? I’m so incredibly surprised”) because we were supposed to work on a group project that day, and she decided not to go to school. Dr. M subsequently lectured me about how it was none of my business and that I should worry about myself and my grades before I worry about C.

Still, C gets an amazing grade and thinks I “don’t get Dr. M like she does” and that I “need to start sucking up and tell Dr. M what she wants to hear”. I’m sorry but I’m not going to be sweet to someone who’s caused me a lot of pain and is holding a grudge for my valid reason not to take her elective. I was willing to give Dr. M a second chance this year, but she hasn’t changed and is still targeting me.

Ever since the attempt, I’ve become much more mindful of the limits of what I can take from people, and I think I’m hitting my limit here. I don’t want to go down that mental spiral again and end up spending Christmas in a psych ward. I know that something needs to change because I can’t take this anymore.

Unfortunately, Dr. M is the only AP english teacher at my school, so I would have to go to the regular English class. I have always been in Honors english, and I’m still smart enough for the AP class, but I’m willing to downgrade my class if it means I can get away from Dr. M.

There is no way I can ever bring this up to the administration because I know that would just make it so much worse for me and my classmates. If there is something I can say to Dr. M that would alleviate the problem, I would welcome that. However, I think she’s not someone I can reason with. 

I really just wish she would leave me alone.",1638509528.0,throwaway_account_xa,relationship_advice
How can I (20F) educate my sister (13F) about sex and sexuality?,"As a kid and a teen, I never received any kind of sex education from school or my family.  Everything I ""knew"" about sex as a pre-teen, I learned from my peers at school, the internet and porn. Needless to say, that placed me in all sorts of embarrassing, unnecessary and stupid situations.

As young as 11 years old, I learned sex is essentially when a woman spreads her legs and lets a man in to give him pleasure; that a woman's value is in how cool, chill and hot she is; and started seeking for male validation, displaying inappropriate sexual behaviour for my age and throwing my female classmates under the bus if that would get me male attention.

It didn't help that my family is conservative, my dad has sexist ideas and I was raised a Christian (in the traditional, restrictive sense). My parents, at home, would reward me with attention when I would laugh at sexist jokes, much like my classmates at school. I learned being ""chill"" would make me seem fun and earn me friends. So I had a lot of wrong ideas about sex, sexuality and what it means to be a woman

At home, I was a polite, sweet little girl my family was proud of. At school, I would make dirty jokes. I would cuss. I would draw explicit stuff. I would talk about my body to boys. I would make sexist jokes to get on the boys' good side. I thought I was ""one of the guys"". Except the guys were mean to me and didn't treat me like a friend. They knew what I felt and were taking advantage of it. They blackmailed me once using a personal secret I'd told them and it was distressing. Yet I continued seeking for their attention. I was just too young and uneducated to see what was going on. Thankfully I never did anything physical with them, or else I would've regretted it immensely. I changed schools later, and being in a new environment with different people kept me at bay.

A few years later, when I was around 14, I found feminism through social media and started reading about it. I learned what healthy sex and positive sexuality look like. I learned I don't need male attention to feel like a lovable person. I learned my body is wonderful the way it is. I learned sex is not something a woman gives to a man, but rather something two people, regardless of gender, can share equally. I learned about my menstrual cycle and how my body works in ways nobody had ever told me before.

I had to tear down all my warped ideas about sex, being a woman and sexuality. My body image changed. I was going down a dangerous road as a pre-teen, but feminism turned my life around and helped me grow into a healthy, empowered adult. Still, I get deeply ashamed when I remember what I was like and the things I would do for male attention when I was younger.

My sister is 13 years old and, as her big sister, I want to make sure she doesn't have to go through what I went through. She's really similar to what I was like at her age. Shy, sweet, smart, nerdy, a little insecure, feels like she doesn't fit in. I know at her age she has likely heard and seen a lot of things she might not understand. Maybe her classmates talk about it like mines used to back then.

Either way, I don't want her to be in the dark and do and say things she doesn't even understand because she feels pressured, like I used to. Don't get me wrong, I know she will make her own experiments with sexuality just like I did, but I want her to be informed so those can be healthy and positive experiences. Education is the key to empowerment and protection, and I want to empower and protect her as much as I can.

She's the person I love the most in the world. We have a great relationship and can talk openly about all sorts of things. She started menstruating this year and I've already explained all about her cycle, why it exists and the different menstrual hygiene products including the cup, period panties etc. their pros and cons, and helped her pick one that better suited her. It was really nice to be able to do something for her nobody had done for me.

At school she learned about the biology of conception, reproductive system and genitals. But, like me, she has received no sex education at home or at school. So I feel the need to step up and do it. The other day I showed her both an external and an internal condom and asked if she knew what they are, she said no and genuinely seemed not to know. It seems there's a lot she doesn't know. Even less than I did at her age.

I'd been waiting for her to come up to me and ask, but I realised when I was her age I'd never ask my parents, and now I believe I should take the first step. My parents won't do it and I know they won't mind if I do. She has been expressing frustration at not being able to watch certain types of content with me and being excluded from conversations I have with my mom, and I think it's time to let her learn.

So Reddit, considering my history, my relationship with my sister and her age, how can I educate her about sex without making her uncomfortable?

TL;DR: How can I, a woman who went through a lot of trouble and embarrassment as a kid for lack of sex education, educate my sister to protect her from sexism and insecurity?",1601489477.0,holdnarrytight,relationship_advice
Fear of being cheated on stops me from getting into relationships,"I absolutely despise people who cheat when in a relationship. 



I just saw the Sex/Life show on Netflix. I couldn't help but feel for Cooper. I get that the Billie the main character doesn't want to supress her true self anymore, but does empowerment have to end up in cheating?

People can be in a poly relationship. People can have wild sex life and still be a good mom. But does it all have to be at the cost of hurting others? If you want good sex and don't want to hurt your significant other, then talk to them or break up. 

I am in kinda a similar situation. I have this amazing connection with a girl, hoping to date her soon. She is well connected with her ex who is a classic bad boy. I am tall, athletic and have good job and always felt good about myself. But after the show I have so many insecurities popping up. 

How do I know for sure that if I am able to date that girl (or marry, 🤞) she will not go back to her ex? How do I not doubt everything she does?

SO(F23) toxic family ruining our relationship after 3 years of nothing but respect and love from myself (M26),"Her father is mentally abusive to their entire family and everyone succumbs to it. And was rough with his kids to the point to where protective services were involved twice. I have been the upmost respectful and nice to her entire family, offering to pay for food, doing the dishes(even though he thinks it’s a women’s job) walking the dog, going to her younger brothers football games because he asked me to go watch him play, ive cooked for them, take care of their fish tank, fixed the gutters, fixed holes in the wall.. never once have I gotten a thank you. Though I did get a “family meeting” where he told everyone I hurt his manhood because he is supposed to be doing that stuff.. he has tried putting me against her by telling me she’s crazy and tried to get her to leave me by telling her I’m nothing special. I got them all Christmas gifts this Christmas other than her older brother(24) and younger brother(15). So on top of that stuff he hides money from the family losing it in gambling, putting thousands into money bowls, and who knows what’s else. Heat gets turned off, electricity, cable, my gf has had to give them money on multiple occasions. Even after her father maxed out her credit card and crashed her credit score when she lost her job how ever long ago before me.. her mother is religious(doesn’t believe it’s okay to be gay or anything else other than straight, and is completely enveloped in her husbands bull and won’t speak up unless it’s in private(so either she’s lying to us or lying to him) and her brother is the kind of frat bro that thinks it’s cool to lie as long as it makes him look good, cheat on his girlfriend, break up with her to cheat on her and then tell people it’s scummy being that kind of person like I don’t know he’s doing that stuff.. talks about running over BLM protesters like it’s a new fad and wants to blow any left person with a gun if they try to take his gun he owns against his families wishes... again everyone ignores all of this.. I ignore all of this and with a smile and open heart I take them as they are. Go over every weekend, chill with her little brother, play cod with her older brother, help her mom with shopping, holiday decorating, try talking to her dad and talk shop when he isn’t trying to convince me to get into one of his get rich quick schemes or pyramid schemes.. on New Year’s Day we had an amazing day.. their aunt and uncle were over to which I feel like they liked me as I actually got a gift of 100$ from them to which I tried to give back.. so her older brother and gf are fighting over a movie because he can’t fathom how she liked it and that it had to do with female empowerment or something like that.. somehow she is the exact opposite of him.. well she tried to leave and he trapped her in his doorway essentially cornering her.. she asked t one let out several times as we heard from the room adjacent.. the asking turned to pleading his talking turning to yelling. Her pleading turned to screaming to be let out and from there sobbing crying to be let out so my gf with my approval(not that it matters at all but she looked at me for approval to get the door open and i was like YES LIKE NOW.) so she does he’s red In The face and she’s runs out tears streaming down her face.. he then starts freaking out and gets in my SOs face and so I told him he needs to chill out, he then proceeded to tell me to shut up so I called him something that you can call a cat and the female anatomy and he didn’t like that.. tried getting threw his mother and then his sister who shoulder checked him back into his room and then I needed to pull her back and then her dad came up and told everyone to fuck off. 
Fast forward to the past Sunday  I have spoken to everyone other than her brother as of that moment and before leaving her father and son are fighting and our argument comes to face and he says that it’s over and done with, be a man and shake hands. So he comes over and I don’t shake his hand. 

And I’m not going to shake someone’s hand I do not like, love, appreciate, respect or even forgive for acting consistently like a shitty person. 

Their dad flips a shit after just taking about how their household is now going to be dry of alcohol, politics, and yelling. Starts screaming at me to be a man and I told him that I am being a man and not being complacent to someone who I don’t forgive for doing something I don’t this is okay. And so I got kicked out of the house if I didn’t shake his hand and so me and him went outside, we spoke. He made up excuses, tried to derail, lied to my face about past issues, told me “I don’t expect you to kiss my feet” as my reply was “I would never” I told him I don’t like him, I think he acting like an abusive man child, I would never be friends with him and that he’s a constant liar and bad person. I told him the most respect I would ever give him would be as my SOs older brother. And caved in hopes to just end this for the sake of her sanity to which I probably already made worse.. so since then I haven’t been to the house a few times but waited outside like I did the first week we met to pick her up for our dates. I’m not looked at or spoken to, her mother Unfriended me on Facebook lol, and everyone is blaming me and her instead.. 
I’m at a loss as to what to do. I did really care about her mother and I loved them like family as well as her little brother and her cousins which weren’t involved and have mentioned publicly they are on my side on this and that led to my gf being deemed out by her mother father and brother for being a POS and not having any “family allegiance”.. she’s called me sobbing tonight and I had to keep my cool.. I am not a confrontational person.. I stick to myself, have had people try to fight me and I have never thrown a punch in my life other than to my little brother in a spat a few years ago. I’m an introverted animal lover who keeps exotic pets, do skeletal articulations, starting my own aquarium maintenance company. I’ve had my issues,deal with depression and anxiety.. I’m just lost. I feel shunned by people I never really thought I’d care to be shunned by.. I feel strongly i have done nothing wrong. Even with my outburst I feel it was LONG overdue.. and the “man” in me will not let me apologize to someone for them being an emotionally abusive human being. I love my gf.. I would help pay her bills, I’d move in with her and honestly marry the girl. I think she’s amazing.. I’m trying to keep my cool for her sake.. but I feel like after 16 years of pent up depression, anxiety, anger, abuse and being walked over and on I’m done with it, feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place.. any advice would be helpful starting to miss the pretending and fake smiles and I know I shouldn’t cave 😔",1610775818.0,Serrasalmuslife42,relationship_advice
I love my boyfriend but I keep feeling that I should break up with him because I feel that I won’t be able to change,"Okay so first things first I love my boyfriend he is by far the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. He’s sweet, romantic, cheesy as hell and I love that we have the best conversations ever! Legit we can talk about anything and if anything he got me into reddit. 


Some history: my past is rather bad because I had relationship with relationship guy that broke up with me in a months times. They would always tell
Me “your to perfect” or “you deserve better” and this would normally happen the smallest inconvenience happen to them. I would give those relationships my all and honestly they treated me like shit. And trust me I’ve been around the block a few times and I tried many many things. I told all this to my boyfriend before we got together and he has never treated me any different. 

So about a couple months ago I got a message from an old flam and he told me “hey you were right, my girlfriend and I broke up” 

About 6 months before I met my boyfriend and I meant this guy (24) at the time. he had a girlfriend and they didn’t have sex at all and at the time I was just so over men that I settled for anything. So this guy and I had an affair. He had been with his girlfriend for about 2 years before he started cheating on her with me. Don’t get me wrong the sex was amazing and I couldn’t believe a guy like him would ever settle for a girl like her (don’t get me wrong I’m all about woman empowerment but from the beginning this guy new she still had her V-card and she was going
To give it up until marriage) from then on out him and I had an affair for about 2 months and I fell deeply in love with him. I thought I could change him and I kept telling him “break up with her because if she finds out she will get hurt” she nerve did fine out but karma bit him in the ass because she ended up cheating on him. 

So when the guy told me he had broken up with his girlfriend I was about 2 months in with my boyfriend and I low key wanted to run to the other guy and break up with my boyfriend because this is what I low key wanted for the Time well having an affair with him.  After all that I felt deep shame and I hit a stage of depression and anxiety and I felt so insecure about my relationship with my amazing boyfriend. I ended up talking to him about it because like I said we have amazing conversation and we can really talk about anything. He wasn’t upset or bothered but he was worried that we where going to break up and I knew that I didn’t want that but i also didn’t really know what I wanted at the time. I told myself that what I was feeling was just a phase and that it will pass and it did... if anything I got better and I love my boyfriend more then ever, we have amazing sex, he always makes me feel special and I just can’t get enough of him though there comes a time when I start acting super bitchy with him and I start nitpicking at what he is say when he is talking to others and in my past relationship I would never do that. Also lately I’ve been thinking about the other guy and I feel like a shity girlfriend because I know it wrong of me and I’m scared that one day my Curiosity will get the best of me and I’ll cheat on my boyfriend with the other guy .... as they say history repeats its self. What I’m also scared about is if I’ll change as a person completely. Like nitpicking at my boyfriend is that something that I’ll keep on doing? I’m scared I won’t change my old ways of being. I don’t  want to do anything with anyone else if anything I just want to go back to the way I was. I guess what I’m asking for is. 

How do you over come those types of fears? 
Should I tell my boyfriend? 
Am I going back to old habits? 
Am I a bad girlfriend? 
Please help me. 


Also I’m seeking therapy and taking medicine to get over my depression and anxiety. So I don’t know if this is also a side affects of the meds as well but I’m hopping it not because I can’t stop taking them anytime soon.

How to be friends with females,Hi female here. I have a problem I have a hard time making female friends. I think it stemmed from getting betrayed by a friend I never thought would do me wrong as she preached like a fucking priest about girl empowerment and fuck boys. She tried to get with my ex behind my back. I had no clue even if i thought it was weird that every time my ex posted  she would always comment but her being my friend I would like her comment and move on because I didn’t think she was trifling but of course her ass was. I really miss her as a friend but I know I wouldn’t be able to trust her and if you can’t trust your friends around your man then I guess you shouldn’t be friends? Not sure anyways I have problems making female friends even at work. The only people who ever talk to me are men not females. Like I won’t lie it feels good to have someone to talk to but I got a jelly bf and I wouldn’t want to upset him only having male friends. So I keep it short and simple. Only work related. I’ve tried talking to my supervisor who is close my age we exchanged numbers but it feels more like a co worker situation then a friendship if you know what I mean. I mean I have my bf but my bf has his friends and stuff and that’s nice and all but I want my own friends. But it seems like no female wants to be friends. I find myself just being anxious.

My (F20) best friend (F19) hates her body,"My best friend is anemic and can’t gain weight. She also had a four wheeler accident when she was 14 that almost resulted in the amputation of her leg. She came out with a pretty gnarly scar because of it that she absolutely hates.

She works as a graphic designer with her aunt (who is an ass) and Friday she drew this pic of her and her husband. Her aunt commented on how her thighs are not bigger than her calves and she shouldn’t have drawn them that way, and then laughed at her. 

Anyways, we took some milk bath photos with a friend (D) that night because female empowerment and body positivity. I think that everyone came out of it feeling shitty though. I’m about 150, trying to loose weight and not being able to. And D and BF are both pretty small. So it was just me comparing myself to them and them comparing themselves to me.. I’m not 100% sure if that’s the case but I know that’s how I feel.. and I have a strong feeling that’s how BF feels.. 

This morning I woke up to a snapchat of her crying and showing me a new drawing she did, which was a pic of her with an instagram body... I’m scared of saying something to set her off. When she’s depressed she can snap pretty fast... I just don’t wanna say the wrong thing. The last thing I said was “beauty doesn’t come from looking a certain way it comes from accepting your “flaws” and being proud of the body you’re born into” and she said “i’ll KMS before I accept myself” and I deadass don’t know how to respond... I’ve been saving pics of skinny girls with huge followings and all positive comments from insta, and then I was gonna show her a clip of Mean Girls where the whole cafeteria makes fun of how big Regina George’s tiny ass is, and how society changes.. 

Idk, if you’re reading this and you’re as stumped as I am, just know that skinny girls are made fun of quite a lot.. and it’s just the same as getting called fat or ugly to call someone a “beanstalk” or a “toothpick”.. People don’t realize this and I’ve watched a ton of people openly say that to her, but those people would never openly comment on how big a woman is either so..",1579540863.0,duruxi,relationship_advice
Thinking Rebound?,"Let me tell you...I came out of a 10 year relationship last year, made a POF account after 4 months, met a GREAT guy (clingy) but at that time, I needed the constant attention. (So, I thought I did.) Ex wanted to work it out, so of course, I ran back! Only to be left at square one in 2 weeks. Mind you, I had deleted that POF account. This time, it only took me a week to make another one! So, here I go again, looking for a rebound. *eye roll* I found ANOTHER great guy. Except, this time, I was already on a mission to regaining my strength and hope of a greater future for myself. This new guy, was getting serious, and honestly... I just wasn't at his level. He wanted more of me than I was willing to give. Although, he said he would be patient with me, I just couldn't do it anymore. I realized I was doing more harm than good because I knew he wasn't THE ONE for me. I broke it off the day before Valentine's Day because I just didn't want to fake it anymore. Ever since, I've been 100% DOING ME. I don't know how to explain it, but I am finally okay being me. I am finally able to sleep at night knowing it's just me. I am finally at peace knowing me and my ex will never be. I am finally falling in love with myself, slowly loving all my broken pieces back together again. I just know that I know that someone, THAT ONE....will find me. I'll be here.

"Don't want to push her away more, but I have more to say - 38/M (me) 28F (her)","I've been dating a girl from work for the last 4.5 months.  It was the first time I ever crossed that line, but I had to explore it there was just too much chemistry to ignore.  It almost got sabotaged by a jealous person in the office who filed a false HR complaint against me claiming I was harassing the girl I liked.  I didn't know who to trust after that happened and we didn't talk for two months before the silence was broken and our real feelings were expressed.

For a big portion of it I tried to pace things because we worked on the same team 10ft away from each other.   I sometimes worried what would happen if things went south.   I finally switched to a different department by July, we were taking all of our breaks/lunches together and she stayed over once a weekend ..... but by that time she was already getting antsy about spending more time together - something I ultimately failed to do.

A couple of Fridays ago after more late responses to my texts - it finally hit me that she had been pulling away.  I texted back ""I get it"" and she hit me with it - she felt a certain way now because of all the time she spent trying to hang out more to progress and I didn't reciprocate.   A big text battle ensued, one which I regret big time and basically our first ever big blow up.  I pointed fingers instead of owning where I messed up.  I pushed it in the extreme direction by saying ""it's done"".  She got mad claiming that I was ""shutting down  again""  but would go on to say I'm an amazing guy and we have great times together, except right now it's best if we take some space.

Strangely enough she decided to roll over to her sister's desk (which is right in front of mine) to talk to her on both Monday and Tuesday last week.   Both times I texted afterwards and it really seemed like we were getting back on track with some of the dialogue.   I told her I was spending time reflecting and feeling the weight of what happened.  She said she understood and was doing the same but still had some things she wasn't sure of.  I was also surprised to hear her say that it wasn't all negative and she was glad we talked.   I then tried to lighten the mood by showing her the new Post Malone album, which she's been posting on Instagram all week.

Tuesday specifically was interesting because we were really back in the groove to the point where she wanted to sit together at lunch.   No more than five minutes later she told me she couldn't make it.  I said no problem - just let me know my schedule is open.   Then she hit me with it - she was finally going to sign the divorce papers.  This was a guy that altogether she was with for 9 years - he also had a drug problem.   I played it cool and told her I'm happy she was finally doing it.   She said she was looking forward to it being over but that she feels ""a certain way"" about all of it.

Just as she promised - she messaged me when she got back, said she was relieved, and that it didn't go as bad as she thought it would.   The well has since gone dry.   All contact has been extremely light, only every couple of days - she responds but it's all initiated by me.  She does always watch my IG videos though (not that it means much).  I did manage to see her otw to the bathroom.  She was in a booth in the area, so I just smiled real wide and walked up to her to give her a playful high five.   She complimented me on my new shirt and asked ""if it was lavendar scented"", which was something she used to do when she would flirt with me and lean in to smell my cologne.

I'm trying not to overanalyze the ""divorce"", but my Spidey-sense is going off.   I don't know whether she pulled away again because of latent feelings for him - let's be honest our 4.5 months is nothing compared to their 8-9 years.   Or was it she felt a new empowerment for finally closing that chapter and there I am just some stubborn knucklehead who picked a fight with her on the eve of her closing that chapter.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.   I miss her every day and it's tough to swallow.  Granted I did have some valid concerns (that I never voiced), but I want to apologize for my stubborn behavior and for what I feel was me trying to avoid anymore disappointments.   I just don't want to push her away anymore than I am, but I feel like the longer I wait the more it confirms to her that really didn't care to begin with.

I (28F) have an amazing partner (35M) but a troubling past that can’t let me move on sexually. Please help! Background information included,"I (almost 28F) am dating a wonderful man (35M) who we will call J. He and I have been together for about five months now and he is everything I’ve always wanted in a partner; he is funny, incredibly kind, and has the same life goals and values that I do. We see each other on weekends, and sometimes if our schedules allow during the week. We have even had talks of moving in together in the future. This is the first time I’ve ever had anyone normal and so aligned to my interests - it’s awesome and I couldn’t be happier! 

Now for the TMI part. I have been inconsistently able to have an orgasm when I have sex with J. 

Before J, I was in a relationship when I was 19-21 with a bad guy named G (two years older than me at the time.) G seemed nice and everything, but slowly over the course of our relationship, he became verbally and emotionally abusive. I always have thought of myself as smart and aware, but when it happens to you so slowly over time you don’t even realize you are becoming a victim. G used the classics - what I was wearing was too slutty (it wasn’t), my friends are terrible and I shouldn’t hang out with them, why am I associating with these people, etc. I spent most of my college years alone in my room because I would have to text him pictures to prove where I was if I was out. I still get upset that I had some formative friend years pass by, but I am working to make things right now with friends I isolated myself from years ago when all of this was happening. 

When I first started dating G, I recently had lost my virginity to a friend I was seeing for a while but fizzled out. I was relatively new to sex. On a few occasions, G would go down on me and I was able to orgasm. Then, as the abuse started to culminate over time, I was unable to reach orgasm. Then sex literally felt like tiny cuts all over my vagina. Then I didn’t want to have sex anymore, but felt obligated. I was young and naive and only had one boyfriend before G - this is what boyfriends and girlfriends are expected to do, right? To make matters worse, most of my friends and even family actually liked his nice guy persona so I almost had a guilty feeling that I shouldn’t leave him.

The culmination of events happened in the summer of 2011. G went to live out of state to train to be a pilot. I was back home finishing up school. I was supposed to spend time with him over the summer for a few weeks, but did not want to go. I never knew if I would get Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. Long story short, he guilts me into coming out to Arizona and says stuff along the lines of “I am expecting sex. Thats what girls are supposed to do.” When I toyed with the idea of not having sex but going out there, he told me he would kill himself and I was his only friend and taking away his only pleasure. Abuse 101.

I ended up stupidly going. When I got there he trapped me without resources to leave for about 3 weeks. Most times when he came home, I was exhausted from sitting around doing nothing all day. Most times I would want to go to bed. One time we had sex and I didn’t want to. I stared at the ceiling fan and made a grocery list in my brain. I don’t like to call it “rape” because I know that others have had it way worse than me, even though I know that’s what it is. There was also a ton of stuff about how girls are whores, I am expected to be married and have three kids by the age of 25 (none could be girls or he would lock them in the basement), and a whole slew of other crazy values. Also, he and his family were staunchly Catholic. It was a really great combo. 

In the end, I ended up breaking up with him in December 2011. After that, my life kind of went into a spiral and I slept with eight people in three months to gain back control of my life. It physically hurt every time I had sex. I didn’t connect but rather disassociated during all of these encounters. I did it to feel valued and wanted, where before I was viewed as an object with G. These guys were nice people, and I even dated one for about four years. I however faked every orgasm I had to make the sex stop, as these guys wanted to make sure I got mine before they got theirs. It hurt and was uncomfortable, so faking it seemed like the only option to stop sex and finish it rather than communicating my needs. 

Fast forward to now. I have been in therapy for the last eight or so months with a wonderful therapist who specializes in sexual trauma and I have also been taking anti-anxiety medication for several years. I feel able to communicate my wants and needs and finally have a sense of empowerment. I actually went to the OBGYN and found out I have an auto-immune skin condition that is easily fixed by occasional ointment that will stop the creation of thin skin around my vaginal area (aka what was causing those tear like sensations during sex). Everything is looking up!

The problem is that when I am with wonderful J, I am inconsistent with orgasming. I trust him. I love him. He is so patient and kind and knows my back story. I feel a sense of guilt that it worked before but it doesn’t always work the next time. We have tried different positions, him going down on me, toys, etc. Sometimes he offers to step out of the room to relieve any pressure and I can masturbate to pornography with a toy. Even that is sometimes hard for me, albeit very sweet of him to look out for me. 

Occasionally I get flashbacks and a sense of shame. I’ve occasionally seen G’s face in my mind when he was going down on me and I had an orgasm with him. I believe my brain is associating enjoying that with enjoying the abuse. If it worked then, why can’t it work now that I’m in a loving relationship?

I guess the question I really have now that you know my backstory is how do you get over this hurdle if you are a survivor of sexual assault? Can I ever lead a normal, semi-consistent sex life? I know orgasm is not the end goal, but it would be nice to have. I do take a win with J because I can have sex without pain and I actually WANT to have sex with him, where as in the past it was a to-do with others out of obligation. I would definitely say J and I have a great sex life and great communication. I am frustrated that despite all of this, I keep running into problems. Is there something I could try to relax? Is there anyone out there who has been in a similar boat? I’ve been working with my therapist, but I am open to any other advice or ideas. ",1536459759.0,Ahhhheregoes,relationship_advice
I'm scared of getting into a relationship.,"M, 21, India.

As the title suggests, I'm scared of getting into a romantic relationship. It's not because I'm scared of getting hurt if things don't work out. What I'm worried about is girls misusing their legal rights to punish their partners without any reason. I know this may sound weird but it's the truth. In the name of women empowerment, laws, in India, have become biased towards the female gender. Here are a few cases.

1. My friend (let's call him X) and his girlfriend (Y) were in a relationship for 1 year but never had sex as the girl said she wasn't ready. X respected her wishes and never forced her. One day she agreed and they had sex.  Later, the rlationship became difficult to handle and the guy asked her to break up. The girl became furious and abused him. She even said that he used her for sex and threatened to file a fake rape case against him. He was shit scared and cried in front of me. She was serious. The result? It's been 3 months and he's still in a relationship with her because she wouldn't let him leave. She now abuses and hits him and forces him for sex. Whenever he tries to break up with her, she threatens to go to the police.

In India, if a woman files a case against a man, even if it's false and there isn't any evidence, the police will arrest the guy. All this happens just based on a women's statement. This is how biased the laws are.

2. I've read several cases on the internet where the wife files a dowry case against husband's family when she gets caught having an extra marital affair. I'm not sure about this one but I've read that, in India, if a husband has an extra marital affair than he's at fault and is punished by the law. But if a women has an extra marital affair, she isn't punished. Instead, they can file for a divorce and extort money from the other party.

You must think I'm paranoid and taking things too seriously. Maybe I am. But you can't deny the fact that if a woman wants she can destroy a mans life.

I'm not saying that all girls are like this but I've seen 2 such cases in real life and read about a lot of such stuff on the internet.",1513600798.0,tiny_fudge,relationship_advice
Is it sensible to lay off emotional attachment to anyone when you're 20? My (21M) alpha-lover beta-provider thesis and the dangers of monogamy for both sexes ages 16-25 apx.,"I have devised a thesis. It's quite a common theory, and it's mostly created by insecure virgin males with lack of success with women. It's also one that is causing me a great deal of stress around conversing with the opposite sex, and I am seeking relationship counselling for. 
Anyway, here is the principle 

-Due to higher testosterone levels in both sexes (particularly men) in teens to early twenties compared to late twenties/early thirties, younger couples are primarily looking for 

a) Sex 
b) Excitement 
c) A free lunch

Couples of this age are DELIBERATELY AVOIDING 

a) Emotional attachment (perceived as weakness and drama)
b) Responsibility (e.g. for another's emotions, their own lunch) 
c) Stability (as necessity for responsibility) 

Now I'm not being sexist as it works to the detriment of both genders, were women the chasers it would be pursuit of the Alpha Female Lover and replace all of the following in relation to women (more on that later) 

but because Patriarchy Hurts Everyone it is typically the women seeking the alpha male lover. 

The primary attractive facets of the Alpha Male lover are 

i) Good Looks (low body fat, lean and muscular or stocky and muscular, Hollywood-style sexyface e.g. cheekbones, jawline)

ii) Good Sex (experienced, and preferably a big dick) 

iii) Confidence/Cockiness ('bad boy' mentality, mystery)

iv) Social Proof (at this age, convincing his mates he's well 'ard and the girl's he's well fit. Actual contribution to society is immaterial, ego is everything) 

 Women of this age typically label men who get emotionally attached as becoming 'too much drama' or 'too nice' etc. This is why it does not pay to be a nice guy-by which I mean without looks or social proof you will FAIL to be attractive at this age 

-Women this age are also generally too emotionally immature and insecure to accept or even be aware of AL's tendencies for abuse, emotional detachment and sudden abandonment. In fact they are willing to accept the abuse subconsciously provided AL retains his AL stats, esp. Good Sex and Social Proof

-However Alpha Lover should note that young women of this age are likely to cheat and abandon for one with reader AL stats (read: lower body fat, better sex, more friends saying how fit he is, etc.)

-For this reason it is advisable to disengage from serious romantic relationships in early twenties. Testosterone levels are simply too high in both sexes to make for logical monogamy.

-Now what's interesting, this effect begins to slowly reverse from as early as age 25, now women typically seek the Alpha Provider Male

This man is distinct from the Alpha Lover in that his Alpha facets are

i) Confidence (as opposed to cockiness) since

ii) Social Proof (social worth; respected job, decent income, esteemed by adults for contributions to society. All in all respected for the RIGHT reasons)

-Provided a man has Confidence with Social Proof, his Looks and Sex Skills can be relatively inferior to that of the Alpha Lover. 

-It is important to be an ALPHA Provider rather than a Beta Provider, since from about early twenties onwards it is quite common for woman to cheat with AL while being  financially supported by BP. The difference between AP and BP is…difficult to ascertain at my young tender age of 21. 

However what is certain is that from about 22-25 one is at a VERY volatile age to engage in behaviours such as 'trust', 'fidelity' and 'honesty'. One is at an age where one begins to financially provide for oneself yet lacks the emotional maturity or low testosterone levels to hold down a long-term/long-distance monogamous relationship. Indeed men's T plateaus at 22 while women's T is on a constant rise 20-25, peaking at c. 25 y/o. This is why it is quite common for both genders to have affairs -it just so happens that due to Patriarchy the standard model is 'woman cheats on daytime boyfriend with money and a heart for night-time stud with big dick'

-My suggestion given this pseudo-research for AFCs in their late teens to early twenties is to disengage from monogamy, ideally stick to porn to supply their sexual needs, while improving their AP stats (Social Proof)

This translates roughly as: study hard, get rich, hit the gym, become well read and highly influential, become respected in your professional circle primarily (social circles become less relevant early 20s onwards) 

Note one's accepted body fat is inversely correlated with one's Social Proof. This translates as: it's OK to be fit and poor, or fat and rich, but if you're fat and poor you're screwed

Note also one's capacity to get away with volatile behaviours such as cheating, abuse and manipulation is positively correlated with one's AL and AP stats (but especially AL, age also works in favour here because APs tend to 

-Note also that with financial empowerment from feminism c. 1960s-undoubtedly a good thing-the necessity for male Providers has decreased, and in C21 we have the rise of the Alpha Female Provider (that is, rich and professionally successful woman). 

By contrast such environmental conditions as increased contraceptive use, hyper-sexualisation of the media and increased social approval of Narcissism (as noted by the rise of social media such as Facebook and the 'selfie'), positively encourage Alpha Male Lovers. 

There is also some suggestion to say that since there is less stigma on women lifting today, women's natural T levels are also rising. Alpha Female Lovers no longer hold the same social stigma that they once did. This has led to the rise of the Dominatrix.   

Therefore the dichotomy between this new breed of 'Alpha Female Lover' and the Beta Male Provider is quite striking and a turn-off. 
A BP is, in other words, dealing with as low social value as an AFC in C21

Occasionally we also have a godly male/female who reaches or even surpasses the attributes of the AL and AP. Notably these men/women tend to lift heavy. Let us call these the Ultima Male/Female

This is not me ADVOCATING cheating or abuse btw, this is simply an observation given my research into the Manosphere 


Now to reverse the model for women: 

16 to 21 apx. men seek women with Alpha Female traits. The most important at this age essentially being: 

i) Looks (beauty; typically defined in the West by tall, slim, long hair, sexyface etc.)
ii) Popularity (social conformity)
iii) Femininity
iv) Virginity 


Now unsurprisingly the Alpha Lover doesn't really care much about your feelings, he just wants your body and to deflower you because you're a pretty face. Due to AL's high levels of narcissism AL may be unaware, or simply sociopathic. However due to higher T levels and hyper-sexualisation of media, one would rather be treated like shit than with someone they find boring or unattractive.

20-25 The Beta Provider is an interesting specimen; this is your standard 'nice guy'. He likes you and he's a decent guy working hard for a living but you can't respect him. You don't know why this is you just can't. However you can benefit from BP's financial resources so you may enter an unrequited romance with this guy, perhaps offering pity-sex (justifying this as 'feeling sorry for him' or 'he's a nice guy') but as T levels are peaking . One is ALSO at an age where one realises that infidelity is pretty scummy so one has powerful psychological defence mechanisms in place to justify the act of cheating. These include 'I couldn't help it', 'a guy/girl has needs' etc. 

25+ Having had experience of both having your heart broken by an AL and breaking the heart of a BP, one is getting pretty sick of the shitty teenage relationship drama and just wants someone they mutually respect and can bring food to the able for oneself and one's children to enter a long-term relationship. Enter the AP, the man who typically makes the husband list. 

The fun doesn't stop there; while most AMPs are A enough to secure F's affections for life, some still exhibit too many B traits. Hence our current high rate of divorce, adultery, etc. This has been pronounced with the rise of the AFL and AFP as outlined above. According to social hierarchy, to 
bag an AFL/AML or AFP/AMP one must be an Ultima Male (UM, see above) or Ultima Female (UF)-no easy feat but there can only be one king of the (now urbanised, industrialised and domesticated) jungle!  

Tl;dr 

women age 16-21 seek Alpha Lover only. Attractive women of this age will be faced with the dating task of rejecting many young male Beta Lovers who came down with a nasty case of Oneitis. They will also have higher levels of entitlement, narcissism and unreasonable standards, a phenomenon I like to call 'princess syndrome'. Since women have higher social value (carrying the genetic code to human survival), Princess Syndrome is socially accepted.

22-25 seek Alpha Lover for emotional needs while Beta Provider for financial needs (unless are financially self-sufficient therefore in reach of Alpha Provider). One is of an age where one is beginning to let go of the enticing advantages of Princess Syndrome and take responsibility as a mature adult, but is not emotionally mature to deal with the idea of waking up to a less exciting lover. 

25+ Alpha Providers become a necessity, at this age both sexes tire of 'mind games' and the emotional manipulation/abuse they generally subconsciously enjoyed at a younger age. Now both sexes seek someone who can pull their own weight, emotional attachment  

Another way of putting this is:

16-25 apx.: Be an asshole to get sex, be willing to cheat/dump and be cheated/dumped on frequently; 

16-25 y/o nice guys evade all relationships at this age and seek to enhance one's social proof and looks (16-21) with additional interest in increase of financial resources and social (professional) proof 22-30

25+: Be a nice guy but with Social Proof


The evolution of Man typically follows either Adaptation A for the Nice Guy:

Beta Lover (nice guy loser in high school)-> heartbreak-> Asshole -> charges for abuse/emotional maturity-> Alpha Provider

Or Adaptation B Beta Lover-> heartbreak-> Beta Provider

Whereas the asshole follows Paths C

Alpha Lover-> charges for abuse-> Loser/Convict/Rapist 

or D 

Alpha Lover-> emotional maturity-> Alpha Provider


Note the primary differences between an Alpha Lover and an Asshole are looks and exual skill, whereas the differences between a Beta Lover and an Alpha Lover are confidence and social proof (of the 'he could deck you' or 'he's sooo fucking hot' variety as opposed). 
Oh and finally, 16-25 both sexes: I think you should be ashamed of yourself, your capacities for self-denial of your subtle emotional manipulation is enthralling. God.




Thoughts on the thesis welcome. Remarks such as ""you're a sexist pig"", ""you have issues"" and ""you need to see a doctor"" also welcome.

i (27m) in a healthy relationship with my gf (25f) found texts from a drunk ex fwb in my gfs phone. did i overreact by blocking her?,"
my girlfriend (25f) and i have been dating since a year. 

we’ve had our fair shares of hookups in our past but now i’m very certain of never bringing my past into our present. 

however yesterday night i saw her replying messages from her ex fwb (we share ig passwords) who was claiming that he is drunk & has a habit of texting her whenever he is so. i hate the fact that she was leading him on. at no point of the conversation she tried to shut him off. it was borderline flirty imo. messages like, “and? what is it about me that brings you back to me?” & the guy went “you’re impossible to forget.” 

we were on call when i saw it, (she was texting him despite being on call w me) i lashed out & immediately blocked her. did i overreact? she’s been texting me everywhere since morning saying it was a “bad lapse judgement” she felt bad to leave him drunk and alone. but that makes no sense to me. did i overreact?",1731151932.0,Smokerhythmwolf,relationship_advice
My (32f) boyfriend (36m) deleted my dead brother from my instagram friends. And he doesn’t seem to understand or care that I’m upset?,"6 years ago my twin brother Sam died in a horrible accident on the freeway. It was one of the biggest accidents in our state. My only comfort is that he died immediately. The police said he most likely had no idea anything was happening around him.
Anyway before he died Sam was a huge social media user. Mostly on Instagram and snap chat. I never followed him on Snapchat but I followed him on instagram. He made thousands of posts about his life(friends, family, music) he was an amazing singer. After he died I would go to his account and just scan through his account. I mostly watched a few videos he made where he does a dialogue for ESL speakers (he taught English to ESL students for extra money). I'd often pretend that he was speaking to me.
 
I know it’s not healthy to listen to my dead bothers voice everyday but it just became a habit. A few weeks ago my boyfriend had been urging me to break free from this. He told me that I need to move on. I did start. I would only watch one video. Or even not use my phone until right before I went to bed. Last night I went to check my brothers account and I saw that it was gone! I was upset.
I texted my sister and she said that she could still see his account. My boyfriend told me that he blocked my brother on my account. I was annoyed but simply thought I could just go back to following him. But my brothers account was private and our family couldn’t access his account years ago. 
The reasons why he blocked him is because he thought I was “in love” in my brother. And even accused me of being once  intimate with him, my brother. I wanted to vomit. He’s my twin! We spent every single day together. Even when we grew up we went to the same university. At the time of my brothers accident we were roommates. 
I loved my brother but not in a sick way. My boyfriend never met my brother. He and I only started dating 2 years ago. But after this I don’t know if I can/should continue this relationship.
 My boyfriend keeps saying that I should move on, that what he did wasn’t a big deal. But it was to me. Our mutual friends agree that I should just forgive and forget but I feel like I’m grieving again. 

UPDATE: I kicked him out. I gave it a few days for me to calm down but this was just a breech in trust. He still thinks I'm overreacting. And I've also cut ties with out mutual friends (they were mostly his friends). This incident made me realize I need to spend more time with my family. I've been chatting more with my sister; after Sams death I was a bit cold towards her. But she has helped me a lot these past couple of days. Also thanks to some amazing people on here we were able to get into Sams account. I'm now the owner of it. Thank you all.

My bf's ex (30F) spent the night in my bed with my bf (30M) but he recorded it to show me (25F) nothing happened... how do we overcome this?,"I'm extremely hurt but to my bf's credit, he was very upfront about everything. He texted me immediately the morning after to tell me everything.

My bf, let's call him James, broke up with his ex gf, Winnie about 2 years ago. They chose to stay friends and this has caused some issues between James and I, mostly because Winnie just can't get over the breakup. She thinks her and James are soulmates and she just refuses to accept that he stopped being in love with her.

So a conversation they will very often have is James literally spending hours going over the logic of why he broke up with her. He tries to reassure her since they're still friends and she's hurting but I have witnessed some of these conversations and he's loving but firm. I suspect some of you will say there's still something going on but there really isn't. James is definitely over her.

James and I moved in together just 2 weeks ago and this has caused Winnie to be worse than ever. Like she relapsed with the depression and the crying fits, they're happening constantly again.

I went back to my parent's place this weekend because I had to pack my car full of some more of my things, and I spent Saturday night there. Winnie must have known this because Saturday night she showed up at our place. Crying, wailing, the works. We have a doorbell camera and I got a notification as soon as she was at the door. I didn't see it right away but as soon as I saw it I texted and called James and checked our indoor camera to see what was going on. This is where James messed up, and he admits that he messed up. He didn't text me the whole night while Winnie was there.

So all I knew was that she showed up, I checked our indoor camera we keep in the living room by the front door and it was turned off. This is normal, we only turn it on when we're away from home. But I was extremely upset and distraught as I was imagining the worst. I trust James but I just didn't understand why he wouldn't answer my calls, and he admits it was horrible of him.

I was ready to break up with him Sunday morning but he texted me and immediately let me know that Winnie had come over. He said it sounds really bad but she spent the night but nothing happened and he set up our indoor camera in the bedroom to prove it. I didn't want to believe him but I did watch the footage and even though it shows both of them laying in bed, it's true that Winnie was just crying while James was consoling her.

There are some things he did that bother me a lot. At some point he kissed her forehead, and he hugged her and held her close several times. I'm honestly speechless at that. But I understand he knew there was a camera on him the whole time and he knew I would see him doing that. So I guess he doesn't see that as cheating.

So basically James is asking me for understanding and for forgiveness. I have the proof that nothing happened, but I'm still hurt. This isn't how I imagined us starting our life together. What are the healthy next steps for our relationship?",1731525736.0,ThrowRAundecided393,relationship_advice
I (28F) found out my husband (29M) has been telling his coworkers that I'm his sister. What do I do? Please help!,"Throwaway account because I don't use or understand reddit but I really need advice from someone not connected to me or my husband. 

My husband (I'll call him Josh) and I have been together for 6 years, married for 4, and we don't have kids. We have a really healthy and communicative relationship, we're both pretty easy-going and I really love him. 

He started working at a large accounting firm about 3 years ago, and from what he tells me he loves it there. He's made a lot of friends through his job and he goes out with them for drinks and social events quite often, and I've been totally okay with that. I'm quite introverted so I've never been interested in meeting his colleagues or work friends, nor have I asked to. I've got my own circle of friends and I'm fine with us having separate friend groups. After what happened yesterday it only just occurred to me that he has never actually asked me if I'd like to meet any of them, or go to one of his work events, I guess that's important context. 

Anyway, I'll start with what happened a few months ago, that I had brushed off until now. I was at a bar with some friends for a couple of Friday after-work drinks, and a guy approached me (he was there with some friends, too). He looked slightly familiar but I hadn't met him before. He seemed friendly enough, and he asked me, ""\[My name\], right?"" I think I must have just given him a confused look, because he followed up with, ""I'm Jake, I work with Josh."" 

I realised that I recognised him from some photos on my husband's phone (I don't use social media except for a private Instagram, so I'm not sure if he posted the photos anywhere - but we've got a very trusting relationship so I look in his photos sometimes - don't hate me). This is where it gets a bit embarrassing. I'm a bit socially awkward and so I struggled to end the conversation, but he just kept talking at me, I guess he was already a couple of beers deep. But while he was talking, he said something like, ""It's great that you guys are still so close. I haven't talked to my brother in ages."" 

At the time I was like, huh? But I just assumed he was drunk and not making sense, so I ignored it. He started to get a little flirty so I turned to my friends and we left shortly after that. I didn't say anything to them about it and it didn't seem like a big deal to me. I also decided not to tell my husband that I had met his coworker Jake. Not to hide it, but because I figured the guy wouldn't even remember talking to me, and I didn't want to make it awkward for Josh at work by telling him his colleague tried to hit on me. I just thought no harm no foul. 

But, yesterday morning, I was out walking our dog, Monty (he's a cross between a few breeds and has very unique markings - this matters I promise) and was on my way to my regular cafe, which is in town. I was waiting in line to order, and the guy in front was an older man. He got his coffee and turned around, but stopped and looked at my dog and goes, ""Hello Monty!!!"" Monty was super excited to see him, apparently, and so I guessed that the guy was another colleague of Josh's, because Josh brings the dog to the office a couple of times a week. 

I thought it was sweet, to be honest, so I smiled at him and said hi. He introduced himself (I guessed correctly that he was a colleague), but then he said something like, ""aren't you a good sister, walking his dog for him!"" 

I was so confused that I didn't even know how to react at first, so I stumbled on my words and just said ""it's my dog."" I regret it but I genuinely couldn't bring myself to correct him and say that I'm Josh's wife and not his sister. It was just too awkward, and I just wanted to leave because I think was suddenly dawning on me what might have been going on. He asked me something about ""sharing a dog"" but I was able to escape the conversation by being next in line to order my coffee, and he left. 

I seriously don't know what to do, because what the fuck????? Do I even ask my husband about this? Part of me is just assuming or hoping that it's a mistake, that he doesn't talk about me much at work and they assume we are related because we both have brown hair (???). But the thought that he has been telling his coworkers that I'm his sister (and evidently they have seen what I look like, so they must have seen photos) makes my stomach churn. I don't even know how I would broach the subject with him. 

I need some help - what would you guys do in this situation? I have only told one friend what happened because it's so weird and embarrassing, and she has jumped straight to ""time to plot his downfall"" (because she's my ride-or-die, love her), but I don't want to immediately assume the worst or ruin my marriage over something that could be nothing. 

I'm sorry for the long and rambly post, but I would REALLY appreciate any and all advice!!

**Edit**: Holy fuck, thank you everyone who commented with some advice! I haven’t read all of them but I really appreciate the suggestions from you guys. A small update, Josh came home at about 2:30am last night, but he was drunk so he just went straight to sleep, which is fine by me because fuck having this conversation in that state. I’ve just woken up but he’s still sleeping. 

First thing I just want to clear up - I’ve seen a lot of people suggesting I have crippling social anxiety, or am severely introverted, which I suppose you could glean from the way I explained what happened, but I’m not! I meant that I’m slightly introverted in that I’m not the most eager to meet lots of new people at once, especially a bunch of finance bros whose weekends consist of unending sports bar beers, where I assume I would be mansplained everything until my ears bleed (prob a negative assumption, but I’m sure some of you know what I mean). I suppose you could say that I’m “confrontation averse” in that I’m quite laid back and prefer to keep a conversation easy and positive, idk. I don’t like it when things are awkward and correcting when people misrecognise me is one of those things, but I’m not terrified of confrontation. 

Also, my husband and I do share some mutual friends, I didn’t explain that well but our lives are not entirely separate. The way he acts towards me around our mutual friends is extremely affectionate and normal. It is only his “work friends” that I have never interacted with. 

I’ve also seen some people suggest that what is going on is equivalent to my husband beating me and me hopelessly wondering whether I should break up with him. Or that I’m stupid for thinking my relationship was healthy when it “clearly isn’t”. Like, damn, cut me some slack! I’m a real person and this is an entirely alien and bizarre situation for me. My first reaction wasn’t to assume the worst but I do appreciate that you all have made me certain that it is a big deal. I guess I needed confirmation that the things that happened are enough “proof” that Josh has been purposefully lying, and they weren’t just mixups. 

I’m going to talk to him today, and ask him directly why he’s telling his coworkers that I’m his sister. I followed the advice of writing my points down so that they don’t get lost if I get emotional, lol. I will do my best not to let him slither out of it and I hope he has some proof that his colleagues know I’m his wife. I know that’s not the theatrical confrontation you guys were hoping for, but it’s a Saturday, and I can’t wait! Wish me luck, thank you all!! ",1723809842.0,ThrowRA-TakeawayCrab,relationship_advice
I (f 31) am too attracted to my man (m 33). Is that a marker for a healthy relationship? ,"My bf and i have been dating for more than 8 months now. I am always attracted to him. Like, ALWAYS! Even when we're fighting or he's being an @$$. According to my friends, him and i do not make a good match. Partially because of how our relationship had a bumpy start but also because my bf doen't seem to be 'conventionally beautiful'. 

All of them keep disapproving of his looks but i just can't see it?!?! Every time i see him or even think abt him, i become a giggly, idiotic person who has 2 brain cells. When i first fell in love with him, i remember i could feel literal fire all over my body as if i was really on fire. 

My biggest worry is, is me being attracted to him like this a red flag? Is this how love is supposed to feel like or have i just gone completely c0l0rblind?

Boyfriend (20M) asks for my(20F) nudes within a few months of getting into the relationship. Is that healthy?,"We were friends for almost a year. We ended up falling in love and have been together for a few months now. He asked me for my nudes. I am not comfortable with sending any. He claims to love me genuinely. When I said I didn't want to send, he keeps requesting me. Calls me with derogatory names used on women when he feels horny. Always initiates sexting. Lustful conversations are more as compared to friendly ones. When I question his intentions he tells me he is in love with me. When he isn't horny, he talks nicely with me and is even loving.  But those times are less as compared to the times he sexualises me. ",1727616341.0,ThrowRA_North-Show-,relationship_advice
UPDATE: My (21F) Husband (26M) told me that he listens outside the bathroom door the entire time I'm showering to see if I'm masturbating. How can I tell him that this is a violation of my privacy and personal space without him feeling like I'm disrespecting him?,"[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/X1lene3tJt) to original post for context.

TLDR: I confronted him about this being an invasion of my privacy and he did not react well. I am leaving him and moving in with a friend until I'm done school next month, before moving back home. 

Thank you so much to all of the amazing people who commented and reached out. I wasn't able to respond to anywhere near all of them but I am so grateful to everyone for opening my eyes to how toxic and unhealthy this situation is.

As I stated in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/6YrfdVAheR) update, I called my dad and basically just explained that we were having some issues, and just to ease my mind I wanted him to come down and be nearby when I talked to my husband. 
He did not press for more info and told me that he was on his way. He and my mom live ~6 hours away, so it's not exactly a very ideal ask but he didn't even hesitate, which I am grateful for.
He arrived Friday night and parked outside our condo and we agreed that id call him and immediately hang up if I needed him to come inside, in case my husband got aggressive or angry. I did not expect him to, since he never has before, but some of the comments made me feel like I'd better be safe rather than sorry.

I debated all day Friday about how exactly to approach this situation and how I could trigger this conversation without him shutting down or getting angry.
I decided to casually approach the conversation and ask him how he'd feel about me getting another vibrator (to replace the one that mysteriously broke after he 'caught' 'me using it in the shower).
In response he asked ""what for?"" To which I replied ""because it feels good"".
I knew this would be his response, but it was something along the lines of ""what am I not good enough""? As it usually was in the past. I explained to him that it has nothing to do with him not being good enough, and that sex is supposed to be fun and experimental and interesting and that it was just something that would make it better for both of us. He then suggested that I just wanted it to use on myself, to which I asked if that would be a problem. He told me that I know how he feels about that and so I asked him why he was bothered by the idea of me masturbating. He got very defensive and asked why I would want that when I could have him, so I asked if he ever felt like he'd rather just pleasure himself rather than going through the motions of having sex. He said no and that he's ""not a beta who spends his days stroking when he could be doing anything more productive"". I explained to him that that was okay if it was his preference but that sometimes my sexual desires are to pleasure myself versus having sex. That's when his same ridiculous argument came out of that being ""basically cheating"". Pulling from another Redditor, I explained that cheating involves multiple people, and that it is impossible to be cheating if I am alone. He told me to ""fuck off and go stick the shower head between my legs"".
I started to get upset and realized that here is when I always back down. I feel the need to apologize and make him feel better, id usually have started something and would end up guilt fucking him because I felt bad, but I didn't. 
I told him that he made me feel like he was trying to control me and my body and that I wasn't okay with that. 
He told me I could ""go be a fucking whore somewhere else then"" and got up off the couch and ran upstairs. I could hear him slamming my drawers open and acting like he was putting my clothes in a bag.
I resisted the urge to run up there after him and just decided to sit there and see what would happen. Eventually he came back downstairs and apologized and said that he's very uncomfortable with the idea of me masturbating in our home, when I asked him to explain why, he said because it makes him feel unwanted. I told him that this isn't true, and that I do want him, but sometimes I just want that and he said ""okay I guess"".

I decided to leave it at that for the night, and didn't want to press any further. I told my dad it was okay to go and that I was so sorry for wasting his time and he told me he'd be staying the weekend at a hotel just to be safe.

Eventually we went up to bed and I realized if I left it at that it would just get swept under the rug like it always does. I'd go on putting up with this until it came full-circle again and I was not going to do that to myself.

I decided to ask him about him telling me that he listened to me when I showered.
I told him I wanted to talk about it and he told me that he was just joking and that ""I'm a fucking moron if I actually thought he was serious"". I told him that it was an odd joke, especially considering he was angry and very much not laughing when he told me. He insisted that he was joking and I told him that i didn't believe him. He then responded by saying he wouldn't do it again. This went in circles for a bit before he finally admitted to deciding to do this after catching me in the shower. Instead of accusing him of anything, I asked him if he thought that was an invasion of my privacy, to which he informed me that we are married and I do not have privacy. I told him that was an issue and that in order to have a healthy marriage we both needed privacy. He was determined that there is so such thing as privacy in marriage, so I flat out asked him if he wanted me in the bathroom while he was pooping. He said no, I said ""right , because you want your privacy"". He told me that's different. 

Over the course of the next 10 minutes or so, this escalated from a simple conversation into a full blown screaming match, and we got absolutely nowhere in our argument. It was like talking to a brick wall. I was so heated by this point that I don't even remember what was said, but he eventually told me I was: a fucking worthless whore, that i had nothing without him, that my vag was disgusting and made him sick, that I was fat and no one will ever want me (I'm 125 lbs btw), that im lucky someone like him would even look in my direction, etc, etc, etc.

I could barely see my phone through the tears and I called my dad and asked him to come get me. 

My husband looked at me and said ""you're fucking dad isn't driving 6 hours to come get you you dumb fuck"".
I started to grab some random things of mine and yelled that he was here staying in town, and he broke down and started sobbing. 

He told me that he knows he's controlling, that he has serious issues, and that he's terrified of losing me. He said that he knows he's not good enough for me and that he's so afraid of losing me that he's pushing me away to save himself the inevitable heartache. He said that if he ever lost me he'd k*** himself. 

As I watched this grown ass man snotting and crying in a heap on the floor, I kinda realized that I feel nothing for him. Like, nothing. The blinders I've been wearing were removed and I no longer saw the handsome, intelligent, caring, strong man I once did. I saw a pathetic, abusive, controlling, sad, and sick person. I came to the realization in that moment that there's no fixing this, and even if he does change, I would never trust him or see him in the same way again. 

My dad knocked on the door and my husband ran and hid in the bathroom. I took my bags and went outside to meet him. He asked me if I wanted to talk about what was going on and I said no. He asked what I needed from him and I asked if we could just go back to his hotel room. He asked if my husband hit me and I said no. 
Before we had even gotten to the hotel my husband began texting me. It started with pleading with me to stay and forgive him and turned into insults over the course of the next day or so. He never threatened me physically, but told me if I didn't come home I'd lose him forever, that I'd be losing out on the best man I'd ever have, etc, etc. he told me that his friends laughed at him for being with such an ugly bitch, that his parents hate me because they know I'm not good enough for him, that I couldn't get pregnant because I'm probably a fucking whore banging other guys on the side, that he was embarrassed to be seen with me in public, and so much more.

I'm leaving. And not because Reddit told me to, because I'm genuinely not even remotely interested in staying with him and because I deserve better.

I spoke to a friend from school, and will be staying with her until I'm done school next month. After that, I'm going home to figure some things out and get a fresh start.

I'm currently in bed in a hotel room with my dad and have never felt more loved or safe. He is going to go over to the house tomorrow and retrieve my belongings, after which he is helping me move into my friend's apartment and then heading home. 

I don't have much to say at this point other than thank you again to everyone who made me realize how dangerous this situation could have been. I was determined that we were not going to divorce but after Friday night I don't think there's any going back to that. I'm over it. 
I might update again, I might not. But making that post genuinely might have saved my life. Thank you.

My (27F) fiance (26M) set boundaries around what I can talk about with him. Is this healthy?,"Essentially the title. My fiance and I have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 8 months. Over the last 2 years, he’s ask me not to talk about or drastically limit how much I talk about certain topics, including: work, niche topics that I’ve extensively researched and really enjoy, and our wedding. Today, he added the cat I recently rescued to the list. 

This has severely limited the topics that I talk to him about and made me feel that he just doesn’t want me to talk. This is backed up by comments that he’s made about how monotonous and hard to listen to my voice is. 

Writing this out, I totally understand that I sound like a boring person, but he knew most of these things about me coming into the relationship (we knew each other before we started dating). 

However, I understand that those things aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. I used to talk at length about these topics, but I’ve worked really hard not to talk about them too much with him. I even set daily reminders on my phone not to talk about the topics that bother him until it became a habit. 

Initially, he said I didn’t need to set the reminders, but he was noticeably happier when I started talking less in general. 

Meanwhile, he continues to talk at length about the similar topics that he’s asked me not to: work and his favorite topics to research. When I’ve brought up what I felt like was a double standard, he said that anyone could understand and relate to his work, whereas he doesn’t understand mine. 

I’ve also made an effort to at least listen to and encourage his research topics, even though they’re not my thing, and he says that these are the only things he has to unwind outside of work, a physical, public-facing job. 

It does make me sad—I believe in encouraging people’s favorite topics, and I’d really love to have that reciprocated from my partner. Instead, the list keeps getting longer. When I want to give him important updates on my work (like that I’m going after another job), I have to preface my update with “I’ll make this quick” or “2-minute update,” and even then he looks like he’s been forced to endure. 

Several times, when those things (especially work, which has been especially rough for me this year) are all I can think about, I find myself with very little to say that won’t go against the boundaries he’s set, but I still want desperately to talk to someone. On those days/weeks, we’ll have very surface level conversations.

Especially then, I talk a lot to our 3 cats and now the rescue cat, mostly nonsense things about how sweet they are and silly made-up scenarios, and then we just slow blink at each other back and forth—it’s great. 

This upsets my fiance. He’s made comments about how he’d have to act like a cat if he wants me to talk to him and give him attention. I’ve explained that I’m just going through stuff at work, and don’t want to talk his ear off about it. 

I’ve tried having conversations about how to resolve this so we both get what we need, but he usually turns it back on me in some way. 

This can’t be healthy, right? Or am I overthinking it/missing something? We’re about 2 months out from the wedding, and I’m struggling to finish wedding DIYs because of what this would mean for the rest of my life. 

TIA for any advice.

ETA: Didn’t expect to get clocked this hard, but yes, there’s a chance I am somewhere on the spectrum. I haven’t pursued a formal diagnosis. He doesn’t believe he is and only fit 1-2 criteria when we looked a while back. 

Some additional info and clarification: I did previously talk too much (1-2 hours in some cases) about work and my favorite topics. I realized I was doing it after I suspected that I be autistic. This is something I’ve been working on really hard (re: topics aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, and I recognize that). I rarely talk about anything for more than 15 minutes now; 30 for topics where he engages, like when I tell him that I want to change jobs and how it could affect the two of us. 

My fiance has called me annoying before but says it’s endearing. 

Some people have suggested he might just be with me for chores and cooking, etc. I’ve taken over all of the cooking, but I really struggle with chores, but I’ve been trying to do better. I’ve improved gradually over the last several years. This is a main source of our arguments. 

I apologize for the length of the post. 

TL;DR: Fiance asked me not to talk about topics like work and hobbies. Adds to the list, but talks about his own interests the whole time we’re together or on the phone. I did use to talk for 1-2 hours, but I’ve worked hard to make sure I don’t talk that long now because I know it can be exhausting. I do engage and ask questions about his interests frequently.

My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I’m using his ex’s words against him?,"Throwaway account because I don’t want my boyfriend to find this. I posted this elsewhere but thought this subreddit could help too. 

I (28f) and my bf (30m) who we’ll call “Steve” have been together for 2 years and have  been living together for 8 months. I was cleaning our apartment when I found a note in the back of a cabinet. For context sake, I’ll copy it below:

“Dear Steve’s Future Girlfriend,

I know it’s you reading this because he’d never clean back here. I’m putting this here because I’m leaving him soon and want to warn you about him:
1. He will not clean
2. He will not listen
3. He will make everything feel like it’s your fault 

It’s not your fault, he’s just an incompetent man. I’m leaving him, I suggest you do the same.

Best wishes,
Natalia “
(name changed)

I read the note and brought it to show to him and hear his response. He immediately ripped it up and said not to listen to it, that she was crazy and untrustworthy. I told him that the fact that he hasn’t found it in the 5 years since they broke up is a red flag to me because it does mean he’s never cleaned back there and that he has been cleaning less and less since I moved in. He told me that it wasn’t a problem before the note, this is just his ex continuing to manipulate and ruin his life and I was letting it work. We continued to argue along the same lines and I eventually left to spend the night at a friends place. 

Steve has been a great boyfriend so far. He gets along with my family. He has given me gifts and flowers and always tells me how much he loves me. He’s not wrong that the cleaning hasn’t really been brought up before, the note made me realize it had been less and less and that we needed to have a full conversation. He texted me afterwards saying he’s sorry that I felt like I had to leave but that it’s an asshole move for me to take a note over our 2 year relationship and to leave him and our pets alone.

I don’t know what to do or what to believe right now. I’m contemplating trying to find and reach out to Natalia, her name in real life is pretty unique so I think I could find her. Steve thinks I should come back home and let it go, that his past should effect our future. I feel like I could be the asshole because everything Steve has said about Natalia does make it sound like she was manipulative and petty throughout their relationship, but I don’t know what to trust.

Edit: I realized I didn’t clarify enough about the points, especially the cleaning. thought I’d add it here:

When we moved in together 8 months ago, the cleaning was 50/50. Since then, he’s been doing things less and less and i’d say it’s at like 70/30, maybe 60/40 if he listens to me right away (it depends on the week). I have to remind him to do things like bring his plates to the sink or take out the trash and I didn’t have to before. The dishes will pile up unless I do them, to the point he’s had leftover food mold on the plates. I’m not a confrontational person so I was just asking him to fix it when it came up. The note made me reflect on it more and try to have an actual full conversation, and I will say I didn’t feel listened to when I talked to him about it. I tried to use the note to start a conversation about cleaning and he got so stuck on that I was listening to his ex instead of him, that he wouldn’t listen to what I think are valid concerns. He thinks I’m letting the note have “confirmation bias” so no matter what he says I’ll think he’s in the wrong.

Also, I didn’t leave him permanently, this all happened yesterday and I only spent one night at a friends because I didn’t feel like our conversation was going anywhere last night and he wouldn’t let me sleep until I let it go. I’m going back today and wanted to get advice and feedback before I do.

Edit 2: I appreciate all these comments with advice. I’m heading back to our place now. My plan is to first apologize for immediately bringing him the note without thinking of his feelings and validate 
that it’s hard to have an ex’s message found.

That being said, you’re all right that I’ve been letting the cleaning stuff get away. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I have to ask him repeatedly to clean. It was pointed out to me that he should’ve cleaned the shelves during his move from his ex’s place, the fact that it hasn’t been touched in 5 years is forcing me to take the not seriously. I don’t want to throw away 2 years so I am going to ask him to come up with some clear cleaning expectations with me and designated chores. I will make it clear that cleaning is absolutely a deal breaker for me. It’s his decision on how he wants to respond. 

I’ll try to update you all. Again, thank you so much for the advice. 

UPDATE:

I followed your advice from the last post and tried to have a calm discussion with Steve. When I apologized for confronting him with the note, he seemed to take that as an admission of guilt and refused to listen to anything else. I had come up with a list of specific instances of not cleaning like many of you suggested, and he said I was using lists just like his manipulative ex did. So yeah, the crazy ex thing you all said was a red flag was definitely true. 

When I realized the conversation wasn’t going anywhere, he even tried to block me from leaving. That’s when I knew it was done and left immediately. 2 years down the drain, but I’m glad I had the wake up call before it was too late.

I will let him cool off and then will ask my brother to come with me to grab my things while he’s not there, he has a strict work schedule so I think it’ll work out. I am planning on leaving a note there, but probably a little longer with the advice to not show it to him. I’m leaving it in the exact same place, so if he doesn’t learn his lesson about cleaning, it’ll come to haunt him. All he has to do is clean.

The biggest surprise out of all of this is that I didn’t reach out to Natalia, she reached out to me. Apparently he borrowed his friend’s phone to call her screaming that she’s ruining his life still. The fact that she blocked him and he still had her number memorized just further confirms he was the crazy ex not her. 

Natalia found me on social media and wanted to make sure I was okay and was especially concerned that he’d gaslight me like he tried with her. I thanked her for leaving me the note and saving me time. We scheduled coffee for Thursday afternoon. 

I wanted to thank you all again for the advice, especially the person who posted the love is respect website. I took the healthy relationship quiz after our conversation and it wasn’t great. You called out how he was weaning me into an unhealthy relationship so well. 

For now, my friend said I can stay until I find a new place. I have emergency savings and a decent job, so I’m in a privileged place when it comes to this messy break up and am just trying to feel grateful for that

Just posted my final update separately, thank you all for everything",1724798847.0,ThrowRA-ex-note,relationship_advice
My BF (26m) put his hands on me (19f) this morning. Can you guys give me advice?,"This morning, my bf (26M) and I (19F), woke up so peacefully, had sex, and went into the kitchen to make some coffee and breakfast before I went to my classes. We were talking while the coffee was brewing and then he starts shadow boxing me. (He boxes and was pretending to punch me) while I was standing there asking him over and over again to please stop doing that because I don’t like any form or representation of domestic violence. I have a hard boundary about anything close to or representing domestic violence wether it be verbal or physical. Anyways, he was shadow boxing me and I asked him 4 times nicely to please stop doing that and that I don’t like that or put up with that kind of thing, the fifth time I told him I’m dead serious and he better stop now. It was almost as if he was deaf to my requests, and whole time I never even raised my voice to him. He continued to shadow box me after I told him I was dead serious about it and when he didn’t stop that fifth time, I took a glass full of water and doused him with the whole thing in his face. Then I stormed off to his room. 

He then came to the room and told me that I needed to clean up that mess. I told him it’s not my mess to clean up and that it’s just the consequences of his actions of not listening to me the first 4 times I asked him to stop. Eventually, I got up from the bed I was sitting on, mind you the mattress is all the way on the floor, I get up and he shoved me hard as hell back on the bed in an aggressive way. I get up again and he does the same thing again. Then I tell him he ruined the date I had planned for later today and that I’m leaving. Then he takes my bag of clothes and hides it across the house. I go to the kitchen looking for my bag and this whole time we’re screaming at eachother. Then he shoves me again and screams at me to get the fuck out of his life. I go to leave his house and he won’t let me leave, and he’s holding my property hostage. Eventually I get out of the house and get into my car but he then brings my bag back but takes my phone to get me to come back inside. I take his glasses off his face so he gives me my phone back, and he damn near smashes my phone on the floor. Eventually he brings my phone and he gets his phone and glasses from my car and is trying to talk with me and reason with me.

It’s difficult because this is a dealbreaker to me. I always vowed that if a man ever put his hands on me that I’m leaving the first time and not sticking around for a next time because if I stay they’re gonna think it’s okay. His behavior was extremely erratic and toxic and almost scary because he’s a boxer and could seriously hurt me if he wanted to. In general he’s the sweetest person but he sometimes has these episodes of acting crazy and neurotic. We’re already going through things in our relationship and I just don’t know if he’s good for me. Especially now that he put his hands on me, I can’t, out of respect for myself, tolerate that and return to him. I started crying in the car and told him that now I’m gonna be scared of him, which he would hate for that to happen, but thats what happens when you put your hands on a female. That’s a big no no and  a subsequent deal breaker. I know I deserve so much better, I just don’t know if this is stuff that every couple goes through and if it’s somewhat normal in healthy relationships. Would it be healthy to leave or stay?

TLDR: My boyfriend disregards my requests for him to stop shadow boxing my face and he doesn’t listen so I splash a cup of water on him. We get into an altercation where he shoves me 3 times and and holds my property hostage and doesn’t let me leave his house. I eventually leave and I don’t know whether I should leave him or try and work it out in our relationship.

Update: Thankyou guys for all the responses. And also I appreciate the devils advocates calling me out on the water thing. Y’all are right, I could’ve walked away. It was in the heat of the moment and what’s done is done. I’m glad it happened though because now both of us have a burden lifted off of us and it was a dead end relationship anyways. Thankyou all for your support and feedback. Definitely a learning experience, I’m leaving him, and I’m not looking back. It’s time, I’m grateful, and onto better things :) 

Ps. I posted this looking for confirmation that I should leave him and leave no room to second guess my decisions of leaving. It IS a hard boundary and I’m going to enforce that. It would be disrespectful to myself and victims of domestic violence to stay and condone abuse. As for anybody reading this going through something similar, I suggest you leave too! There is too much love to find and experience to ever settle for anything less than the best!!",1731607644.0,k1nkyk1tten,relationship_advice
Told my wife (F35) that she couldn’t do it without me (M34). Turns out she can.,"
I made one stupid selfish comment to my wife a week or so ago and now my life is in disarray. 

My wife is in some crisis. Her work is closed and she’s being paid, but she’s home with our kids now, including one 3 year old. She gets breaks on Monday and Friday with childcare. We went into having kids knowing she wanted to be a working mother. So this has been an adjustment… to say the least. 

Onto the OG fight. She spent a long day with our kids and the neighboring kids, and when I came upstairs from work and she asked for a break, I didn’t respond well. I made excuses and didn’t offer help and for the first time in years my wife lost her temper and cursed at me. 

Like an idiot I dug in and thought I was right. I admit we both said some unkind things. But after reddit humbled me and she made me sit down and write a list of things I did for the family that day and compared it with her… longer list, I apologized. She accepted and I figured things would go back to normal. 

They haven’t. My wife used to include me in parenting our kids. I did dance pick up most weeks and bedtime was split. I gave baths. Made dinner. All the stuff. Since our fight, my wife hasn’t asked me for any help with the kids. The first morning I woke up on what was supposed to be my morning with the kids, I figured she was just being nice or trying to prove a point but it keeps happening. She didn’t even send them down to say good night last night. Normally my wife does this silly game where she sends my son to ask me to read 5 books and then we would negotiate down to 1 or 2 and race upstairs. Last night I heard her racing him and came up to find her doing bedtime yet again. The kids haven’t even noticed. It’s like she’s replacing me. 

When we were fighting I said something really really dumb that’s living inside me and festering. My wife was being nasty and said “you wouldn’t see the kids a quarter as much as you do if I didn’t arrange it and I’m done managing you.” I defended myself, I’m not an absent parent- and said something along the lines of “I’d like to see how long you can manage without me.” 

Consider my foot officially in my mouth. 

She’s started running again. She’s cooking really healthy and often. Every night I come home to my perfectly happy stepford wife, doing it all without me and I feel empty inside. 

How do I fix this? I don’t even know where to begin… at this point I want to beg her to go back to how things were. This wasn’t what we agreed on.

Edit: Fuck guys I get it. I’m a piece of shit. I’m going to make this right. 

Edit 2: thank you to the handful of people that reached out with advice. Believe it or not, I do want to be a good father and husband. I’ve royally fucked up and I see that and fully admit it. This is going to be my only edit and then I’m going to get off my phone for a while and focus my attention on my family. My wife had dinner cooked when I got home. Everything is fine between us so there wasn’t any tension. After we cleaned up I went upstairs and ran my wife a bath, put Taylor swift on her Alexa and lit a few candles. I told her to go relax upstairs for the night. She was surprised but smiled and went on her way. I’m currently on the toilet watching my kids take a bathe. People mentioned love bombing etc. but I’m just trying anything I can to show her I do appreciate and love her and our family and I want to be a present father. I’m going to do bedtime tonight and probably all next week. I’ll tell her she does so much during the day and deserves the break because it’s the truth. I get that I come off as an asshole. I grew up in a not great situation and didn’t have the best role models growing up. I’m terrified of my children not having enough and I overcompensate by working too much. This new job came with a big pay increase but the hours are longer and I feel like I can never keep up. I’ve reached out to a few recruiters tonight. I used to love my job and was always home by 4:30. Even if it means taking the lost income, I’m thinking about going back. 

Relationships are hard. And humans aren’t perfect. For all the people telling me my kids don’t love me and I’m a waste of space, idk guys, just remember I’m an actual person. That shits rough. Anyways that’s all I have for you folks. I need to watch these kiddos and start planning out my long road of groveling and reconnecting. Thanks all! 

Update: 2/18 
It’s been a minute since I bothered with Reddit, but when I logged in it seems some people care for an update. It’s not exciting. I’ve taken a lot of time to really LOOK at the man I’ve become. My wife and I are 100% back to being a team, but I’ve realized I wasn’t stepping up the way I always wanted to. I promised my wife a partnership and even though it’s been a month or so since our fight and my wife keeps asking me to “forget it happened”, I can’t. My therapist is helping me sort through my overthinking. 

My wife started therapy b/c of the stress losing her work (temporarily) and staying home has caused. Her issues appear to stem from feeling “useless” without bringing in a paycheck and was taking on too many tasks at home to overcompensate. She doesn’t feel like she deserves breaks and when she takes them she feels awful about herself and like she’s ‘lazy’. Coming from the LEAST lazy person I know, I can tell she’s struggling. And I’ve been supporting her the best I can. I often make sure she knows I think she deserves breaks. So when I see her hyper fixating on cleaning the floorboards I intervene gently by reminding her that this doesn’t need doing right now but that I will finish it for her while she does me a favor and takes a little break. Sometimes it works and other times she tells me to “stop fussing and leave her to work” and I do. It’s been working well and I don’t mind the extra work for the peace of mind it offers me. My wife is my everything and her happiness is paramount. 

My kids are mostly clueless to all this. We don’t involve them. And I must say, I made a throwaway comment about my wife not loving child rearing and received a lot of nasty comments about not having kids we don’t want. I’m weary to dignify this with a response but will say what I meant was that we agreed before having children that my wife would not be the sole support system for them and that she would never feel obligated to quit working. My wife is fiercely independent due to her past and a big part of her comfort in our relationship comes from her ability to leave it safely if she ever needed to. That trauma is hers and I won’t touch more on it other then to say I agreed to this aspect before we married and do not mind it. She SHOULD be an independent person. I’d want the same for my kids. 

So that’s basically it. I’ve taking on the role as primary parent. I get my kids to daycare/school and home and while my wife helps half the time, it’s now my responsibility to see who is doing what and coordinate things. I can’t do it all in my head like her but i have a chart that’s been helping. She rebelled at first but gave up the reigns surprisingly easily. She needed a break. I also put my son back in full time daycare although my wife keeps springing him early, I can tell she likes the break. That’s all I have for now. Thanks guys and sorry it’s not more dramatic. I know some of y’all wanted my balls and were hopeful my wife would leave me. While I would be lost without her and the thought makes me physically ill, it’s nice to see people appreciating my wife the way she deserves and stand up for her so fiercely. Thanks all! 

One last thing: I bought her this game PalWorld on the computer. She hasn’t gamed since having kids b/c of some pre-conceived conclusion it made her a bad parent but I insisted she spend a few hours and since I’d spent money, she did. I find her playing a lot to wind down when the day is over. It seems to be helping her feel more herself too. So thanks video games! I’ll stand for a lot of assumptions on my character- and boy have there been some nasty ones- but one thing I won’t take is people saying I don’t love my wife. She’s my person and it is my duty in life to make her happy. ",1706290010.0,get-a-lifee,relationship_advice
"My(M32) wife’s(F27) ex-boyfriend sent me a video of him having sex with my wife , after he found out we’re having a baby. How can I even deal with this?","My wife and I have been married for 4 years and we’re expecting our first child. Everything has been pretty normal and alright in our relationship. I do know her ex-boyfriend since they’ve been together for such a long time before we met. But didn’t hear anything about him after we got married. I always found our marriage pretty healthy and perfect afterall. Nothing ever made me feel doubtful or insecure, until now. Last week we had a little party with our close friends and family to announce my wife’s pregnancy. Everything was alright and planned but somehow someone , maybe some mutual friends told my wife’s ex boyfriend about her pregnancy. So around 2 days after our party , he texted me. At first I thought It’s just a simple drunk text and stuff but shit was worse than I thought. There was a video. I tried so hard not to watch it cause I knew that would be nothing good to watch anyways. But then I finally did. And I wish I never did. It was a video of my wife having sex with him. The concept of seeing my wife having sex with someone else even thought It was for many years ago was already fucked up enough. But I hate the way that it was also so… passionate. Romantic. I don’t know how to explain it but you could literally feel the connection between them. And I hated that. It was like my whole life got destroyed in one second. My head got filled with messed up things. Messed up scenarios. Messed up doubts. Now I can’t take it out of my head. My wife’s noticed something’s up but I haven’t told her about it yet. I don’t know if I ever will. 
In my whole life I’ve never felt worse. I heard my wife telling another guy that she wants to have his kids. While she’s carrying my kid… Man I hate this situation but I’m really confused. Don’t know how to deal with it. Don’t know how to take these stuff out of my head. Should I tell her? Should I just go beat the shit out of him instead? Should I just get over it? Any advice would be appreciated. ",1712363929.0,ThrowRAdave-y,relationship_advice
My (42F) boyfriend (44M) is upset I have purchased a new dress for my work dinner. How can we move forward in a healthy way?,"Me ‘F42’ and my boyfriend ‘M44’ are having a disagreement about my work conference. We have been dating for about a year. I have a work conference coming up in my local area. I started this job a few months ago, so this is my first time attending this conference. However, in my career field, I’ve been attending conferences for over a decade that involves a dinner on the last night. 

I asked my manager if we were allowed a plus one to the dinner and she said no. This is only for the company employees. My manager mentioned that this will be a black tie event. I have a lot of beautiful dresses in my closet, some I’ve never worn. However, I don’t have any floor length gowns. I told my boyfriend I was going to Macy’s to buy a new dress and he said I should wear something in my closet. 

I explained that I needed a new dress due to the dress code and that I’m excited to buy a new dress and get glammed for a night. I very rarely get to get glammed up. He was upset and said he didn’t understand why I had to buy a new dress. He told me he would talk to me later and got off our FaceTime call. 

I went to the mall and saw several beautiful dresses in my price range of about $150. I texted my boyfriend and told him most of the dresses were 30% off and I could probably find a great dress for under $100. I took a few pictures of dresses I saw to get his opinion, but he said he does not want to be a part of this process at all. I texted him back and told him that I understand and I would no longer involve him in this. 

The dress I picked is navy blue. I’m completely covered. No cleavage or legs out, etc. I am respectful of the dress I picked out and the fact that I’m in a relationship. About a week later, we talked about this subject again, and he was even more upset. He said he didn’t understand why I wanted a new dress. I told him that when we met last year, he bought a brand new suit for his office Christmas party, that he did not invite me to. He said that’s different because a plus one was allowed. But I shouldn’t buy a new dress and get glammed up if my significant other can’t be there. 

Anyway, as I tried to defend my choice, and point out how I am allowed to buy new clothes and get glammed up, he got upset again, and told me he would talk to me the next day. Before he hung up, he asked me if I’m a leader or a follower.  A few days later, he said that he thought I was “looking for attention”. I was honestly hurt and shocked by this revelation. I am dressing for the occasion and want to feel pretty for a night. 

I told him at our ages, I will not have someone policing my clothing and what I buy. I dress modestly all of the time. I’m mostly in jeans and tshirts and he tells me to dress up more often. He even asked me why I don’t get a bit more dressed up to go to Target and the grocery store. I told him I like to be comfortable. We get to wear jeans in the office, so the only time I really get to dress up is dates with him and church. 

TLDR; My boyfriend doesn’t want me to buy a new dress for a work conference because he thinks I’m looking for attention. 

How should we settle this, come to a compromise, or move forward in a healthy way?

Update: I just got back home from breaking up with him. The conversation lasted less than five minutes. I cried as I drove to his house and all the way back home. I’m taking a sleeping pill so I can force myself to go to sleep. I blocked him from my phone and all social media accounts. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice. Good night. 

Final update. Someone asked me about the breakup and I put it in a comment, but here it is.

I walked into his house with the few clothing items he had at my house. When he saw the clothes, he said, ""wow, I thought you were coming over to talk, but you're coming over to break up with me."" I was already crying when I walked through his door. I was trying to compose myself. I told him that no matter what l do, it never seems good enough. 

I mentioned how I'm always so supportive of him and I constantly trying to meet his needs, his love languages, his way of thinking, etc.
He cut me off and said, ""you're breaking up with me, so let's stop this conversation."" In my head I said ok, but the words didn't come out of my mouth. He then said, ""all of this over a dress that you didn't need and still want to wear"" and ""I'm glad I didn't marry you because you always run away when I have an opinion"". He also said, ""everybody has different opinions, but communication is key, not running away"".

Inside, I secretly hoped he would see my tears and say to himself, wow I'm being so stupid right now. I'm losing the love of my life over a dress. But he doubled down.
He looked in the bag of the stuff I was returning and said well ok then. I looked at him for a second, then went ahead and walked out of the door.

He texted me about ten minutes later and said, ""Ok I will give you what you want sweetie. I hope all the best for you and (my daughter's name). Let her know I love her.""

I didn't reply and that's when I blocked him.
When I walked in the door, my daughter said, “mom have you been crying?"" I said yes and told her I would take a sleeping pill and go to bed. She asked me what happened and I told her I broke up with him. She said she would cheer me up by showing me some of her favorite YouTube videos and she gave me a hug. So at 3 am, the time I'm typing this, my daughter and my puppy are asleep in the bed with me.

I feel deep sadness and a bit of relief. I no longer have to walk on eggshells anymore or explain myself to my boyfriend. But I loved him very much. I know all of the good times are going to play in my head for a while. I'm going to think of him everyday for a while. I'm going to miss him. He's the first relationship I've had in the last 6 or 7 years.
We cooked together, laughed together, sang together, watched movies, had dinner and movie dates.

But he also tried to control who I talked to, who l hung out with, what I was eating, what I was wearing, he was critical of me, ignored me when he was angry, talked over me when I treated to explain my point of view. He knew I was kind when he met me, but he was trying to get me to not be so kind to other people, because, ""it didn't make him feel special if I did for others the same things I do for him."" He asked me how is he more special or set apart from other people.

When we met, I was around 150 lbs. I got back down to my original weight of around 140 and he told me I needed to put the weight back on. (That part I don't understand).
When we would be having regular conversations, he would start lecturing me.
He would ask what l ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. When I would answer, he would start saying I needed to be more disciplined.
When I would take a nap on the weekends, he would say l'm not being productive.
If I didn't reply to his texts quick enough, he would be upset and ask why I didn't have my phone near me. He said I should take my phone from room to room in case he urgently needs me. 

When I would FaceTime him before bed, in my comfy pjs, he would ask me why I don't wear prettier pjs to bed. 

Honestly guys, I’m just exhausted. I didn’t sleep well and mostly cried all night. I’m a mess this morning, but I’m working from home so that’s a plus. I know this will get better with time. I’m not sure why I put up with this for so long. Relationships are complicated. There’s so much good, and a bit of bad, and I just didn’t know the right time to exit. When I’m asking Reddit for advice and over 1,000 comments see the red flag behavior when I’ve only shared a really small piece of my relationship was a wake up call. Thank you all.

UPDATE: My (35M) mother's (58F) new fiance (24M) wants me to call him 'dad'. How do I navigate this?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gpjag0/my_35m_mothers_58m_new_fiance_wants_me_to_call/) and slightly amended the title for clarity. Anyway so I told both my siblings and we agreed we'd collectively put our foot down with Phil at our next family dinner next week. Especially after an incident where Phil referred to my brother as ""sport"" and asked if he wanted to go see a baseball game with him. Admittedly...I was a bit spurred on by what you all said and got involved, pinging him back with ""aw no tickets for me daddy 🥺"" and my brother responded with ""daddy wants to me all to himself hmm? Hot 😉"" and Phil took a few minutes to respond before saying he was 'shocked, speechless and disgusted'. He then messaged me in private to say he was 'utterly appalled' and that he'd 'never disrespect his own father the way you boys did'. I kind of lost it at this point and said ""right, that's because you're not my father Phil, you're a 24 year old manchild dating my mother. You have no right to my respect, especially not to the respect a father gets."" I immediately said sorry but then blocked his number and left the group chat. Apparently he sent a similar thing to my brother who responded with more daddy stuff and Phil blocked him.

Well uh, that aside, I don't think that family dinner is going ahead. After the original post blew up it seems someone from his Lions Club found it and reported it to their Chair or whatever and Phil has either been expelled or resigned or in the process of one of the two. He has removed nearly all mentions of the Lions from his social media and no longer mentions being a member with his last post on it being some cryptic goodbye post where he kinda drones on about what it means to be a man in the modern day and the 'duty of fatherhood' bestowed on all men at birth, really weird shit. My mom called me half in a panic, half in a rage after, about the ""stuff I'd been telling"" about him before breaking down and saying we need to meet, which we did and got my brother to go over too. I know he has temporarily moved back in with his parents in the next town over but from my understanding they still want to go ahead with the wedding. But I think that's moreso because they've already spent money on it.

When she said she was ""determined to have more kids"" (plural...) my brother did step up and asked if she really thought that was a good idea at her age, and I pointed out that assuming she had the baby next year, and she lived to 80, they still wouldn't have finished college. She just stammered on about how ""people live longer these days"" before breaking down crying and admitting she's not ready to give up on mothering due to some deep-seated trauma and fears about the family breaking apart that I won't go into for her sake. When we re-assured her that we weren't going anywhere she calmed down and we had a very good honest conversation where she's agreed to drop the IVF stuff on the grounds that it'd be too expensive and unlikely to get greenlit (but she's still adamant it's scientifically possible and she should be *allowed* to do it from an ethical standpoint because she has to win that argument :/) and has agreed to look into fostering instead. Me and my brother highly doubt anything will ever come of that so we're not that worried anymore. The very good news is she's also agreed to look into therapy/psychiatric help to deal with her trauma and we've helped get her in touch with a nice lady in town to unpack all this in a more healthy way. So at least one person is getting the help they need. 

I have no idea what's happened with Phil or what's going to happen with him but I did make it clear to my mom that he is not my 'dad', he's not even my 'step-dad', I'm not a kid. And he's never going to be either one outside of legal fuckery. She relented pretty quickly (I think she's finally broken out of her shell at least) and we've agreed that if things go ahead that's going to be a huge red line though I dunno if he'll want to be friends with me after all this lmao. Anyway thanks for the help on the original post y'all.

Edit: Bit of an update as I can’t respond to everybody but I think the marriage is off. Phil has gone awol again and has had a _huge_ argument with his family as they’ve demanded he call off the wedding and date people his own age. This apparently made him snap. Me and my mom have met his mom and older brother who said Phil is very insecure around girls his own age and has “never been able to talk them” hence his…preference. This very deeply upset my mom and after some begging from all of us, she has agreed to “push the wedding back” though she wants to keep dating him. I have no idea where Phil is, though his brother assumes he’s couch surfing with his DnD friends who have been sending me and my brother some not nice messages because clearly we’re just jealous of “the milf Hunter.” If any of you socially inept fucks are reading this, I don’t need to chase middle aged folk because I can talk to boys my own age like a normal person.

UPDATE: My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I'm using his ex's words against him?,"Here is the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f2umej/my_28f_boyfriends_30m_ex_hid_a_note_about_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). 

As you can tell by my original post, I like to do things right away. It was definitely a mistake to bring him the note right away, but doing the things I did this morning right away was not a mistake as it allowed me to save my pets.



First, I want to respond to the comments saying I broke up a 2 year relationship over a note and chores. No, I broke up a 2 year relationship because when I tried to come up with solutions to an unequal situation, his response was to yell and try to convince me there was no problem except me. The final straw was when he physically blocked me from leaving the house after he was screaming at me. That is not okay and no one should stay with a man who responds to conflict like that. 



The actual update: I wound up texting the post to Natalia last night and she thought it was great. She, like some of you, asked me about the pets. For context, one of the things Steve and I connected on was our love for little creatures. It's why I thought he was such a great guy, because if he could take such intricate care of his lizard, he could do the same with me. I was very wrong. He has one lizard he bought before me and then we bought 2 frogs together. I have a snake I brought with me when I moved in. I was planning on waiting until he cooled down to go grab my things and the frogs and snake, thinking he would never hurt them, but Natalia changed my mind. She said he could get destructive when he's mad and was concerned about the safety of my little guys. I immediately knew I couldn't wait until later this week and reached out for a meeting with the landlord for early this morning.



I wound up facetiming with Natalia last night and we had a long discussion. Natalia is a lawyer and told me that in our state, landlords are required to let me get out of the lease I signed in cases of domestic violence. She also told me that his yelling, gaslighting, and refusing to let me leave are all types of abuse. It's definitely hard for me to sit with that, but the love is respect relationship quiz helped me also realize that a bit more last night. Apparently his constant messaging and control over what I wore and when were signs of abuse too. 



Anyway, this morning Natalia volunteered to come talk to the landlord with me alongside my brother. As soon as he heard the word lawyer, he was on top of it and said I could break the lease, but would still have to pay for all of August even though I'm leaving 3 days early. I felt like that was fair. He also messaged Steve to say the apartment needed to be empty for emergency maintenance all day today so I could pack my things. Steve messaged back that he was at work all day and wouldn't be home until 6pm. 



When I got into the apartment, it was a mess. He had broken my dishes that I had brought with me on the ground and left the shards laying about. My clothes were ripped up and scattered around our room. It was disgusting and heartbreaking. He left his lizard alone, but opened the tank doors for our frogs and my snake. Luckily the frogs were still chilling in their enclosure, but my snake had gotten loose. This made me the most mad, as she could have gotten cut on the broken plates. I feel so fortunate that she was just hiding in the closet corner and I was able to pack her up safely in her enclosure again. All my things are packed and I'm writing this as my brother drives me back to my friend's house right now. 



Natalia told me that she actually left 3 notes, one in the cabinet, one on the underside of the vacuum, and one in the crumb catcher of the toaster. While we were there, we checked to see if the notes were still there. The one on the vacuum was but it looks like Steve did clean out the crumb catcher at least once in the past 5 years. He never told me he had already found a note in our conversations, so it caught me by surprise. 

  
Natalia and I left the vacuum note as is and replaced the cabinet one. I wasn't comfortable leaving my name on a new note, so my addition was a handout on healthy vs unhealthy relationships and a qr code to the quiz that woke me up. (I'll put it in the comments, I'm not sure if I can have an outside link)



Natalia said if he didn't find the notes in those 5 years, especially after the move, he probably won't find them again. I'm inclined to agree, especially given he did find one but then didn't even clean the rest of the house to see if there was anymore. Steve doesn't make sense to me and seeing the state of the apartment really woke me up to the fact that I have no idea who he is. The Steve I knew would never put animals in danger, but I don't think I really ever knew Steve. 

  
To the people saying it's pathetic that I broke up my relationship because of chores and reddit, I encourage you to reflect on the subtle ways that abuse starts. This reddit thread woke me up to it and gave me the resources to get out safely before it got any worse. 



I also made an appointment for a therapist. I'm very lucky that my job has good insurance so I should be able to work through this relationship and am hoping to focus on boundaries and my people pleasing habits so I never find myself in this situation again. 

  
To the people wishing that Natalia and I would get together, we had a good laugh about it. Natalia is engaged to a wonderful man who cleans, listens, and reflects. She said there's a phenomenon that when people break up with their awful ex, their soulmate can quickly follow. I'm hoping that's true. Regardless, I do think I got a good friend out of this, especially since Natalia is a snake mom too. 

  
This is my final update. I hope if you learn anything from my experience, it's that abuse doesn't start right away. First there's love bombing, gifts, and pretty words. And then slowly, they test how much you'll put up with. You should never have to put up with anything, especially moldy freaking plates. 



TLDR: After ending things due to his behavior, Steve destroyed our apartment and let my snake loose, but I was able to get off the lease and get my things with Natalia's help. Now I am safe and am looking for a new place to live. ",1724855505.0,ThrowRA-ex-note,relationship_advice
Husband (M31) think it's weird that my friend will bring a sex toy when she and I (both F31) travel together. How can I explain to him that it's not weird?,"I do not give my consent to share this post on social media or any public platform.

Update 8/30/24, 2 nights later

Thank you for all your insight and guidance. You helped me understand his point of view and that it was okay for him to have this boundary (\*not ok that he couldn't discuss it or communicate openly). I had some laughs reading through the comments and felt validated by all the people who have an equally open friend group.

We talked it through last night. We've been normal, on the surface. Basically he thought that I had the potential to cheat on him with anyone since my BF and I talked about sex toys so comfortably. I tried at length to explain the whole girl talk, but he doesn't get it. He says it doesn't have to do with her being bi. We also aligned on the fact that he feels uncomfortable when I discuss sexual activity with anyone else, especially if about him. I reassured him I have never shared details about our sexual activity. He agreed that he needs to work on healthy communication and stop with the glum and silence. He apologized for acting this way and I know he is remorseful. Many of us you asked if he gets like this; usually not. It's only if jealousy is involved, which doesn't happen often. 

However, there are 2 things that are unresolved to me:

1 - he jumped from ""she talked about sex toys"" to ""she would cheat on me"", and then he started the conversation I described in the original post but then gave me the silent treatment. And he never communicated that he was afraid I would cheat on him that night. If I had never requested to talk through this issue, what was he going to do? Be glum and silent forever? Just go on with our lives? I plan on discussing this with him when I'm back. This to me warrants counseling. Like if I thought he was cheating on me, I would be talking and questioning like crazy. He just shut down and stopped trying.

  
2 - his conservativeness and sensitivity around talking about sex gives me the ick. I never knew this about him before, and no the sex is not vanilla. We've talked about sex with ourselves; I guess he just doesn't want me to talk about it with others. I know this is to each their own, and some of you will disagree with me. I need to process this one more. 

  
That's it. I'm going on my trip! If y'all have more advice on #1 and #2, I would welcome it. Thank you!

So, the characters:

Husband and I have been together for 13 years, married last year and finally moved in together after. Both of us are straight. Our relationship has been very happy. This is our first disagreement this year.

Best Friend (BF) and I have been friends for 12 years. Eight years ago, she moved to another state for school and stayed there. We visit each other every year or plan an annual trip, sometimes with other girls from our friend group. We talk at least once every week for an hour or two, catching up. She was my maid of honor, and we have been there for each other through thick and thin. She is bisexual and had one girlfriend in college; all her partners after were straight men.

All of us went to college together. They've known each other from the beginning. We've hung out together. She's visited our place multiple times. They text each other happy birthday.

So, she and I are going on a week-long trip together on Saturday. This has been planned for months. Last night, we were on the phone talking about what to pack. She asked ""Should I bring my sex toy? Are you going to bring yours?"" I replied, no, because I don't have any I use anymore. She joked, ah married life! We moved onto other topics.

Now my husband overhears and gets upset, holding it in til we get to bed. ""Are you going to tell me why you guys bring sex toys on a get together??"" From talking to him, his concerns are that we are using it together and that it's weird to bring a toy on a trip, and people only use them at home. I replied 1) it's weird for me to even think about using it with my friend and our friendship is not like that, and 2) I don't understand what's weird about this situation; we have separate rooms in our airbnb as usual and that's her business. She can do whatever she needs/wants, and it doesn't involve me.

He turned away saying it's weird and hasn't talked to me since. To me, he seems jealous and has a misconception about masturbation but I don't know if this is just how people feel?? Can you help me understand how he is feeling and how to approach this situation to explain to him that it's not weird to me and he has nothing to worry about?",1724946521.0,got_Mojo,relationship_advice
Devastated and spiraling. I (M35) found a condom wrapper in my wife’s (34F) car. Now what?,"
We have been together for about 10 years and married for 6. We have no kids now but we were planning to start trying pretty much now. 

We are both very active, going to the gym, eating healthy and are both in relatively great shape. My wife is gorgeous with a phenomenal body but I would probably consider myself maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10 on the attractiveness scale. I realize that. But we have always had a really strong relationship. We started as great friends, realized we were just right for each other, and that developed into true romantic love and devotion. The sex was always fantastic. There were never any issues there with quality or frequency. 

I was washing my wife’s car, as I do pretty often. In the course of cleaning the interior, I found an open empty condom wrapper under her passenger seat. We don’t use condoms since she had always been on birth control. 

I am driving myself insane with all the stories and scenarios running through my brain. She spends a lot of time at the gym working with weights and doing her cardio. Like, 3 hours four days a week so there are frequent times when we are apart. She has never given me a reason to suspect she has been unfaithful. 

I know I have to confront her but I’m scared to death of what might be the truth. She is my world and I can’t imagine starting a family with anyone else. I’m afraid I’m going to break. 

EDIT TO ADD:  

Wow. You all are amazing. I am so touched by the DMs and heartfelt responses. I had no idea I would get so many responses so quickly. I wanted to add some details to save me from having to to reply to all the common comments. 

My wife has never given me a reason to think she has cheated before this. She has always been loving and affectionate and we were looking forward to starting a family very soon. Some have speculated that kids coming soon may have led her to one last fling?? I dont know. Possibly. We are an open book to each other with our finances pretty much entirely tied up as one. 

She comes from a pretty upper middle class background her parents are very comfortable. I come from a home where my parents were fighting their own demons, and so I didnt get a lot of attention growing up. Not a criticism, it was easy to get lost in the shuffle of my parents problems. We are cordial but not super close. I am way closer to her family and I love her mom and dad and younger  sister. 

Financially we are fine. Together we make about $150k per year. She makes $60k as a law firm assistant I make $90k as an auto technician. We own a house together that we were able to purchase with a down payment from her family. If worst comes to worst I have no interest in fighting for that money. It is theirs and they can have it back if we end up selling the house. 

Some have commented about the amount of time she is at the gym. We go to separate gyms. She gets off work at 4 and goes straight to the gym where she does a class, then works out with weights and the cardio on the treadmill. I was never suspicious of the time she spends there. By the time she gets home, I am already there and she jumps directly in the shower and then we make dinner together and hang out. 

As far as a lawyer or an investigator there’s no way I could do that in secret with the way we manage our finances, so that’s out for now. 

Someone explained to me how to get detailed phone records from Visible so that’s my next step. I will get the records when I have some time to myself and see if there is a number that she’s in contact with a lot that I do t recognize. I’ll try to figure out where to go from there and let you all know.

My son 45M is dating a much younger girl 19M,"Edit: please stop messaging asking if I want to get revenge by dating a younger man. 


I (69f) have two sons. The younger one (37) is married to his high school girlfriend and they have two daughters. The eldest Sam (45) moved to NYC to focus on his career and now he’s at the point when he can relax a little. All mothers love their sons but he is objectively good looking, tall, smart, successful and kind. He’s had a couple of (his age) long term girlfriends. I’ve always been sad that he hasn’t found a life partner yet but understood he was doing it at his pace - until I met his girlfriend a few days ago. 


Over thanksgiving, both sons flew home to us. My son brought home his girlfriend that he’s been dating for almost a year. I’d heard about her from him and he sounded happy but he’s not the type to share that much with me or his father. When he said he’d like to bring her for thanksgiving we were very excited to finally meet the girl he’s serious about.


When she walked in, we were all shocked. She looked so young! So beautiful and mature but definitely young. I pulled him aside and asked how old she was. He looked embarrassed and said she was turning 20 soon. I never expected him to go for someone so young. Maybe someone 30 or 35 as I know he wants children soon, but not someone in their first year of college. 


We went back to dinner. I didn’t want to make the poor girl feel bad (my husband and younger son staring was rude enough) so I was very welcoming to her. She’s very intelligent, nice, confident and so on but in the manner of a precocious teen. Her family are wealthy so she’s not financially dependent.


Dinner was awkward but fine. At the end of the evening everyone went to bed but it made me feel nauseous to know what was happening in my own house. The next day they (edit: they left together but split when he dropped her at the airport) had to leave early so she could see her family. My son went to visit his childhood friends in our hometown but he’s coming back tomorrow. 


Is this relationship possibly healthy? Can I voice my concerns or is it none of my business? Has anyone dealt with something similar in their family?",1701043879.0,THROWRAhfjocug,relationship_advice
"Is it okay if I (26f) ask to break up with my boyfriend (26m) because he wants a ""healthy relationship""?","We have been together for 4 months now and are absolutely in love with each other. I would never want to break up with him but I've realised that what we require in a relationship is very different. 

My boyfriend wants a balanced relationship where we have lots of time to ourselves, don't message often, do everything on our own and be independent. 
I honestly don't care for the dating rules of society. I want a relationship where we are codependent, need each other 24/7 and just stay in each others company even if we don't talk or just do our thing. I don't believe there's true love in a couple that lives are two individuals together. I think love is when you become one together. I don't care if people think that's unhealthy or whatever. I will always be dissatisfied and feel like a hook up/friends with benefits partner unless this is how connected we are. 

My boyfriend is an angel. He's the kindest softest person ever and I feel like I'd get slapped in the face by god himself if I hurt this sweet innocent man. So I tried to break up with him twice over this. He had a mental break down and started shaking and talking rubbish about karaoke and foods with tears streaming down his face. I do love him with all my heart so I couldn't stand to see that and took it back. 
Every time I broach the subject he rejects the idea completely. Last night I thought I should say something mean to him and just end it with him hating me so he doesn't feel like getting back but he still refused and then had nightmares and woke up sick, having to skip two days of work. 
He's way too soft and delicate to deal with breaking up. On the other hand he doesn't want what I want but forces himself into the role. 

How do I go about this? If I could make this work in any way I want to. I truly feel like this is the one guy I'd never forget and always think back to even if I married and was holding the hands of my grandkids on my deathbed. I've never met someone this pure and gentle and so full of love yet this relationship is terribly dissatisfying to me and it hurts to be given love in spoonfuls when what I want is an ocean. 

I know I sound a bit cuckoo but please help me find out what needs to be done. ",1733454931.0,ThrowRAinexp,relationship_advice
Boyfriend doesn’t want to sleep with me and is unattracted to me. What do I do other than just lose a little weight? I am 24F boyfriend is 29M.,"I  Gained maybe 10-13 lbs from birth controls, eating his diet, etc. 

Im an athlete so im used to having to cut weight now and then. And understand how hard it is for myself to maintain since the start of my current relationship. But I trust the process and I like being healthy. Have some financial restraints keeping me from also having a fitness membership on top of my gym but I have lots of stuff at home. Except a sauna :(

My boyfriend admitted to me that he does not sleep with me or initiate sex because he’s not attracted to my body. I have a bit of cellulite on my legs and I’m 5’3 so any weight gain really shows on my short legs. I wear a size small top, sometimes medium if I’m in the juniors department, and a size 4-6 woman’s pants.

I’m upset that he is unable to be intimate with me solely off my weight…and not because he loves me… I’ve been upset about my weight for a bit and have been dieting and working out for 2 months already and he dropped this news now. In the past when we met I got down to 124 to compete. But gained and before that I sat 130-135 very comfortably.

I’m currently 5’3 and 139.
This topic has made me really lose more confidence in myself and I feel less of a person to my partner and frankly don’t understand how gaining 10 lbs makes your lover stop loving you. Enough to even have sex. Been together 10 months or so. 


I initiate almost every time, BJs, head, etc. I always pleasure him too. And he never really wants to pleasure me. 

Is this valid? Ofc I’m going to keep working out to hit my goal. But is that right on him? 

Edit: I really don’t want to lose him. I’d prefer to talk it through and help him understand. But I’m really at loss for words.

My other posts explains some other things. 

His reposes were:
“It’s not what I want YOU to be. it’s just what I expect for me”
And
“It’s not at all because I do. we still have sex if I didn’t want too or wasn’t attracted to you then I wouldn’t or wouldn’t even get hard honestly “


Edit August 2024:
I put my foot down. And I was tired of a lot of things. Reality kind of hit him. And he cried and he was extremely sorry. I wanted to break up. Because  he seemed so upset and unhappy with me and vice versa.

He never thought I would leave. And a reality hit him that he was the one that needed to be better and work on himself. I went to therapy and talked with her about navigating continuing the relationship. His remorse. Seeing if he would change etc. 

He did. He changed, he actively took the steps he needed. He got very sick the following days and quit smoking weed. Worked on his finances better etc.

He’s working on turning his life around. And I’m supportive of that and happy with how things are evolving. But being smart as well. ",1718810315.0,Junior-Mud-822,relationship_advice
I'm [29F] divorcing my husband [28M] for suggesting an open marraige... complicated feelings,"EDIT/UPDATE:
Hello, all. I wanted to say thank you all for the support. As for the update, where do I even start? It has officially been over the required 90 days since initially filing for divorce before it can be deemed official. I am going to the courthouse tomorrow to file the remaining paperwork. We had an easy, uncontested divorce. We agreed on pretty much everything, and he didn't even give me a hard time about taking our 2 cats that are quite attached to me (he was always the spare human). I bought a small home for myself and said 2 cats and moved a few days ago. I won't lie, this whole process was very tough for me emotionally. It was especially hard considering he was constantly hot and then cold. He would jump from name calling and trying to control who came over to our house to finding reasons to call me  on the phone all day and joking around with me like nothing was wrong. I feel like I have emotional whiplash from the last 3 months of living with him while looking for a new place to live. At one point, he came home to see me eating a meal I just cooked during a break from packing. It was pretty disorganized, but I was in the middle of doing multiple things at the same time. He saw the mess and started yelling at me for it and throwing my things around the kitchen. Another day, he texted me asking me why I wasn't interested in where he had been spending his days off and later sheepishly asking if he would drop the open marriage demand, would I ever consider trying again. Of course, I told him we were way past that, considering the multiple times he promised he would cheat on me if we didn't open the marriage. 
Also I did get STD tested and came back clean as a whistle. I don't think he was already cheating. But he is damned embarrassed about this whole thing. He wants me to tell people he cheated on me when they ask why we are getting divorced instead of telling the truth of the matter. 
He was made aware in advance that after I moved and the divorce was finalized, I would be going no contact. I did all the leg work to make this happen, including getting all divorce paperwork and 2023 taxes filed, separating all bills and bank accounts, hiding the address to my new home, blocked him on all social media and I will even be changing my phone number once everything is finalized. He feels that me going no contact is ""vindictive."" No matter what he has said and done to hurt me, I still have a lot of love for this man. He doesn't deserve it, I know. But that is exactly why I need to go no contact. It's for my own peace and to maintain some semblance of self respect. I can't tell him that because I don't want to give him (or myself tbh) any false hope that we could work things out. I have no plans to be with anyone else in the near or distant future. I just want to work on building my confidence and get in a healthier mindset. I haven't gotten to counseling yet like many have suggested. I was in survival mode for the last 3 months so I could get out of that hellish situation. Now that I'm in my new house and getting unpacked, I'm sure I will be able to relax enough to start feeling better soon. And if I don't, I have every intention of seeking professional help. I have a huge support network between friends and family. Our shared friends were all on my side as well. Not that there is a true right or wrong in a situation like this, but one of his best friends telling him this was the biggest mistake of his life was incredibly validating. The only thing I regret from my relationship with him is staying as long as I did despite all the red flags I ignored throughout the years. I went into detail on some of them in the comments. All I know is that I'm feeling a mix of relief and grief. I just need some time to allow myself to heal. 
Out of our many conversations, he told me that 99% of open marriages fail because they were opened for failing marriages and that since we had a great relationship, we would have been fine. I tried explaining to him that I learned (from some of you guys) that what he suggested was NOT an open marriage, but is was parallel polyamory and it was the most difficult form of polyamory to achieve. He didn't care and was only focused on convincing me to work it out with him. 
For me, there is nothing to work out. He wants to be with someone else and to fall in love again. So I am giving him the freedom to do that but gracefully stepping back. As many have said, you don't get to have your cake and eat it too. 
There isn't much more to say on the matter. I said I was leaving, and I did it. Here's to hoping 2024 is my year! 

My husband [28M] and I [29F] have been together for 9 years, married for 7. We got a not so classic shotgun wedding to give ourselves better chances of receiving custody of his half sister [10F] when their mom suddenly passed away. Despite only being 20 and 21 years old, we did receive full legal custody over her absent father. This information isn't super relevant to the current situation, but it really sets the tone of our relationship with the sacrifices we made together and  the things we each had to give up personally to raise this beautiful little girl. We don't have any children together, but his sister is now 17 and moved in with an older, more financially privileged aunt last year.
Over the past year of this newfound alone time, I feel like we have flourished each personally and as a couple. We never fight, arguments are rare and we are pretty good at coming to understandings and apologizing when necessary. Basically, I feel we had a pretty healthy relationship. We each do little things for each other. I receive flowers no less than 10 times a year. We go on little vacations together and are generally really good. I guess a bit of the spark was sputtering out for a while, but I feel like that's normal for a relationship as long as ours. 

Fast forward to this past October. My husband seems like he has been depressed, which is normal for this time of year because of the timing of losing both his mom and dad in different years around the same time. The holidays are tough for him, so I get it and try to be there for him. He had previously planned a suicide attempt because of family issues before we met, so I take his mental health very seriously. He sits me down to have a serious conversation and starts it by saying he wants to open up our relationship. I felt my heart drop to my stomach but stayed silent and let him talk. He doesn't go into why, just jumps right into rules and explains how he wants me to find someone first before he starts looking for someone himself. When I ask him why, he couldn't explain it and fumbled his words. I asked him if he already had someone in mind for himself, and of course he denies it. I couldn't help it, I definitely blew up. I was totally blindsided by this proposal. I slept on the couch after my outburst, and he didn't even try to come after me to explain anything which kind of made me feel worse. I had never felt so unwanted in my life than in that moment. 
I have never given the impression that I was the kind of girl to be open to that kind of relationship. I will never judge anyone for wanting to live that kind of life, but it's just not for me. He went to work the next day, but I had the day off and really thought about my situation. After crying for hours, I came to the realization that this was the end for our marriage. Even suggesting an open marriage was a deal breaker for me, I realized. While he was still at work, I moved all his stuff out of our bedroom into his sister's old room, technically a spare room now. He comes home from work, ready to talk it out. After talking through more of why he wants this I've come to realize several things.
1. He is way kinkier than he let's on, and is disappointed with our bedroom life. He knows I'm not on the same level and doesn't want to push me past my boundaries to try things he knows I won't like. When I asked how he knows I won't like to try these new things, he explains they are an escalation of things he already knows I'm not down for but won't go into specifics. He also is unhappy with how infrequently we have sex but has never really put an the effort to change anything regarding it. Just complained over and over and expected me to just be ""ready"" to do the deed any minute of the day.
2. He feels we have nothing in common now that his sister is gone. For context, he is more of the outdoorsy type whereas I like to stay inside and read or play video games. I do venture out once in a while to do things he likes together and do genuinely enjoy them myself when I go like kayaking and skiing. I do understand that it isn't as often as he would like, though.
3. Because we got married so young, there are a lot of things neither of us really got to experience or try (mostly sexually). He is mourning the loss of his young 20's and never getting to sleep around and explore his kinks.
4. Part of the rules he explained was that we wouldn't technically be sleeping around with whoever we wanted. He called it an open marriage but described it more as polyamory. Where we would each have a boyfriend or girlfriend of our own that we went on dates and did things together. Someone we were each allowed to love and be with sexually. An emotional connection was pivotal for him, which broke my heart to pieces....

During our talk, I told him I would never be able to look at him the same. I would never be enough for him, and he was basically trying to get a pass for guilt free cheating in my eyes. I told him it sounded like he wanted to be with someone else without ever leaving the comfort of his marriage. Knowing he could date around and not worrying if those relationships would fail because he could just come home to me. He tried  denying these things, saying he wanted to explore himself sexually but didnt want to lose me in the process. He tried getting me to agree to marriage counseling to talk about the open marriage concept. I told him just proposing an open marriage was grounds for divorce for me, and I wasn't willing to go to a counselor for them to gang up on me to try to bully me into trying it. I know in reality that never would have happened, but emotions were high in the moment. Because I told him I could never see him the same and how badly this crushed any self confidence I may have had, he doubled down. He said if we go back into a relationship and pretend this never happened then he would end up cheating on me. For him, it was open marraige or nothing. 

I chose nothing.

 Divorce papers were filed exactly 1 week later. He was very hurt (angry) that I could jump right to divorce and kick him out of our bedroom so fast. But I refuse to be a second choice or have to fight for his attention. I can't believe he is okay with the idea of another person being inside of me. He is willing to just give me up to explore his options? I can't believe I wasted so much of my time with him. Helping him heal his family and raise his sister; I feel completely used.

Advice?
Did I overreact? Should I have waited longer before filing for divorce? Should I have just gone to marriage counseling, or was my gut instinct correct about the marriage being over? I still love and care about him, but my brain is screaming to be logical. We still live together while we are trying to figure out how to split everything but now he is being super toxic and petty, saying hurtful things and then begging for personal details about my life. I need to get out of this house. How do I cope with these complicated feelings?


TLDR: My husband blindsided me with wanting an open marriage, so I moved him to our spare bedroom while he wasn't home and filed for divorce a week later.",1701654718.0,huntybum,relationship_advice
My (29F) husband (37M) said he's disappointed because I can't give him a daughter.,"We always talked about children and we both always said that we wanted to have all girls, but we ended up having six boys (8) (7) (5) (3) (2) (one month) and I don't care because the only thing that matters to me is that they are all healthy, but apparently my (29F) husband (37M) doesn't think that way, because exactly a month ago we had another boy and he felt disappointed.We decided to wait until he was born to find out his gender and when he was born my husband just laughed and that was it, it is obvious that he loves him and is happy with him, and he's an amazing dad to be honest but he still feels disappointed.

Two weeks ago I was using his computer, where he has his WhatsApp connected, and I accidentally read a chat that he was having with his brother where he told him that he was disappointed that I couldn't give him a daughter, he said that he loves our children and doesn't regret having them but that he still dreams of having a daughter and that it saddens him to know that we will probably never have one, that sometimes he thinks about what would have happened if he stayed with his ex-girlfriend (she currently has three girls) and honestly reading that made me feel really bad, because there is nothing I can do to determine the gender of our baby, and because it is horrible to know that he is still thinking about someone with whom he has not had a relationship for more than a decade.

That same day I talked to him about it and he apologized and said that he shouldn't have said anything he said, that he loves our children and me and that saying that about his ex was crossing the line and he apologized for that too, but I still have a bittersweet feeling, it's like everything he said is stuck in my head and I can only think about it. I didn't bring it up again because I don't want to look stupid, but I feel so sad and depressed and I haven't stopped feeling that way since I read those messages. How can I forget what he said? Is it normal to think about what would have happened if you stayed with your ex-partner?


EDIT: I didn't expect this to get so much attention but I think not everyone is reading the whole post, I already talked to him about it and he apologized and said he loves us no matter what. Also I don't know why are y'all saying that he's a bad father because that's not true, he's the best dad I could ever ask for our children. And I won't say that he ""helps"" me, because fulfilling his role as a father is not ""helping"", it is doing what he SHOULD do, and so far I can't complain because he is amazing at being a father and a husband, so I don't know why you say he wants to leave me when I only wrote a few paragraphs and you don't even know us.
And saying that someone is ""creepy"" or has creepy reasons for wanting to have a daughter is so stupid, you don't even know him, so stop projecting how you feel about women onto him. 

ps: You guys are right about only one thing, he's really bad at biology, he wanted to be a doctor when he was a teenager but he couldn't get into med school so he ended up being a lawyer lmao",1697501739.0,Throwra_bett,relationship_advice
I (39F) broke up with my Muslim (36M) boyfriend after finding out we’re pregnant. Can anyone provide advice/thoughts on how to get through this difficult time?,"My now ex boyfriend (36) and I (39, female) started dating about 9 months ago. He is Muslim and I am a non practicing Catholic. We fell in love early on in the relationship and throughout all those months we were happy and really cared about each other. He called me the love of his life. He would come over my place and sleepover often on weekends I didn’t work. There were a few disagreements but we would talk about it and be understanding. I was his first girlfriend and he hasn’t dated before. He mentioned he hadn’t dated bc he was focusing on establishing his IT career which I can understand. I had dated and had had prior relationships that ran their course and ended. So the issue now is that after being many days late past my period I decided to take a pregnancy test and found out I am pregnant. He and I spoke and I told him that we are pregnant and he was in major shock. I was nervous too, still am as this is my first pregnancy and have no idea what to expect. He eventually mentioned that his family will not approve of this and if I could terminate and he can introduce me to his family and then eventually marry and then do things the right way. I told him terminating is not an option for me and that if I were ever blessed to get pregnant I would never abort. I told him to stop telling me to terminate and to respect my decision. He said this would bring shame and a bad name to his family. I told him that the only thing then that can come off of this is that I carry on alone and as a single future mother and not involve him so his family doesn’t find out. He’s not going to own his part to his family I am sure of this so I broke up and ended things with him. It has been very sad for me and so surreal to think that I am pregnant (I am about 6 weeks pregnant). I understand this is a sin in his culture/religion but it happened and it makes me really sad and mad at times thinking how he is okay with leaving me and his unborn child to the side and forgotten all so he can maintain a good picture to his family. I get that it is a fragile subject on both ends but I am super upset. I just hope that I can figure things out on my own and am able to have a healthy pregnancy in my age and am able to be a good mother to my baby as a single mother. Any advice or thoughts? Thank you to all that took the time to read this post. ",1730754167.0,Detail_Worried,relationship_advice
Husband (34M) says he regrets marrying me (32F) due to my lack of physical activity: where do we go from here?,"Hey everyone, I'm 32F married to 34M. We've been married 4 years and have a beautiful 2 year old 2M.

For our whole relationship, my level of physical activity has been a problem topic. My husband is very physically active. He used to play soccer (had to stop due to an injury), walks, bikes, hikes, etc. When we met, I also was reasonably physically active, but doing totally different activities (yoga, dance). We got married during COVID and I got pregnant relatively quickly. During pregnancy and since we’ve had our baby (now active, running-around-all-the-time toddler) I admit my physical activity has dropped to just functional things like childcare and walking around and running after our kid. I’ve done the odd dance workshop but am definitely not doing any regular scheduled exercise each week. I am of average weight (BMI in normal range) and am net 8 pounds heavier than I was when my husband and I met. In the 4 years we’ve been married, besides pregnancy and postpartum, I’ve also had another minor abdominal surgery. 

Every few months, my husband and I will have a conversation in which he expresses that he’s quite upset that my level of physical activity is so low, and that he wishes we were doing more active things together. Specifically, he’d love to hike more together. Hiking has never been an activity I’ve enjoyed — and since we’ve been married my husband hasn’t been hiking much either although he used to do a lot more of it before. 

A couple weeks ago, we had this conversation again, and he said if he’d known this is where we’d be 4 years after marriage, and if he’d known this would be my baseline level of physical activity, he would have reconsidered getting married (our sex life has been dead postpartum, and I think it’s due to this). My reaction was that (1) I am healthy and normal, and not on track for any kind of adverse outcome due to my health, (2) we have a good relationship other than this one point: he’s a great and involved dad, we live in a beautiful place in a house we love, and I bring a lot to the table (make as much if not more $ than him, am a great mom, am loving and caring and kind to him). 

His reaction was that being of average health isn’t enough — his expectation in a partner is that they be of above-average health and activity, and he’s not willing to reconsider that, but he does want to work on our marriage and relationship. For my part, I agree that I used to do more when we met, but it doesn’t seem right that there’s no allowance for the fact that in the 4 years we’ve been married, it’s been COVID, pregnancy, postpartum, and another surgery for me. I do wish I was more physically active but I don’t know if I’ll meet my husband’s standards even if I tried. 

Our marriage feels like it’s on the rocks, and my self esteem is really low at this point. Where do we go from here?",1717333053.0,ThrowRAphys_activity,relationship_advice
My (25F) husband (27M) wants me to lose more weight before we try to get pregnant. How do I move forward?,"We’ve been married just over five years, and although we are young, we are in a stable situation (financially and in our relationship) where we both would like to get pregnant in the next year or so.

At my heaviest weight in 2020 (155 pounds 5’3”) he expressed that he wanted me to lose weight to help him be more attracted to me. Although this was hard to hear we had a constructive conversation and I understood where he was coming from. I’ve put in an effort to lose weight and am down 25 pounds since that original convo (I am on the high end of being “healthy” according to the BMI scale). 

We’ve been talking more seriously about trying for a baby, but he’s expressed that he still doesn’t find me fully attractive and would like me to be 120 pounds before we officially start trying to get pregnant.

I have previously expressed that it would be cool to be 120 pounds, but I don’t think being 120 pounds is necessary before we start trying for a baby since I am a healthy weight, work out every day and overall have a good diet. To be a good sport I’ve been trying to lose more weight since our more recent convos, but have been stagnant around 132 pounds.

I would like to start trying for a baby now, but he still wants to wait until I’m 120 pounds (which feels like it could never happen). 

How would you recommend moving forward? As I said - I want to start trying for a baby asap, but also don’t want to disappoint my husband.

Note: My husband and I love each other very much, and every time he talks to me about my weight he is straightforward but also very kind and clearly loves me / wants the best for me. ",1717958469.0,ThrowRA_friendlydog,relationship_advice
"Thought we built a perfect relationship, WTF? My M(41) wife (F37) of 10 years (12 together) out of the blue decided she wasn't in love anymore and wants to ""YOLO"" it. She is moving out next month. We have a 3 year old boy. Where to go from here? What am I overlooking?","Background: We are in the US, MCOL major east coast city. We own a house and a car.  Income is jointly 200k+, split more of less equally. Expenses are divided equally. Both have Masters degrees. Political and ethical values are almost exactly aligned across all subjects. We have a normal social circle (somewhat diminished by COVID) with regular interactions, weekly brunches, sports watching, game nights etc. I am on great terms with her family, her mother and brother visit 3-4 times a year and stay with us. My parents visit 5-6 times a year a stay with us as well. As far as I can tell she is on good terms with them as well. Both of our parents and relatives are extremely supportive and friendly. Life has been on basically easy mode for the last 5 years, which is ironically one of her complaints: ""We are just coasting"". We are doing great financially, maxing out (401k) and saving for our kids education. We are both calm and rational. Fight frequency is around 3 times per year and manifests itself as us just taking time and space apart for a few days and everything goes back to normal. There is no yelling, or physical violence, or any discomfort. It's more of a ""I need some space to myself right now"".

Last month my wife announced she is leaving next month. This came as a complete shock to me. At first I thought it was a joke, then an attempt to get me to do something, then the realization she was serious. I have attempted everything I can think of to find an avenue of moving forward together but all has fallen on deaf ears. I offered counseling, taking time apart, seeing other people romantically, a period of focusing of treating each other with special care and affection, etc. Everything has been dismissed without any thought. Furthermore, I'm not getting a further explanation than ""I'm not in love anymore"". Ok, now admittedly the intensity of the romantic feelings have declined, but I thought this was just the natural cycle of being married. Intense romantic attraction over time transforms into something more stable with age. A form of love where companionship, friendship, non physical affection take an increasingly more prominent role as the relationship ages and I was ok with it. Until very recently we still had a healthy sexual life (about 10 times per week). I find her attractive and it came as a complete shock when she announced seemingly out of nowhere that she wasn't sexually attracted to me anymore. We had disagreements in the past about the sex frequency and settled on 2.5 hours per week whenever possible of sexy time devoted entirely to us. At some point she started making jokes about how my sexual drive is supposed to slow down at this point and maybe I should find a younger woman to satisfy me. I thought this was just playful banter. 

  
It is my personal belief that a good relationship is based on the quality of the experiences people have together. Earlier in the relationship, we traveled all across the world, taking a month of vacation per year to exotic places. We ran marathons together, played video games together, cooked together, did yoga together, etc. The nature of our experiences together was always overwhelmingly positive. When we decided to have kids we came to an agreement that we'd stay together no matter what until they were 18, this is part of the reason I feel betrayed now. I realize it's a stupid thing to agree to, but it made sense at the time. **Since she got pregnant everything changed, our relationship didn't just not take priority, it fell out of the top 10.** Work, childcare, her personal hobbies, her extended family all of a sudden became more important. I was cognizant of this change and tried to implement special time for us alone together, but was met with lukewarm responses at best. She was dragging her feet on everything, making it seem that usual things like attending a friends wedding was all of a sudden a great favor she was doing for everyone. I tried my best to suggest things for us to do together, but increasingly got rejected more and more. Fine. I thought this was just a phase. We'll tough it out and recapture the magic as our kid gets older. I should say that she has been acting depressed, not enjoying life, complaining about work more and more. One complaint she had since our kid was born was lack of support in childcare. In the first 2 years, our child preferred the company of his mother, I thought this was normal and understandable. We tried multiple times for me to give him baths, get him dressed, but he would always start crying and ask for his mother. Since he became 3, he increasingly wants to spend time with me more and more. So while asking for more help, my wife refused offers for me to make school lunches, get him dressed for school, and walk him to school and back. I'm lost on how to proceed. 

Goal #1: Discover and work towards a future in which we stay together as a family. 

Goal #2: If goal #1 is not possible, work towards the best possible future for our kid.

"I 22F and my bf 35M, he said he will only be with me if he can get my inheritance m. What will I do?","I and my ex have been on and off for a year, recently we have been back on good terms and was working towards a healthy relationship. I recently moved back in with my elderly father (who is a night mare to live with) since he wasn’t doing to well. So I brought my ex over a couple times to see where I was staying. I live in a seven bedroom, three story house and ever since seeing the house my ex has been giving me an ultimatum. He said the only way we could be together is if I secure the house since my father split it between me and my 50F sister. 

My ex wants me to inherit the entire thing and to ensure my sister gets nothing. He has become so insufferable he said it’s either I inherit the house because I should provide somewhere secure for our future. I told him that’s he’s 35 years old with nothing and a whole daughter and he has nothing to show for it. Did I go to far, let me know 

UPDATE: 
I have read every single comment and just thought I’d clarify, I broke up with him before I made that post. My father and I doesn’t have the best relationship so I’m not sure why my ex was so hellbent on making sure my still VERY ALIVE dad gives me everything. Secondly my sister and I have two different moms!

Mother '60F' and daughter '42F' are suddenly estranged and Mother does not completely understand why this has happened. Mother is looking for insight as to how to fix the situation?,"I '60F'raised my daughter '42F' as a single Mom. So, that means we have known each other for 42 years. When she was little I worked in a diner during the day, and I catered on weekends to make ends meet. I did have help from my parents thank god, or I don't know what I would have done. My uber intelligent daughter graduated high school with high marks and got accepted to our state's most elite university. I was able to work enough extra shifts to supplement her needs (books, groceries, movies, gas, etc.), but she did take loans and grants. She graduated college, has gone on to become an extremely popular third grade teacher and also married the district's school psychologist. She has also given birth to my two most precious grandchildren who I would literally die for. We have always been close. She was a model child, we rarely disagreed and my mother, she, and I were like three peas to a pod.

Fast forward to more recent events. After she finished her education, I decided to return to school and earn my bachelors and masters degree. I had left the catering business when my mother became chronically ill and spent the next eight years caring solely for her. My income was from her and school grants. A year ago my mother passed away. Since that time I have struggled to find work and I am still in school full-time, but now I have half the income and double the expenses because Mom and I split those. In short, I have really struggled to stay in my current place.

A couple of months ago, after receiving 3 job rejection emails in one day, I called my daughter to commiserate and when I was done, I said ""I'm just not sure what I should do at this point"". To which she said, ""I don't know, but there is no place for you with me, so you need to figure it out."" I was instantly shocked because I'm not sure that I meant for her to take me in, but okay let's explore what you mean by that, because surely push come to shove, she wouldn't let me be homeless. But, she reiterated, ""you cannot come to my home regardless of your circumstances Mom, you need to figure it out.""'

I hung up the phone on her because I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest. I don't think that I was contemplating moving in with her, but the fact that she didn't care that I would live on the street was suffocating me. I would NEVER let a relative live on the street, not alone my mother. After calming down, I called her and said, I think we need to talk this out because my feelings are so hurt that I'm afraid it is going to really hurt our relationship. She said, ""I've noticed that things are getting more challenging for you and I have been up front in warning you that I was not taking you in."" Well, I must have missed that memo.  In hindsight, she did ask me things like, ""what are you going to do if things don't turn around?"" and she did say while chuckling once, ""if worse comes to worse, you aren't coming with me"". I thought she was joking because it wasn't even what we were talking about at the time.

Upon hearing that she would see me in the streets, I started to make back-up plans knowing that she wasn't going to be a source of any temporary support for me. I contacted my sister, brother, and aunt who all were shocked because that is not how our family has ever operated. Of course all three said, come here. Of course all three have drawbacks like the distance it will put between me and my beloved grandchildren. Well, my sister who was livid and also close to my daughter, called my daughter (unbeknownst to me) out on her behavior. She asked her how on earth she could let her Mom be homeless, if it actually came to that. My daughter said, she won't be homeless, she has you guys. My sister said, yes, but then she won't be near the grandbabies. My daughter said, ""well, sometimes sacrifices have to be made.""

\*side note: I am the ONLY grandparent in their lives as they (her psychologist husband and her), alienated his parents ten years ago and haven't spoken to ANY of his family since. The grandbabies do not know-nor have ever met a single person from his side.

Anyway, since the phone call with my sister, my daughter refuses to talk to me. I honestly have not made efforts to reach out to her much because when I do, she doesn't answer or has her husband answer my inquiries. I have been able to continue a relationship with the grands, but I have to go through the son-in-law to arrange it. My grandson is so attached to me because I was his primary care giver until kindergarten while his parents worked. I was already caring for Mom so it was no problem to care for him too. They did start giving me $300.00 a month starting the second or third year of watching him, which I appreciated. The point being, it will destroy him as much as me if I have to move to another state.

So, I have managed to stay in this apartment that I can't afford with school money, maxing out credit cards, refinancing my car, some gig work, and selling items on eBay. I am frantically putting out resumes etc. to try and stay close to the grandbabies. Yesterday was Mother's Day. I received a generic ""happy mother's day"" message in a group text and that was it. Not a boo the rest of the day. In our family Mother's Day, is huge. Brunch, flowers, cards, acknowledgment.  I didn't even know the group text included me because the first name was not mine so I thought it was sent by someone on accident.  I later texted her and said something to the effect of ""although things are strange right now, I did want to wish you a Happy Mother's Day today and thank you for bringing my two precious grandbabies into the world"". To which she replied, ""i included you in a group text at 9 a.m. this morning, I'm sorry if you did not see it."" Direct quote. I responded, ""how personal, thank you. kiss the babies. hope you are all having a great day. enjoy the sunshine. Her response: nothing.

I'm not sure where to go from here.  I am heartbroken.  I want to return to the close relationship we had before, but I am also so disappointed in what has transpired.  She knows that I am struggling financially, grieving my mother, scared, and basically alone.  I get that none of that is her doing.  I guess I just expected more compassion and grace from her.  In any case, I am at a loss of how to fix this.  I want reconciliation, but I also do not want to grovel for scraps of her attention.  Looking for advice on whether or not I should keep trying or move on.  Thank you.

\*\*\*\*To update this post, it's after midnight here but I have spent this evening reading the Missing Missing Reasons, that was suggested to me and also reflecting on the constructive posts. After reading through all of it,  I understood that my perception of her childhood, the situation we are in now, and the journey to getting here are most likely very different.  I wanted to know her perception and how to move forward to healing.  I decided to call her on the off chance that she would answer and surprisingly she did.  I began by apologizing to her for overwhelming her with my issues and that I understood her need to have boundaries and that I would work on extricating myself from her orbit.  I apologized if any of my actions came off to her as passive aggressive, I wasn't trying to except for my petty mother's day message, but that doesn't make it less inflammatory or hurtful, so I'm sorry.  I asked her to tell me what I could do differently going forward to try and repair what has been done. 

Her response:  (I'm paraphrasing) Mom, to be honest.  This has blown up to be much bigger than it needed to be.  I am going through some stuff of my own. Stuff I'm not comfortable talking about right now, and stuff at work, stuff with the kids, and when you complained about the job rejections it was the straw that broke the camels back.  I just blew up.  I didn't feel like listening to one more person's complaints or whining and so I just blurted out fix it, you aren't coming here.  She said, I mean that.  You aren't coming here, but I could have said it in a more loving manner.  I asked her if I had just ignored her telling me that in the past and she said, ""yes and no"".  I've eluded to it, but I'm at fault too for not just slamming it on the table.  

She went on to say that in reality this situation would have just been a call from her to me the next day to say hey sorry about my crappy mood, but in the interim her Aunt calls her and tells her what a horrible child she is and immediately her IDGAF shield is up and she's burrowed in now.   She said, ""I get that I could have been gentler in the delivery, but people need to mind their business, and you should have protected my position with her.""   

I asked her about her childhood and if she had trauma that I wasn't aware of and she said, ""How can anyone escape childhood without trauma Mom?  I lost a brother, I lost grandparents, I lost friends, nasty crap happens"".  I asked her if it was the void of a father and she laughed and said, she never once felt that void.  She said she had her grandpa and uncles and they were the only male presence she needed. I asked her if she was happy in her childhood, and she said, with 100 percent certainty Mom, you gave me the best childhood.  I will never complain about that.  Now if we are talking later, then I will say that we have had some issues with healthy boundaries and although our family has always operated a certain way that we accept and are used to, my husband is not.  I have to consider his feelings in all things and his feelings are that we need to have a healthy space between us.  I would love for all of us to live in one big house like the Walton's, but he isn't wired like that and I have to respect his wishes first and foremost because he is my family.  

I asked if she thought my grandparenting was overly intrusive or obsessive and she said ""yes, and I love it, don't ever change that"".  ""You can ease up on the parenting of me, but never the grandparenting of them"".  She went on to tell me how much her grandparents consistent presence impacted the positivity in her self esteem, and self image and she wanted the same for hers. 

I asked about my returning to school and if that bothered her and felt like I was wasting my time and she said, ""absolutely not!""  ""I'm so proud of you for doing that"".  ""It was so far outside your comfort zone and you took a leap of faith, and I support you 100 percent.""  She said she thought it was a great idea and that's why she suggested it.  I said, maybe I should have put gram in a home and just got a regular job.  She said, Mom who knew grandma was going to be sick for so long?  You are an awesome daughter, and gram was lucky to have the love and care you gave her.  I am just saying up front that I don't think that is in my wheelhouse.  I'm sorry, it isn't for me.  I am sure glad it was in you because I would hate for gram to have gone to a home. 

So, we have agreed to meet for lunch soon, not real soon.  We agree to set and honor healthy boundaries and I am going to work on my own emotional attachment issues and step back from their orbit.  I want to thank everyone who had strong, harsh, blunt, yet constructive criticism.  I wouldn't have had the nerve to call or admit my mistakes without reflecting on your valid points of view, so thank you, so so much. 

I was thinking of asking her to come on and repeat herself, but then I thought all of the naysayers on here will just accuse me of impersonating her, so what would be the point?  Still, I want you to know that for those of you who wanted to twist my words, inject seedy innuendo, false narratives, and paint me as a complete degenerate,  I still took your points of view into consideration too. 

Peace to you all and thanks again.  Goodnight, or good morning really. ",1716226552.0,Odd_Pack9574,relationship_advice
I don’t know if I’m in a healthy relationship. Opinions? (M37-F32),"M37/F32
I’ve been on vacation with my family in a different country and my partner back home has been a mess. He gets upset and mad if we don’t talk at a specific time and has taken my family time as a sign that I plan on breaking up with him. He’s been drinking everyday since I’ve been gone. He’s cried. He’s constantly asked if I was going to break up with him when I get home. He’s gotten upset that I’ve been spending time with my family (that I haven’t seen in a year). His self esteem is so low. He makes me feel like crap if I don’t talk or answer his questions. Last night, he drove off, intoxicated, and messaging me that made me almost calling family members because I was worried about his state of mind. Also, his daughter called me, crying, begging me not to break up with her dad. I don’t know what to do when I get back. My family is upset that he’s been making me upset. So I’m debating on what to do when I return. Is this healthy? I am having someone else pick me up at the airport. I don’t know what to do.",1691314876.0,Alikhaleesi,relationship_advice
My(M30) wife(F26) has returned 1 year after leaving to find herself. How stupid am I for considering taking her back?,"My wife and I got married 6 years ago. I proposed to her after 4 months of dating and we were married 3 months later. You could call it quick, and I’m not saying it wasn’t, but it felt right. So it was me, my wife, and my son (who is now 8).

Things were great. We found out we were expecting our first child together and we were over the moon. Sadly, our baby was stillbirth and that started the fast decline of our relationship. It sent her into an extreme depression. It was like nothing could help it, and I was watching my beautiful wife die while still being perfectly physically healthy. By the next few months, instead of waking up to her next to me, I woke up to a note, of her telling me she was going to clear her head. One week, no response. Before I knew it, she came back—and retrieved half of her stuff. I was blocked on everything.

It hurt, you know? I lost my baby and my wife left me in a matter of 2 months I went into a pretty deep depression while also having to shun it away from my son. Things we’re hard. I was pretty much on auto pilot and became severely underweight. It just started feeling good, getting back into society with closer connections to good friends. My wife never came back during that time period, and I was just wondering when I’d be hit with the divorce papers.

And you want to know who showed up at my doorstep at 5am this weekend? My wife. There were so many things I wanted to say to her. I wanted to know if she was okay, I wanted to beg her to come back, but at the same time I wanted to tell her to leave and never come back. She came in and said that she spent the last 8 months 300 miles away and said she wanted to work on us.

I smiled. We almost had sex. I took a good look in the mirror and I couldn’t believe how stupid I was being. She came back expecting me to welcome her back with open arms, and that’s exactly what I did. I empathize with her deeply and I saw how bad everything affected her, but 1 year. It felt unforgivable. I told her she needed to leave and now we’re here and I’m on Reddit, asking how do I proceed?",1705370502.0,throwratu449,relationship_advice
I (37F) suspect infidelity because I found condoms. Husband (38M) and I have not used condoms in years. What do I do next?,"UPDATE 06 Aug 2024
TLDR I found a ereceipt for the rubbers. They are his, no other *obvious* signs of infidelity 

Hello all
Sorry it’s a long one

It’s been a little while. RIP my inbox, I read so many comments and messages; many or most of them were helpful. I was so shocked and frightened that I just could not think calmly or what to do next, all of you helped me, you really did and I am thankful.

Last week I had probably one of the most horrendous days of my life. Let me try to explain a bit more clearly what happened and what’s happening. I won’t give exact details to preserve anonymity.

I was away from my husband 38M and 3 kids for almost 6 months. This was because I had to go with my sister to help our mum. She had a severe stroke and was not expected to make it, my sister was in pieces (she still spoke with mum even though I didn’t). Husband encouraged me to stay, he helped pay for ticket.

Originally I was only supposed to stay there to pretty much help bury her and then come back after a few weeks. However she’s surprised us all by staying alive and recovering somewhat, anyway there were still complications with her recovery physically mentally financially and I could not leave. I did not want to go in the first place, I did not want to stay and I sure as shit didn’t want to deal with her. I had not spoken or seen my mother in about 17 years because of her addiction issues. I never thought I’d ever see her again and I had massive emotional trauma to deal with.
But you know what? I’m glad I went. I faced my demons and showed compassion I did not know I was capable of, whilst I shall never be buddy buddy with mum, it has done good for my psychological/mental health.

And I realise now… my mental health has been shit. For years. Even before the kids were born. My husband tried to help but I was stuck fast wallowing in a depressed funk, I blamed my mum for my poor mental health and let myself go (physically and mentally).

For years I’d been sinking further and further down and yes it affected my relationships particularly with my husband.

My husband is a hard working insightful generous man. He has always supported me, never laid a finger on me and I feel safe around him. He is and always has been an excellent father. He has his faults, don’t we all?  But I love him and I know he loves me.

When I came back from my journey of rediscovery, my husband was expecting ‘the old me’. The depressed miserable bitchy moany not-sexy pessimistic me. I admit it to myself and it’s a hard pill to swallow - I think back at how I treated myself and my husband, the awful negative thoughts I had and I am ashamed.

Needless to say in all these years our physical/sex life was in the pits. Our marriage was crap. I admit it and I’ve cried all the tears I’ve had crammed up these past 17 years since I locked my hurt and pain away with my mother’s abandonment and abuse. 

I lost weight on my trip (almost 15kgs!) I’m off my antidepressants and eating healthy (without even trying!) In the past few months I’m actually interested in the day and what it brings, I’m present for my children and I feel like I’m in control.

However, when I came back I had to not exactly grovel, but a big apology/explanation was owed and it was hard to get the words out but I said them and I meant them.

I was unpacking drawers and I found condoms. I have an IUD and we haven’t used rubbers in years and years. The expiry date on these condoms was 2027 so not a chance they were old. I am a bit shamed to say I did discreetly search his email/messges and found the receipt for them in Amazon, he did buy them about 1 month ago. Only one is missing and I noticed the toys had been moved so I am certain that he used it on himself. I did search for other suspicious items etc but there were none.
I did check messages and there is nothing suspicious. Nothing at all. My husband hasn’t been behaving suspicious and I think when I confronted him with the condoms I found he just blurted out a bs excuse and because of the distance between us he wouldn’t admit using them on himself (yet).

I also had a look at our finances and I am ashamed to see how hard my husband has been working to keep a roof over our heads. Nothing suspicious going on and we are lucky to have him so committed. I have sadly heard in other comments about how some people just dump the partner with kids when it gets too tough.

The fear I felt in that moment, that yes, he was cheating, was overwhelmingly real. I can see how my refusal to get help, not be physical and always a moany cow could push him away. I don’t see him starting another relationship, but I could see him maybe using a service. Maybe? I dunno.

So Will I throw away 15+ good years (mostly) away for this? No. I am going to do the best I can because these past years have been pretty fucking awful and he has been working so damn hard and I have just been… consumed with self loathing. I know I know I can’t take the blame for absolutely everything that’s gone wrong. However I’m starting with what I can. I have for the first time in a looooong time felt actually excited about what I can do with the future.

BUT I will definitely 100% be getting a job to make myself self sufficient. Cheating/divorce isn’t the only way a partner can leave you and this whole event has shown me a warning shot that I need to get a grip and find a job. I have also started some online courses to brush up on skills I haven’t used in years. I’ve updated my cv again (using AI software what a trip!) and I in fact already have an interview set up 2 weeks from now.

AND I will also discreetly consult a lawyer/citizens advice bureau to find out the ‘what if’ we get divorced because knowledge definitely is power.

And I must explain that I didn’t cry my eyes out and terrify the children like some comments suggested. There is no trauma, they’re fine and I’ve gotten a hold of myself. I cried once or twice coming out the bathroom and then went for a long ass walk to cry and try get hold of myself.

So… one condom missing from a box seems to be the catalyst for my life. Made me look at what is actually of value.

Whatever happens, I know I’ll be fine. I realise now how difficult things have been for my husband and how I wasn’t helping at all. The shame still makes me cry and I am hoping that’s a good thing actually, because I year ago I wouldn’t have given a shit, just would have done some more self-destructive behaviour probably. 

Thank you all for your comments. Really. I really mean it, a lot of them helped me shake some sense into me and allow for self-reflection.

It is early days yet, but I am hopeful. My husband was smiling at me across the room the other day after I had done something for him and it’s the first time in ages I saw that. He said something flirty and I felt butterflies. Not disgust and contempt like a year or two ago.

Anyway. I have rambled a lot and I’m not going to edit this. Maybe I’ll update again, maybe I won’t. But yes again thanks so much for your help.

What do I do next? How do I get a lawyer? I can’t afford one I’m a stay at home pastime time working mum with no savings. I don’t see us getting through this (he’s checked out I can feel it)
Oh god the pain the pain the pain I have never felt this pain, people driving by acting normal with their lives and I am dying agony inside.
I want to check his emails/messages but is that a bad idea? Sorry for a mess grammar I can’t see through the tears. Kids keep asking me why I’m crying 😭 
Tldr found condoms in drawer, we haven’t used condoms in years. I suspect cheating, what do I do next?

"Wife (F33) gave me (M35) an ultimatum that I can't fulfill, but it's hard to set a boundary. How do I best navigate this?","Throwaway because I fear that reddit-using friends will identify us.

So, we're together for 4 years, married for 2, and it's been rough for the past six months or so. Something about my spouse has changed - she started having really powerful and increasingly frequent emotional outbursts when something doesn't go her way, or her expectations are not met. During those she will drag me (and only me, she doesn't do that to others thankfully) down and treat me like the worst human being in the world, berating me and sometimes threatening divorce. That said, after an outburst is over, she will always apologize and outside of them she is a very supportive partner who I believe genuinely loves me and who accepts my expressions of love as well. To avoid running afoul of rule 4, I won't go into detail about her mental health, and the actual advice I want is about a more specific situation. The outbursts are just part of the context.

So, a couple of months ago I quit my job to start my own business in my field. This was something that I did after thoroughly discussing it with my wife and with her explicit encouragement. I articulated numerous times to her that the transition most likely would cause us some financial hardship for a period of six months to a year, and she always told me she would be fine with that and would also work to support us. Currently she is between jobs. Her taking up even a modest part-time job would be enough to keep us safely afloat.

Now, the same week I quit my corporate job she sat me down and told me that she wants to start trying to a baby. Like, now. When I pushed back on that and asked her to wait until my business is a little more off the ground, it led to a big fight and a divorce threat - or rather, for the first time in our relationship, a divorce ultimatum: start trying now or we're done. After she calmed down, she agreed to wait a month, which frankly is nowhere near sufficient but it is what it is. When I asked her what we're going to do if the child is born before we're financially secure, her response was that she'll get jobs, I'll get more jobs, her family will help with childcare, and we'll pull through. Not easy, but okay, if we both work, if we both commit to it, it's doable.

The transition to running my own outfit started better than I expected and I was able to make a slightly bigger chunk of money at the start than we planned for. Still, this doesn't change the fact that I need my wife's financial support during this stage. And yet, just a few days ago, during another outburst caused by an unrelated issue she suddenly told me that she doesn't feel secure with me anymore, doesn't believe I can succeed independently, and (and that part was the real kick in the stomach) doesn't want to balance childcare with work and so wants to be a SAHM for the first 2-3 years of our child's life. And finally, she gave another ultimatum - secure a ""sufficient"" (she declined to name a sum) income by the end of next year, or we're done, regardless of whether we're parents by then or not. After she came back to her senses she did apologize and claimed she ""didn't mean"" what she said, but I haven't quite had the courage to ask if that includes the divorce ultimatum and the SAHM part. Realistically, given the conditions she has set, I would need to be making enough by next year to provide for a SAHM wife and an infant. I'm not sure I can meet that within that timeframe - which is exactly why I wanted to wait before trying for a baby.

Now, normally ultimatums like the ones she gave me would be where I would set a hard boundary. To her last one I would say ""Honey, I would love to provide that lifestyle for you, and I plan to eventually, but getting there in one year is not something I can honestly promise. More likely than not I won't achieve that so soon. If that's a deal breaker for you, if waiting longer and/or working yourself is totally unacceptable to you now, then we might need to start thinking of separation"" As much as it would break my heart to even talk of separating, let alone actually going through with that, I believe in the importance of setting and maintaining boundaries to have a healthy relationship, and also in good old honesty and not making promises I'm not sure I can keep.  
The problem is, I'm an immigrant and depend on my wife for my residence status here (not the US). In fact, until I can secure permanent residence, which is a couple of years away, my ability to even run the business hinges on maintaining my spousal visa here. So if I set that boundary and she decides to separate, that's it, I'll be finished. My best hope would be to try to quickly get a job that can sponsor residency for me, but that's *extremely* unlikely to happen and realistically I would probably have to go back to my country of birth where none of my skill sets could land me a job and where, due to international sanctions, I wouldn't even be able to transfer any of my savings or even just carry them back as cash. I'd be destitute.  
My wife doesn't know how much I depend on her. She understands that the spousal visa affords me more freedom but doesn't quite realize how bad the consequences for me would be if I were to move back. Initially I didn't want to tell her that because I didn't want it weighing on her in case she ever considered divorcing me, and now that she's been having those emotional outbursts I'm also wary that if I told her, she might impulsively use that knowledge to do something we both might badly regret later.  
Now, many will probably ask why I chose to become so dependent on my wife. Before that, I was relying on employers to sponsor my residence in this country and going from that to my spouse, someone I was marrying because I saw her as a kind and supportive partner and the love of my life, felt like an upgrade. I trusted her more than any of my employers and generally still do. I just didn't expect that she would ever make such demands on threat of divorce. If there were any red flags I sure as hell missed them.
As it stands, it's been a few days and things between us are back to normal except obviously her ultimatum still weighs on me. So far I just can't find the courage to talk about it with her.

I'm already talking with a legal professional about my options in case she does decide to end the marriage, but my question to the sub is - how do I best navigate this going forward, if my ideal goal is to save our marriage and relationship?  So far my plan is to just sort of hope for the best and keep the current course. I understand that the outcome is not up to me only, but I'd like some outside opinions on how best to move forward - perhaps tell me what you would do in such a situation?  
Thanks in advance!",1733990944.0,Hour_Industry7887,relationship_advice
I (24F) don’t want to have sex with my bf (25M) anymore. Any advice?,"Before I start, I’d like to make it very clear that I would never act on this feeling, and that I’m looking for advice on how to get rid of this feeling. I love my boyfriend with all my heart, we genuinely have a great relationship outside of what I will mention and I do not want to break up with him.

I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for the past 3 years. We’ve always had a great relationship, the only problem has always been sex. If I’m being honest, it’s never been fulfilling and as much as I’ve tried to teach him the ways it just never works. For the past 4 months or so I find myself thinking about sleeping with other guys, which is something I’m not proud of. I would never ever cheat on my boyfriend, but at this point, I’ve been involuntarily celibate for a few months (not the first time it happened) and I know that if/when we have sex again it’s not going to be fulfilling for me (it’s enjoyable but I’d say it’s a 5/10, and that’s coming from someone with only one other experience, I imagine it’d probably be lower if someone with more experience were to rate it). He just never knows what to do with me, he doesn’t know what to do with his hands, doesn’t know foreplay, doesn’t like how I taste (I am perfectly healthy), despite me spending the past few years teaching him what would work for me. He’s not gay or asexual either and is resistant to the idea of an open relationship. 

I’ve been finding myself looking around and thinking of sleeping with other guys, which I dislike because I would never cheat on my boyfriend, I don’t want to hurt him. Because of this, I don’t know what to say to him, if I come clean about the fact that I don’t want to have sex with him anymore it’ll hurt him a lot, even more if I say I want to try other guys while keeping the relationship. 

The celibacy periods are also because he will not ever hit on me in a sexual way, I got tired of starting it every single time.

What advice would you give me? I’m very sad and desperate about the situation, my relationship is truly flawless otherwise and my boyfriend is someone I’d never ever want to lose.

Update:

I want to start by thanking everyone that gave me advice, including all the tough love comments. I’ve read pretty much every reply and gave serious thought to all of them, some of which I still keep in mind up until this point. Hearing from people in a similar situation was very eye opening and talking it over with family and friends has also helped me get to where I am today.

With all that being said, after almost 6 months from the original post, I can finally say that I have my life back and that I’m happy with where I am after breaking up with him and moving out. After I made that post and saw what everyone had to say, I tried to imagine how my life would be if I chose to continue in the relationship without making any changes, and it was a scenario I hated completely. I decided to talk it over one last time with my boyfriend (as I had mentioned somewhere in the replies, we had many talks about the problem throughout the relationship, about one every two months), saying how I couldn’t live like that and how down this made me feel. After yet another promise that would turn out to be empty, I gave it time to see if there would be any changes, which as you might’ve guessed, there wasn’t. During this waiting period, I found myself slowly detaching from the relationship and from him. I also started to feel less and less attracted towards him, my guess is that I probably anticipated how things would not change (just as they never did up until then), so I started emotionally checking out of the relationship without even noticing.

After a couple months I decided I’d seen enough, so I brought up the idea of an open relationship to him, which he was very resistant to, but said he’d think about it. I gave him the time and when he said he had an answer, he said he’d slowly stop loving me if I got physical with another guy, so I didn’t even need extra time to think and I ended it right then and there.

It’s been a little more than a month since I ended things and I feel free and happier, I knew that was taking a toll on me but I never realized just how much it was weighing me down. My self esteem is better, my daily life (even if harder because of financial reasons) is better, and I’m also finding out a lot about myself (yes, including what good sex is like). I’ve now moved as well, which was a big change but was exactly what I needed. I’m very excited about what the future holds for me, I will be taking extra time to work on myself and my goals as well.

Thank you very much to all who gave me the advice that I so badly needed to hear, it was the push that got me in the right direction!! Best wishes, B. (Green_Pasta5)",1718790759.0,Green_Pasta5,relationship_advice
Wife (32F) upset I (33M) said in front of everyone that she’s “no great beauty” either. I felt justified shutting her down given the circumstances and now we are in a bad place. How do we proceed? ,"
Wife and I have been together for 3 years. We were set up to date by our parents so it’s mostly a mix between an arranged and a love marriage. Our courtship period was 5 months and we get along well and love each other. 

However, my wife can be extremely backwards sometimes and that’s one thing I don’t like about her. Sometimes she can be rude and obnoxious (I hate how I am describing her but it’s all true) and she’d be judgy and sometimes make comments over someone’s appearance under the guise of helping them. “Oh, the dress would’ve had a much better silhouette if your waist was leaner”, “you should get your eyebrows waxed” and stuff like that when we both know that’s the person’s biggest insecurity. 

She had confessed to me once that she used to not be the nicest person back then but that was because of her own insecurities that her parents caused in her, and she projects those onto other people but she’s trying and sometimes slips up. 

Last week, my youngest cousin, 23F, who I’m very close to had dinner with us. My aunt and uncle were there, as well as my mum and dad. Now, my cousin has a scar on her face from her family dog’s attack when she was young. She did get surgery done, but those scars on her cheek are still there. Naturally, any girl would be insecure about a thing like this and my wife maybe was just being tone deaf or something and said that she can suggest my cousin the best brand of high coverage foundation that’ll “complement her skin texture”  very well, alluding to her scars. My cousin stammered a little and said she doesn’t need it and will find someone who truly loves her regardless of her scars, standing up to her. I silently cheered on my cousin and felt that the discussion was over, until my wife said that skincare and makeup does make a difference regardless. 

I was beyond frustrated at this point. Here my wife was yapping on and on and making my cousin feel ugly. I just thought she was being unbelievably cruel to her so I said; 

“Well you’re no great beauty, honey. But I married you regardless. You needn’t be concerned with her love life if it’s making you anxious. Knock it off”. This seemed to shut her up and she didn’t speak for the rest of the dinner. 


When everyone was gone, my wife yelled what the hell was that and why did I make her feel so ugly and unattractive. I told her she deserved what was coming and there’s a limit to dealing with her insecurity and the line gets drawn when she makes someone else feel insecure. How does it feel to have your own energy returned? 

This seemed to set her off and she started crying, unable to believe if that’s what I think of her. I am attracted to her and to me she’s enough but I also have a habit of trying to humble people and showing them their place which is probably where problem is in me. 


TLDR: I told my wife she's no great beauty when she insulted my cousin's appearance. My wife tends to make rude comments, especially about people's looks, due to her own insecurities. During dinner with family, she suggested makeup for my cousin's scars, so I snapped back at her. She got upset later, but I felt she needed to understand how hurtful her words can be.",1715159228.0,Throwranogreatbeauty,relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My wife gave birth to a (biracial)baby that clearly isn't mine, and I'm divorcing her. But I'm worried about the relationship between my two kids and their new half-sister."," Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/in7j0h/my\_wife\_gave\_birth\_to\_a\_blackbaby\_that\_clearly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/in7j0h/my_wife_gave_birth_to_a_blackbaby_that_clearly/)

&#x200B;

Unfortunately my last post was locked, but I received a lot of helpful PMs from people. I'm particularly thankful for those who've lived through a similar situation(or have family and friends who've done so) and sent me advice on how this affected them and how to navigate the situation. I'd also like to thank the hundreds of mouthbreathing bigots who spammed my inbox.

The big takeaway for me was that if I'd need to lead by example here, not excluding her in any way because of her paternity so that she and my sons would see her as a full member of the family. Also that I need to be more active in confronting the bigoted and ignorant nonsense I've been hearing, and teach my sons to do the same to protect their sister. I've spoken to some of those responsible since and made clear my feelings on this, and that she is to be treated as a member family, and that if I ever find out that they've said things like that to my sons or their sister that they won't be allowed around us anymore.

I've spoken to my wife about this, and we're more or less on the same page. She's been begging me to forgive her and not go through the divorce, but that's not going to happen. Even if I didn't consider the cheating unforgivable, I just dont feel any love for her any more, other then a platonic affection for her as the mother of my children. 

My sons are handling this as well as can be expected. The 4 year old doesn't fully understand, but is upset by the change in the household, thankfully he's easily distracted. The 2 year old is thankfully too young to comprehend what's going on, but has definitely picked up on how withdrawn his mother has become. They're both fascinated with their new little sister, so there's that silver lining.

My wife OTOH isn't in good shape at all. She was depressed even before the birth, and now with everything- our divorce, her infidelity being revealed and the backlash from family and friends, PPD, and the exhaustion from raising an infant- she's barely functional. She's seeing a therapist, and I've been pressuring some of our family and friends to be supportive of her because even if they think she deserves it her current state is making it harder for me and our children.

It's become very obvious to me that even after the divorce is finalized we're going to have to live together for a while longer. She's in no shape to be taking care of three kids without someone else around to support her, and I'm not willing to deprive her of her sons by seeking sole custody. It's also too difficult financially, since she's lost her job because of COVID. 

As for the baby girl, she's healthy and fairly easy by baby standards. Since I've been helping care for her, I've bonded with her and I've discussed the possibility of adopting her with my wife. She can't contact the father, as the only thing she knows about him is his first name. And given our coparenting situation it feels like adopting her as my daughter would be the best outcome for all involved-

HOWEVER, there's been a wrench thrown in that plan. It was brought to my attention that there may be a way of finding the baby's father, namely by having her DNA tested by AncestryDNA. If the father or one of his relatives has also taken the test, we may be able to find him through there DNA match database.

If I'm being completely honest I'm not happy about this. I've already started to think of the baby girl as my daughter, and having him in our lives would massively complicate the family dynamic. Plus we live in Seattle and she met him in Philadelphia, so god knows how they'd even make it work if he wanted to be the kid's father.

However, I recognize that this is a selfish reaction. If we have a chance of finding her biological father we owe it to her do so, if only so that she has access to her paternal medical history and so that she can have a relationship with him if and when she chooses to do so. I've read a few accounts by children raised by non-biological parents and a common thread is their desire to meet their lost biological parent, so thats that. We've ordered an AncestryDNA kit for her, and I guess we'll decide our next steps once we get the results back in a couple of months.",1599622785.0,ThrowRAkidilemma,relationship_advice
"yesterday I froze during sex and my girlfriend asked if we should stop, I said yes and she backed off. I've never been treated like this before.","I am 23(M) and I've been raped before. Twice. I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know. 

Next morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit. 

But she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way. 

So how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?


EDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much! 

To clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here. 

Secondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it. 

For those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now. 

And to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you. 

And for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b

My girlfriend (37F) keeps feeding me (39M) junk food despite knowing how hard I'm trying to get in shape. How do I handle this?,"So I just threw another cake in the bin. This is getting ridiculous.

This is a weird situation I'm in. I haven't been in it before and I really hate it. Basically I've been dating my girlfriend for a few years now, and I'm just getting more and more unhealthy. I used to be very physically active and took pride in my physical capabilities but it has slid since being in a relationship. I've been trying for the last year to get back in shape but my partner keeps feeding me junk food. I typically do the cooking myself, but she will pop over with cakes, surprise order pizza, or McDonalds, despite me complaining every time that I'm trying to get healthy. Even my doctor has told me I need to lose weight. For the first time in my life I'm starting to get scared about it.

My willpower isn't amazing, but I always get healthy when I am left to my own devices. Not with her though, she knows I'm trying to get healthy but does the opposite in terms of supporting my goals. I've been very direct with her about this but it isn't helping. Does anyone have any advice?

  
UPDATE:

Wow. I really didn't think this one would take off like it did. Thank you everyone for your support and interest. Although its only been less than a week so far I figured I should give you a quick update. The eve of making this post I sat with my partner and discussed how it was extremely important to me to get on top of my physical health and get in shape. I was very firm and direct about it. She understood. To be honest I think it made a positive impact on her as well because she has decided she would like to get healthier as well. This week we have both been exercising and eating clean. I'm already seeing the benefits. I'm going to stay resilient and lead by example and be open about my feelings on this. Hopefully this inspires the people close to me. It seems already to be doing so. 

  
Thanks again everyone. ",1721561534.0,ForbidddenDoughnut,relationship_advice
I (51F) am thinking of ending things with my boyfriend (52M) after a serious cancer diagnosis and treatment. How would you handle something like this?,"I (51F) have been dating my boyfriend (52M) for 7 years. We're both divorced. I have kids - mostly grown. We live in a house that I own. We have no shared property and he would never consider marriage. He is very private, independent, and quirky. I have no access to his finances. He gives me money for bills. We get along well, don't fight, and have enough in common to enjoy time together. He has never been romantic and doesn't like giving gifts or celebrating much. We both have decent jobs. We had a healthy sex life. 
I was diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer in January. It had spread to multiple organs. I asked him if he wanted to walk away before I told my friends and family I had cancer. He chose to stay and said he would never leave me. I had some initial surgeries and it was made clear that he isn't a good caregiver. He couldn't check on me, manage meds,  bring food and water. When I started chemo I arranged for other people to take me and set up a meal train to feed us. He did drive me to a number of appointments when I strictly needed a ride. I've lost all my hair. I'm tired, slow, and sick often. I had my birthday in April and my boyfriend did not give me a card or gift or do anything for me. His birthday is 3 days before mine and even though I'm sick I ordered him a gift from Amazon,  bought dinner takeout, and made him a cake. Ever since he blew off my birthday I have lost all my investment in the relationship. 
Chemo has been successful. We've known all along that if chemo worked I would have a major operation in mid-May. I got scheduled for an open hysterectomy and cancer debulking surgery on May 13th. It has a 4 week recovery time. As my surgery was approaching he scheduled himself for a knee procedure 2 days after my surgery. I expressed to him that this was bad timing and he said he didn't have a choice. He said his knee pain had suddenly grown unbearable. His knee has bothered him for the entire 7 years that we have dated and he decided that being on crutches after my surgery wasn't a conflict in his eyes. He took the week before my surgery off work and went camping and hiking. He did not take time off work to spend with me when I was recovering from surgery. He worked while I was hospitalized in another city. Then he had his knee procedure. I came home to him on crutches from an elective surgery unable to care for himself let alone me. My family and friends have been here caring for me. He asks me to do things for him when I can barely care for myself.
His Aunt called me to wish me well before my surgery and express her concern that he shouldn't have an elective procedure at the same time. She said that she believes he is having PTSD because his mom died of brain cancer when he was a teen after many years long of surgeries and treatments failed. His aunt raised him after his mom died and she said this behavior is out of character for him and she is so surprised by it.
I've lost my warm feelings for him. I think we should go our separate ways or just be friends but I feel guilty. I'm being very detached from him now and I don't like my own negativity.",1716060645.0,ThrowRAINlotus,relationship_advice
"My husband (33M), who I’ve been with for 11 years, keeps mom-shaming me (33F). What can I do to avoid separation?","I know everyone says not to make relationship decisions within the first year of having a baby. Well, our son is almost 13 months now and I STILL want to divorce his father. It’s gotten to the point where I get the ick just laying in bed with him at night. I don’t even want to get intimate because the thought of him touching me just makes me ill. Some things that I can’t get over:

1. The mom shaming. Just earlier today I wanted to bring LO to an art fest about 15 minutes walk from our apartment. I knew there would be music so I planned on bringing his headphones. Well, husband didn’t want me to go initially but then said “Now I have to go to make sure you won’t be an irresponsible mother and stand in front of the speakers”. Wtf??? I’ve never done anything like that IN MY LIFE, why would I start today? Just so unnecessary and this isn’t even the first mom-shaming incident. 

2. I’m in medical school and about to take the most important exam  of my career (USMLE Step 2) in 15 days so I’ve been pulling 16, sometimes 20 hour days just studying with some breaks in between of course. This man decides to shame me by saying now our son is too attached to my mom (who lives with us and is helping to care for our son while we’re both working). Whenever I have free time, I’m spending it with my son, but apparently this isn’t enough. 

3. Any time I make a decision that goes against what he wants, he pulls the money card. Since he’s the only one currently making money, he thinks he should have the last say on everything. I haven’t used a single cent of his money for the past year, just using my student loans and some money my mom brought with her. 

4. He has $200k+ in savings and makes about $300k/year but doesn’t want to send our son to daycare a few days a week because it’s too expensive but then complains about our son getting too attached to my mom who watches him at home, then blames me for their close relationship. I have no issues with them being close but he frequently weaponizes this against me to make me feel bad. 

5. He doesn’t know how to interact with our son without using his phone or his laptop despite knowing I want to limit screen time. 

I’m just over it at this point and counting down the days until I graduate. I’ve brought up all of this with him at one point or another but nothings changed over the past year. I honestly think my life would be easier with him out of my life and just paying child support for our son but I also don’t want to break up the family unit if I don’t have to. Just very very frustrated and tired. Part of me thinks it’s just the stress of school and new motherhood but part of me also thinks he’s a terrible husband and father. Has anyone gone through a similar frustrating patch in their parenting relationship and managed to get through it intact? Would love some advice. 

TLDR: I’m in a very stressful period in life and husband isn’t supportive enough with school and our 1-year-old son, keeps mom-shaming me. What can we do to have a healthy relationship?",1717813241.0,whowhatnowww,relationship_advice
My (47F) pregnant daughter (22F) is going to marry an incarcerated man (29M). How can I go about this situation?,"I’m concerned for my child. Yes she’s an adult but I feel like she’s making the worst decision for herself. I don’t approve AT ALL.

My daughter had good things going on for herself. She graduated high school, went to college and graduated with her associates, got accepted into dental school and all of its going down the drain because she’s chosen to invest her time and energy into her “soulmate”.

About a year ago, my daughter started writing letters to prisoners as a pen pal to keep them company. At first I was uncomfortable with the idea for many, many reasons (it never crossed my mind that she’d fallen for a criminal) but I still rented a P.O. Box for her so she wouldn’t give out her address.

My daughter was in a healthy relationship with her now ex-fiancé. They’ve been together since her senior year in high school. They just had their first child over a year ago, expecting another, and they got engaged 6 months ago. A month ago, my daughter told me that she and her fiancé were taking a break and two weeks ago she called off the engagement and left him. He’s a complete wreck. He told me it hurts that his family that he created with my daughter is now broken. He feels so blindsided as do I because I believed my daughter was truly in love but she wasn’t, she wasn’t happy.

I’ve been very supportive of my daughter during this whole situation, that is until she told me she was already in a new relationship. I was taken aback. I obviously started questioning her about it and she confessed that she had fallen for one of the prisoners she’s written to, in fact, they’ve been together for 3 months. It makes me sick to my stomach even typing this out right now because I just can’t believe it. She said they’ve been in contact for almost 8 months and since then they’ve fallen more and more in love with each other. She’s visited him multiple times, in fact she’s even taken my grandson to see this man. She’s shown me pictures of them embracing and him holding my grandchild. I’ve done some research and looked up his charges and I’m livid she even brought my grandson, even herself around someone who could do such horrible things. I’m terrified for my daughter and grandson.

I’ve tried expressing my concerns to her but she’s in a whole other world. She told me the last in person visit they had he popped the question and she said yes, that’s when I snapped. I was and am very pissed about this whole situation and she’s hurt that I’m not supportive of her decisions. She defended their relationship and her choices and we started arguing. It got so bad that now she’s not speaking to me or allowing me to see my grandbaby and it breaks my heart. I love my child but I will never approve of this relationship.

I understand that as an adult, she has the right to make her own choices, and l've always been proud of her independence. But as someone who truly loves her deeply, it's hard for me to watch her make a decision that I feel could be harmful to herself and my grandson. I'm scared for her because of what I've learned about this person's past, and I can't shake the fear of what could happen. I don't want to lose her or my grandchild to a situation that seems so risky. I don’t know what else I can do and I feel so hopeless. Please, what else can I do?

TLDR: I'm worried because my daughter, who's achieved so much, is throwing it all away for a prisoner she fell for while being a pen pal. She's left her fiancé for him, and it's hard for me to stomach or support this decision.",1717750878.0,ThrowRA-sad_mom123,relationship_advice
Update: My (30f) husband (30m) won’t get a vasectomy and it’s taring us apart—how do we make this work?,"
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/zIEZynImhs

My original post from a year ago.

I just found this account so if anyone cares, here’s an update. 

We are weeks from our official divorce. It was a deal breaker for and a lack of care for my personal and mental well-being a new a disrespect towards what I’d given up to have our children. I couldn’t get over it. He kept trying to pretend it wasn’t as bad as it was, but inevitably much like you all said, it was his choice. And this was mine.

I am unfortunately considering filing some sort a restraining order however as he had been making accounts to ‘talk sense into me’ through most of my socials.

I actually hadn’t reread my post in a year and got to the end and had a good laugh, I am actually currently dating a lovely woman. It’s only been a few weeks but we knew each other her from college, and just reconnected a month ago.  It’s going very slow, I have twins but she’s been a saint honestly, to come back to my posts topic, It is lifechanging for my stress to know that she cannot get me pregnant, not that we been very intimate yet.

Anyway, not sure anyone cares but there it is. I’m in a much better place than I was, I feel better. My twins are happy. And we’ve been co-parenting decently well other than the social media thing.

Edit: I think I'm going to step away now. 
But my advice. **Don't let your partners use you as a humam shield for all the physical reproccussions of reproduction. Partnership is a give and take of equal sacrifices, and that’s not the case if he is all to comfortable for you to be the only one taking on the physical sacrifice. We do enough bringing children into the world. Your not expecting too much for him to be willing to take the same risks he expects of you.**

I’m happy and healthy, my twins are happy and healthy, 
thanks for all your well wishes. ",1701903125.0,ThrowRAptsdvasectomy,relationship_advice
"I (22M) messed up with my girlfriend (22F) in my sleep, is there a way back for us? ","My girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) have been together for two years and have had a very healthy relationship, with very few arguments. When we do argue, we usually resolve it without any bitterness and take time to hear each other's view. It has always been us against the problem which has worked every time. Last week when we were together in bed we started making out. I guided her hand lower, towards my crotch and she froze up completely. We pulled away and stopped kissing and I could tell very clearly that something was wrong. After asking her a few times she confessed that she didn't want to be intimate with me. I asked why and she said that a week prior to this, when we were both asleep, she woke up to me using her hand to jerk me off. I have no recollection of this whatsoever. She said that I had my eyes closed and was moving in a way that suggested I was also half asleep. Although I don't remember this happening at all and I couldn't believe that I did it, I trust she was telling the truth as she would never lie to me about something as serious as this. I feel very guilty and frankly scared of myself as I was thinking about the worst case scenario of what could've happened. I completely acknowledge that I'm in the wring here and this is my fault, but is there anything I could do to gain her trust back. When we speak about the situation, it is clear we still both want this relationship to work but I can't help but feel she deserves better than to feel like something like this could happen, especially as I don't even remember it happening.",1734011382.0,ThrowRA_Extern92736,relationship_advice
My girlfriend is cheating on me. I need help. 31m/29f,"UPDATE: Yes we have broken up. Yes I’m embarrassed to say I pleaded with her to try again with me while she cried and said she can’t but it’s over now. We have both broken each others trust in different ways in the past and she says she can’t keep trying. She said she’s disgusted with herself and doesn’t know who she is anymore but that it’s too late to try and have a romantic relationship again. She doesn’t even want to see that guy anymore either after all this. She loves me but it’s not right to stay together she says. I am in an impossible situation. I lost my job last year after a bad back injury. My doctor can’t find out what’s wrong but it’s causing me to not be able to do sitting or standing jobs. It’s not getting better but I can’t get disability status and I can’t afford treatments for whatever is wrong anyways. I make no money now and I’m taking our 2 yr old dog which makes it even harder. Renting is as expensive as a mortgage these days and I don’t know where to go. I have no family or friends to fall back on either. I have nowhere to go and not enough money to do so. Just as much as I was scared to loose her, i’m even more scared for my future. 

I’m 31, she’s 29. We’ve been together for 8 years, living together for most of it.

I saw a conversation on her phone last night with a guy she’s been flirting with for weeks. When I read her kissing emoji messages and she said “How’s the man who stole my heart doing?” It absolutely shattered me. She goes to her brothers every weekend for years to play board games and watch movies with a group of people. After reading enough messages I realized that this guy is the one that frequently drives her home afterwards. She said she’s been intimate with him for like a month and a half. She said she hasn’t slept with him but she’s been kissing him and stuff. I’m completely shattered.

We talked for 5 hours, she took a 4 hour nap because I woke her up to talk, and then we talked/hugged for 2 hours before she went back to bed for the night. For the whole 7 hours-ish total of talking, she’s holding my hand and hugging/cuddling me while we talk and cry together. She tells me she loves me but doesn’t know if she can stay with me. I’m basically throwing my heart at her feet telling her more about my feelings for her than I ever have. I’ve made myself incredibly vulnerable and open but it’s now or never to convey the love that I don’t say to her often enough. I’m basically begging her to stay and work things out with me. We have a whole life built together that is worth working on and continuing. Her smile, her voice, she’s everything to me. Picturing her enjoying another persons embrace and lips as she’s holding me and we talk about it is destroying me but I still find myself holding onto every second of her hugs while we talk. I never know at what moment she’ll tell me if she’ll stay with me or not. The suspense is insane and I want every last second of what love is left.. I know I won’t be able to hug her that lovingly if she breaks up with me so i’m taking in as much as I can. Being alone to my thoughts, wide awake now while she’s asleep for the night is turning my brain in circles. I don’t know what to do.. i was literally looking up engagement rings a week ago so this came out of nowhere for me. I’m not perfect but I was under the impression that we had a stronger connection than this after so long.

There are so many paths to deal with this and I just want things to work out. I obviously can’t make her stay and I don’t want her to stay out of pity either but this is not something I want to walk away from and my heart is exploding with a mix of emotions trying to get her to stay while also feeling so incredibly hurt and betrayed by the same person I’m actively hugging and fighting to keep. Every second that I lay here too scared to loose her feels like days. Her nap in-between talks felt like a lifetime. I keep jumping up and pacing. None of this is healthy and I know an outside perspective would probably say to end it and move on for my health but the way I want to move on is together with her. When someone is with you this long and becomes your whole life, you’d do anything to keep them. Leaving her isn’t an option I’ve considered today even once.

Please I need advice on what I can do to show her that our love is worth continuing. Or how I should be handling this in general.

Wife (43F) has decided to be asexual but understands I (40M) am not and is ok with a third person. ,"She does not want me to divorce or break the family apart and is ok with me pursuing a healthy sexual relationship.

I am concerned that any other relationship would be unfair to my wife, unfair to the third or both. I’m also having trouble understanding what sort of third party would even be interested in this sort of relationship. Or how I would manage such relationships.

"My (29F) boyfriend (M32) of 5 months told his parents, that I just met, about my private medical history before I had a chance to meet them and told them I was a cancer survivor. I've never had cancer and my medical history is very personal and he knows it. I feel violated, how do I proceed?","Basically the title here. I have a few chronic conditions and see 9 specialists for them all. I've never had cancer--i had a benign melanoma mole once years ago but nothing that would be classified as cancer. I was in the hospital just before I met my boyfriend for anemia and was never able to find a reason for it, but it's not cancer. 

I've told my boyfriend on at least two occasions that I am guarded about my medical history as people in the past, especially romantic partners, have used it to their advantage to get out of work or get sympathy, and in return never took care of me when I needed it. So I generally don't tell people when I'm sick or in the ER because of it. 

I met his parents for his birthday weekend. It was the first time. The night before I met them, he texts me that he ""told them all about me and they were excited to meet me."" I thought this was really cute at first. 

But I get to his house in the morning and I ask what he said so I don't repeat too much and he said ""well I told them you have xxx condition and you were in the hospital for anemia and that you had leukemia."" 

I was taken aback and said ""I never had leukemia."" He kind of just went ""oh. Guess you'll want to clear that up with them then."" 

So the second thing I said to his parents was clarifying I never had cancer. I was embarrassed by it and he made it seem like no big deal and immediately changed topics. 

I feel really violated that he would disclose such information without my consent and I feel really disappointed and unheard that after 5 months of being very close, he still doesn't know what my conditions are and moreover didn't even bother to check what leukemia is or of I had it. 

I feel a huge loss of trust and affection now. How would you proceed?


EDIT: Big thank you to the few who didn't jump to the ""leave him"" solution. We had a really great talk last night and cleared everything up. He was not at all defensive, he was very apologetic, he asked how he can improve and how he can learn more about my conditions. He admitted to having a few misunderstandings and expressed that he wants to better educate himself. It was not on purpose to hurt me at all. 

To those who called me out on the melanoma thing, as someone started, it was an isolated instance that was quickly taken care of and monitored and cleared. I didn't mean to suggest it was benign. I was trying to convey it was never anything more than mole removal for me. 

To the folks who jump to breaking up while only getting a small snapshot of a one-sided story, you know you can talk about an issue you have and may be able to overcome that issue together as a team and proceed to have a happy and healthy relationship, right? It's totally ok if something is beyond your tolerance, but as someone else said, if you break up every time a problem comes up, you'll never stay with anyone. 

I'm going to proceed with this lovely man and see what happens. Communication is important. You never know what the other person knows or thinks and you should never assume someone will react or act the way you would in a situation. ",1730409517.0,TedGotAJob,relationship_advice
I (31/m) am in a submissive relationship with my girlfriend (28/f) and I just realized she doesn't actually love me,"My girlfriend (of 1 1/2 years) and I follow an ""FLR"" which means female led relationship. It's basically a lifestyle fetish thing. Without being too specific I basically have dedicated my life to making her happy in a seemingly selfless way (it's not really selfless I guess because I enjoy it myself, but that's all I get from it). She controls all the finances, we only do stuff if she wants to do it, we never do what I want, sex is only for her, I do all the chores, etc. The whole relationship is basically about double standards that benefit her and that don't benefit me, to put it simply. But that's just how our relationship is. I've struggled with it at times but I enjoy it overall.

I have a sciatica issue with my back. It's normally not a big deal but over the weekend I seriously screwed it up. It was totally agonizing and I had to go to the hospital. My girlfriend was completely unsupportive and didn't care about me at all. She told me to power through the pain but I was like rolling around in pain almost. It was clearly impossible. I called her by her first name by accident and she yelled at me for being disrespectful. I had to drive myself to the hospital because she wouldn't let me use the phone. She was just completely annoyed about the whole thing. I think she told me that she hopes I catch the virus but I wasn't sure. I was out of it as I was leaving the house. They gave me some muscle relaxers in the hospital and I'm doing better now, but I'm trying not to exert myself too much until the disk completely goes back into place.

Also, while she does sometimes treat me badly as part of the ""role"", she didn't seem to be doing that here. I mean she knew it was serious, and I think she just revealed exactly how she felt. I always thought that even though we had this relationship, that she did actually care about me. But because of the way our relationship was, it didn't come out much. She loved me in her own way, I thought. But these last days, I realized that she actually just views me as a literal servant. She doesn't care about me as a person, only as submissive partner. Even calling it a partnership doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is the wrong place to post this but I wanted to get a vanilla perspective with people that have normal, healthy relationships. Am I overthinking this? Do you think I might be able to make the relationship work long-term? And if you have dabbled in d/s stuff I'd be curious to hear if any of you have had similar experiences.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",1567993503.0,itsathroawai,relationship_advice
My (25M) girlfriend (23F) never wears a bra and it makes me uncomfortable - how do I fix this problem with myself?,"Everytime I have research this problem, the advice I have always seen was to speak with your partner about this and let them know it makes you uncomfortable, and if they’re willing to adjust behavior for you great and if not maybe you aren’t compatible. I disagree with this, because even though this makes me uncomfortable I also believe it’s ridiculous for me to feel this way, and I definitely don’t think I should police how she should dress. 

I want advice on how to fix this problem WITHIN ME. This is a problem within myself, I don’t understand why I feel this way because it’s not like she’s walking around naked. I am extremely happy in this relationship, so I don’t want something dumb like this causing any issues. I want to be a better, more healthy person.

I (M28) Broke Up With My Girlfriend Because She (F28) Wanted Me to Pay for EVERYTHING. I regret my decision. Was I in the wrong?,"I (M28) broke up with my then girlfriend (F28) of 4 years because of money.

Through out my relationship with my ex, I always paid for dates which I am completely okay with. I paid for small trips we'd take across the state and she never had to drive a single time. She lived about 1.75 hours away and had a nicer car than me. I'd always pick her up and drop her off. I did not mind doing those things at all. Matter of fact, I loved it.

Things became tricky when she came to me with expectations about money a year into the relationship. She told me that she expected me to start contributing to her bills, such as her phone bill, her nails, and her hair. She also requested I pay for her special cosmetic skin treatments, shopping, cosmetic products and help her with her car payments.

When we had this conversation the first time it hit me like a truck. I thought I was being financially used and I disputed this for months on end. At some point she told me that the men she had dated in the past did all that plus more. She wasn't lying about it, I saw the receipts. One of them even took her on vacation. I was not jealous about this or feeling insecure about it at the time.

She told me that, that's how relationships are and I shouldn't see it as ""an expense"" rather a token of my love and appreciation towards her especially if I'm working towards getting married. All my friends disagreed with this and told me to dump her, but I didn't. She made me extremely happy in every other aspect of my life. I've been in a few relationships but none like this, no woman had much as much of an effort to make me happy. Let alone a woman this attractive because she defintely turned a lot of heads when we were out together. I was taken care of, and deeply loved, and understood so well and even my bad quirks were accepted and appreciated.

She said she understood I didn't make as much as the last men she dated and she didn't want to compare. She said it was about the gesture and my willingness to do so. So with that, started paying a few of her bills, for her shopping and other things.

Over time, I started getting stressed about money because I didn't have the funds to do things I wanted to in life like improving my standard of living. I couldn't afford investing, or a house or a car newer. I started to also feel insecure because I wasn't earning enough money. Because of this, I started to resent going on dates or other activities because I was struggling financially to keep up. I tried explaining to her that things were tight but she said it was my job to figure things out and that she wouldn't compromise because what I was doing was the bare minimum. She felt disrespected or unloved when I said no to things.

I'm not the type of man to endulge in luxury myelf. I'm super simple, and I felt like I couldn't keep up with her, or what her ex's did for her for her. My insecurities got worse, and at this point my friends and parents were telling me that if I did these things for any other girl, I'd be treated even better and that I was being taken advantage of.

My breaking point was when she asked for a nose job. I told her I couldn't afford it, and she said I could just get it on a payment plan. At that point I told her I had enough and we broke up. We were on and off for a few weeks because we were still close, and the love was mutual, however eventually we drifted away.

Since then I've been alone and reflecting on my decision. My friends and family did not like her at all and said I was being taken advantage of. However, I keep hearing how it's becoming more common for men to offer to pay for a woman's things. Men enjoy taking care of their women, and pampering them and that some of them really go out of their way to make sure that their women are showered with gifts. I hear some men say that it's harder for women to make money (due to wage differences etc.), let alone as much money as men, so we shouldn't expect them to have to pay for things or go 50/50 and make their lives easier because we love them. Especially if we want to get married down the road.

I'm wondering if the issue was actually me. Was it my fault for not making enough money or working harder to make more? Was I not understanding her love language? Was I wrong to complain about money at all, since this is what some modern relationships look like? Is it the expectation that attractive women have high costs/demands?

**TL;DR:** Broke up with my girlfriend because she wanted me to pay for bills, shopping, gifts, travel, etc. Regretting my decision because now I'm more alone than ever and seeing men around me do these things for their women happily. Was I wrong? Is it my fault I don't make enough to date as a man in my late 20s?

Sorry for the excessively long post.

**EDIT:** I did not expect this post to blow up over night. I appreciate everyone's kind words and support. It has given me more confidence in my decision. I have not gotten a chance to read all the comments let alone reply to everyone, but I do get the general consensus that I made the right choice and need to evaluate my values moving into my next relationship whenever that may be.

To answer a few general questions, there weren't any cultural differences, I got my credit card back when we broke up and there have been no charges since then, we spent nearly every second of the day talking even if we weren't together with each other (like at work etc.), and I will consider therapy.

I don't intend to date for a while. I spent a lot on this girl over the past 4 years, and I will need time to recover that amount and work on investing and improving my quality of life. I will also focus on building my career and more healthy relationships with my friends and family.

Again, I can't express enough gratitude to everyone who took the time to comment, provide support, insight and share their experiences.

Thank you.",1718667824.0,ThrowRAAmIBroke,relationship_advice
Do I stay with my boyfriend (58M) after he suddenly is concerned about my(50F) “health”?,"I’m still processing this several days later and trying to decide if, after a pretty great 14 months of dating, I should break up with him.
“Joe” and I met on a dating site. I thought he was a catfish at first because he retired young and is widowed, but no, he’s real, local, and while he’s a little older than I usually date, he’s fun and very attentive, is proactive about planning dates, super thoughtful, and very affectionate. We typically go hiking on the weekend. Being retired, he hikes EVERY DAY and is in great shape. I work a four-10s schedule and do a lot of volunteer work. I don’t exercise regularly and am what my friends have said is “curvy.”

This weekend, during our hike, Joe started getting ahead of me. After a while, I noticed that he had his phone up to his ear. I thought he must have gotten a phone call and didn’t realize he was getting ahead of me. But he just kept going until he got to the top and sat on a bench to wait for me. When I got to the top, I jokingly asked if the slow girl could join him. “I guess that was kind of rude,” he commented. Then said, “Are you ready for a frank discussion?”

He proceeded to tell me that now that my kids (22M, 20M,18M) were all away at college, I needed to spend more time focused on my health. He never said weight, always “health.” 

“When we first started dating, I thought that being in a relationship would motivate you to get healthy…”

“I need my girlfriend— you— to be healthy.”

“You would feel so much better about yourself if you were healthier…”

I asked him if he had intentionally left me behind and he said he was just walking at his normal pace, I was slow. I asked if he had been on a phone call. No, was listening to music because he was bored.

He’s not wrong- I do need/want to lose weight. But I also work a lot, am menopausal, and have a lot of responsibilities. The relationship has been pretty good. I hate to end it over this, but I’m having a hard time getting past the idea that this has clearly been an issue since the beginning (I’m actually a few pounds lighter than when we met) and I’ve been thinking he loves me as I am. 

My ex-husband regularly insulted me about my weight when I was much “healthier” than I am now. I’ve been separated and divorced for 14 years, and this is only the second and longest LTR I’ve been in since my divorce.

Do I walk away and free him up to find someone more to his liking?

UPDATE:
It’s been two weeks since the hike that hurt my heart. While Joe and I talked about what happened later that night, we didn’t speak again (we don’t live together) until 10 days later. We did text and I continued to share how I perceived his comments and that I didn’t think I could move past this. 

When we did have a phone conversation, he apologized and acknowledged being an ass and asked me to forgive him. We had a good conversation about what healthy looks like, our differences in circumstances. I’m giving him another chance. I want to say that I hope I don’t regret it, but I know I won’t regret be gracious. I will also not allow this to become a pattern. 

Thank you everyone who commented and validated my feelings, and also those who did not. I would not have asked the room for advice if I didn’t genuinely want to get other perspectives. Love is much more complicated at this stage of life. As someone who fled an abusive marriage but is also optimistic at sometimes unhealthy levels, I don’t want to have knee jerk reactions to negative situations, but also don’t want to gloss over blatant res flags. I’m definitely taking the optimist route here, so we’ll see how it goes.

My (23M) girlfriend’s (22F) diet is making her crazy. How to do I reason with her?,"ThrowRA - she uses reddit more than me.

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her. 

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube. 

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?

**last edit: I have been trying to reply to almost all the comments as they come in, and I know I didn’t get all of them, but I really do appreciate all of the insight that everyone has offered, except of course for people like my friends who are featured in the first two edits for suggesting that I break up with my girlfriend… But that’s beside the point. I think I have a good idea of the next steps that I should take as a supportive boyfriend to encourage her to get the help that she needs, and I’m hoping to be able to update you all on this soon. The only thing I haven’t enjoyed about this experience is the fact that this account that I just made this morning now has three times as much karma as my main. Thanks again**

[Update] I (27M) just found out my girlfriend (24F) is lying about being on a trip. How do I confront her?,"NEW EDIT#2 DATED 10/23/24 BELOW

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/b7br03HAIJ

Hey everyone, I had some DMs asking for an update so here it is. 

To quickly summarize my last post: A few weeks back my girlfriend was supposed to go on a trip a few states away to go to a conference. I came to find out that the conference was cancelled and she didn’t actually go, and never even bothered to tell me. She lied by omission about it by not telling me when I texted her to have a good flight. I found out she didn’t go because her best friend posted a picture of them at a show in our local nearby city.

So here we are, almost a month later. I was wreck and spiraling these past few weeks, and after being together for almost two years I was too panicked to reach out and ask to see her. During the three weeks since her planned trip, she hasn’t reached out once to me. 

That was until yesterday, when she casually reached out like we hadn’t just ignored each other for 3 weeks and asked to see a movie. So I just finally saw her tonight. In the car I asked about her trip. Her facial response was really weird like she got caught off guard. I’m guessing she was expecting me to forget about it after a few weeks of not seeing her. She just said “it was ok” which instantly confirmed my suspicions. I asked her what she had done and she said she went to that conference one day (which as I said in my last post was cancelled), and went to a show after before returning home the day after I made my original post. I asked her which and she claimed the show that was in our local city.

I was driving at the time and it was dark out, so I waited to confront her as I didn’t want to get emotional and endanger us. I confronted her for lying about the trip, doubling down and lying about the conference, and tripling down to lie about the show. Her immediate response was to start deflecting, saying that if this is making me upset to imagine how she felt that her conference and trip was cancelled. She said how she was so heartbroken and upset that the conference was cancelled (which was cancelled 5 weeks ago) that she didn’t want to talk about it. She kept saying that she doesn’t owe it to me or anybody else to tell us about her business and what’s going on in her life. I of course called her out for gaslighting me, to which her response was that she was not gaslighting me. Kind of ironic I guess. When I talked about how it made me feel and that she damaged my trust for her, she again tried to belittle my feelings by rolling her eyes and saying that it was only a show.

This conversation ended up opening to a much bigger issue in our relationship that I didn’t mention in my last post. Generally, Amy treated me really poorly throughout the  relationship. She was hot and cold, put zero effort into communication, and it never felt like she made a priority. She’d give me zero affection or compliments despite drooling and crushing over male celebrities all day. She’s made little effort to connect me and her family and friends. We’ve talked about all of this a few times now, she would always say she was overwhelmed with some new excuse and promise it would get better. I would cave in and agree to work through things. As expected, things never got better. This time was the same, where she blamed a new job for being overwhelmed and that’s why she’s been so distant.  

But this time was different. I guess her blatant lie to my face and your guys comments in the back of my mind gave me power to put my foot down. I broke up with her then and there. She kept begging me for one more chance, to think on it for a few days, that she cares about me and didn’t intend to hurt me, all that nonsense. But the whole time I was the one bawling, and there wasn’t a tear on her face. 

It really broke my heart ending things but I’ve also really grown to hate myself for putting up with her treatment for so long. I’m hurting a lot right now, and I’m scared to get back into the dating world after two years of aging and some weight gain. I really loved her with every bit of my heart and I’m terrified to picture my life without her. I really want to call her up and give her one final chance to get things right but I know I’d never forgive myself if she didn’t change and broke my heart again. Im hurting bad and I could really use some words of encouragement right now.

Thank you all. 

EDIT: I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone for the overwhelming positivity. I didn’t expect this post to blow up did but I’m glad it did. It really helped solidify me knowing that I made the right choice, even if it’s hurting right now. I miss my ex a lot but I’m a little more confident that things will work out in the long run now. It’s gonna be a scary road but I’m glad it’s finally started. Thank you all again

EDIT 2, 1 week later: Hi all. Just going to make a update cause I’ve seen this post reach a few subreddits and tiktok accounts (including my favorite tiktok Reddit stories account lol). I’ve replied to a decent bit of comments providing some more context and clarifications such as timelines of things, why I stayed for so long, why I accepted her neurodivergence as an excuse, etc. I’m sorry I can’t get to all of the comments, there’s so many. I’ve just come for a few brief updates and clarifications. I’ll try to keep it short but I do tend to ramble a little. 

Like you all suggested, I’ve removed Amy on social media. I did it really late one night when I couldn’t sleep, a few hours after she normally sleeps. I woke up about 5 hours later for work, around the time when she wakes up, and decided I should block her so I don’t get ever tempted to look at her profiles or give her a chance to contact me. She already beat me to the punch and blocked me first thing in the morning. I’m not sure how to block her when I’m blocked, but I guess this gets the job done. 

I wanted to address one comment — a lot of people are asking why I originally said our relationship was pretty good and waited to drop the bombshell of everything until my update. Honestly, I just wanted unbiased opinions on the original situation, like if there was any reason why somebody in a healthy relationship would have not told me about the trip cancellation. I was naive and was hoping that there’d be some reasoning that I wasn’t seeing, and that we could work through this issue. I knew that Amy had been treating me poorly outside of this issue, but it felt like her treatment of me was kind of on the upswing and that we were growing closer, until she stonewalled me for 3 weeks after my first post. Before my first post, I felt like one final talk with her would really keep us on the right path and hopefully fix things for good. Obviously I was naive and stupid for thinking that, and let my love for her blind me to the obvious, but hindsight is 20/20. It’s hard to recognize that emotionally abusive relationships arent going to change when you’re in them. Reflecting back there were always times when she’s briefly treat me well to pull me back in. I’d guess that’s what was going on recently but who knows. 

And to the people suggesting that we weren’t actually in a relationship, that we had different agreements of what the relationship meant, and that I belong in a psych ward, thanks. Appreciate that. But no. When we were still “seeing each other” (as in, after a few dates) I specifically asked her to be exclusive and she said yes. Once I felt ready, I sat her down, told her how much I cared about her, and asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed and we’ve been bf/gf ever since. We’ve posted each other on Valentine’s Day, and both had pictures of each other on social media. When talking to others, she introduced me to them as her boyfriend. We’ve been on weekend trips away together with my friends. Early on, we had conversations about what we want in terms of kids, marriage, where to live, etc to make sure we were on the same page. While I might’ve been naive and had heavy rose-tinted glasses, I’m not some psycho stalker. She knew we were in a relationship, treated me like crap, acknowledged that my feelings were valid all of the times that I brought up her treatment of me, and when I broke up with her she begged me to take a few days and reconsider. This wasn’t some fantasy you’d see in a creepy movie.

To end off my update, im doing okay. I was really sad the first two days, but that’s passed. I am still in pain, grieving, and thinking about her, but there is some relief from all the comments reinforcing that I made the right choice. Things are hard right now but I know I’ve made the best choice in for me and my well-being. Thanks all again, and hopefully this is the end of my time here.

My bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status.,"Editing for TW: rape, abuse

Edit: the mom was told that I’m undetectable and what that means, but she’s too overwhelmed with fear to really listen and comprehend. 

For the last two months, my(28f) boyfriend (28m) have been staying with his mom during quarantine. I have my own home with roommates and so does he but she insisted we stay with her temporarily to more easily adhere to social distancing.

I am HIV positive, and my boyfriend is aware. My boyfriend is HIV negative. I’m undetectable, which means there is so little amount of virus in my body that I cannot transmit the virus to anyone else. I cannot infect another person, even through unprotected sex. If you aren’t aware of how this happens, people with HIV can take antiretrovirals to basically fight the virus and protect your white blood cells from being attacked so the virus is unable to replicate. A lot has changed over the decades.

A little background: I have been HIV positive since I was 15 years old. I have a lot of trauma associated with my status. The person who gave it to me was an adult who was extremely abusive. This person beat and raped me regularly and held my HIV status over my head as a way to control me and keep me in the relationship. For years, I felt unlovable and dirty. It took A LOT of work and therapy to overcome my own personal shame towards my status. I don’t tell anybody about my status unless they have to know – like they’re medical professionals or if I’m sleeping with someone. My family knows, but none of my friends do. Not even my closest ones. I was so afraid of the stigma of my status that it changed the trajectory of my entire life. I was suicidal for years and stayed in lots of bad relationships because I was worried nobody better would love me. I’m doing better now. I’m in a healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. I’m back in school, working on my career. I’m stable and independent. I’m turning my life around I’m doing a good job at it.

Well, my boyfriend’s mom found my medication. I had a pill bottle in my purse in the closet. She claims she found a pill on the floor and saw a bag sticking out of my purse and thought she would put it there. The medication was in the bag and that’s how she found it.

If I’m honest, I don’t buy her story. My medication is extremely expensive and I’ve always had dogs so I’ve always paid close attention to making sure I don’t drop any pills or leave them around. After a decade of taking medication every day, I know to pay close attention to how I get the pills out of my bottle. I never just pour them out into my hand. Even if I did actually drop a pill, I would think the normal reaction would be to set it aside on a counter or bring it directly to one of us, not go into my purse. Either way, she went through my purse and it feels like a huge invasion of privacy. I’m not sure what she was even doing in the closet to begin with. I really think she was just snooping.

Anyways, instead of coming to me or my boyfriend, she told his sister. And then his sister told her husband and their other sister. Now the whole family knows my HIV status. The mom apparently reacted with things like, “How could she do this to herself?” and “Was she not raised properly?” She’s always been judgmental towards me, but this is victim blaming at its finest. She was worried that I gave it to her son but he took a test in front of them and he is negative. His sisters are apparently not judging me for it, but his mom definitely thinks lesser of me. 

I’m so angry that I’m being judged for something that I didn’t do to myself, especially since I’ve handled it responsibly. I’m angry that she went through my stuff. I’m angry that they spread my private medical information through the whole family. There is so much trauma associated with my status and I feel like I like the control of this information has been taken from me.

His mom is divorced and I understand that she was scared for her son and didn’t have someone to talk to about it and that’s why she spoke with the sister, but she should have gone to my boyfriend directly. His mom was a nurse so she should know better than to spread people’s private medical information around. His sister also had no reason to tell the other sister. This my private medical information. My medical history and our sex life is none of their business.

As soon as I learned what she did, I packed my things and left without saying a word to her. I love my boyfriend and according to him, he stood up for me when talking to his mom and sister, but I don’t know what to do from here. His family is EXTREMELY close. They all talk every day and spend a lot of time together.  I don’t want to see them, but I’m going to have to at some point. And I don’t want to feel like I’m the “girlfriend with HIV” forever. 

I feel sick to my stomach and I’ve been crying every day. What do I do? What should I expect from my bf?


Side note: I have a virtual therapy appointment next week, so if you’re going to suggest therapy, I’m way ahead of you.

My [F33] adult stepson [M26] seems to be becoming a NEET. I love my husband [M46] but am considering leaving.  How do we fix this?,"In 2020 my husband (m46) and I (f33) purchased a larger home and have been married for 5 years.  I wanted to live somewhere quiet in the suburbs and try for children.  Almost immediately upon learning of this, his adult son (m26) requested to move back in.  His son had always lived with his mom so we hadn't spent much time together, but he wanted to move to our city to go to school and take advantage of his free GI Bill college benefits from his father.  We greatly wanted him to find success, and this was an adult family member, so no rent or responsibilities were outlined.

Within a year, though, he had failed the entrance exams and decided not to go back to school.  He spent most of his time visiting his ""family"" (he is very close with his mother's family and there is clear animosity that his dad was away in the military for much of his childhood so he never calls his dad ""family"" - it was the ex-wife who cheated, got pregnant, had the kid under my husband's military insurance, and then divorced and married her affair partner, just in case anyone asks). So shortly after a year of him essentially doing nothing other than playing video games and smoking weed, he moved back to his mom's.

Well about one year later, he requests to move back.  This time it will be different because his mom has helped him to get a WFH position at her company.  So he has a plan and just wants to bond with his dad, save up money, and move out. Okay, sounds good.  At some point we learn that he's deeply in debt.  I had always seen boxes in the mail, he bought a brand new car, and he bragged about his luxury purchases, so I had a hunch but stayed out of it.  The plan became: help him get out of debt and learn about finances.  His dad taught him about interest rates and helped to transfer his balance to a low interest loan.  We chatted about paying it off, but decided to hold off as we hadn't seen any real responsibility.

Unfortunately a few months later, he was let go.  But his spending didn't seem to stop. I continued to get alerts from Ring throughout the middle of the night as he went partying, he continued to have money to spend on weed, played video games all day.  As someone who moved out at 18, worked to get a full ride scholarship, and now works each day to pay for this house -- it definitely felt insulting.  We ended up going to marriage counselling where the therapist was so ridiculous (I think the guy was honestly 100 years old, rambling, drinking ensure to stay alive) that I just let it go for awhile longer.  Before this, I had been cooking meals for everyone, but I basically stopped at this point.

This went on for maybe 6 months, with his dad asking what his plans were, if he'd go to school, join the military, learn a trade, anything.  He didn't want to do anything. He didn't have a passion in life.  So his dad helps him to get a military contracting job.  Secret clearance paid for.  It's a bottom of the ladder job but it's a great stepping stone! He quits on day 2.  He doesn't tell us, he just stops going and I ask after him being home for 1-2 weeks what happened.  His dad confronts him and finds that he didn't like having nothing to do.  Staring at the clock all day.  His dad is disappointed and basically disengages at this point.  He says he isn't helping him anymore (not charging rent, not kicking him out, just not helping him with the career search).

Miraculously, several months later, he lands a well paying job at a medical clinic.  This is great! But after a couple of days his car is still in the drive way.  Why isn't he at work? He stops leaving his room until we've gone to bed, so my husband puts off talking to him.  We find out maybe 2 months later that he quit because he wanted to go to Europe with his family.  Family means everything to this kid.  He couldn't give up the opportunity to go on this family vacation that his MD grandma was paying for, even for a high paying job that didn't require a college degree!

My husband says he needs to find a job or he's out of the house.  It's a weak threat, because at this point he's declined help from everyone.  His uncle basically hands him a marketing position -- he says the can't do it because he wants to go out for his birthday weekend.  His other uncle gets him interviews for Costco, he doesn't go.  My husband had recruiters call him, he hung up once he figured it out.  At this point I'm talking to my husband about wanting to move out, myself.  I work hard at a high stress job and it's honestly too much to have someone I consider to be a NEET living in the home that I pay for.  He doesn't come out until night time, doesn't interact with us, basically acts like he doesn't exist.  I only see Ring alerts all night (my only rule is no smoking weed in the house, so I guess to go smoke).  I feel it isn't healthy for him either.  I've even run this situation by my husband's mother (she's Asian, I'm not, so this is all especially difficult as culturally family should support each other) and she said kick him out.

I feel guilty at the same time, though.  What if he's depressed? What if he's really trying? Would charging rent that we put into an account help? But you need a job to pay rent.  I don't want to ruin my husband's relationship with his son, which is why I'm feeling like I need to be the one to leave.  But my husband believes his son needs a wake up call and that he will ultimately thank him for doing this.  So I'm asking at this point, what should we do?

TLDR: Adult stepson doesn't want to work or go to school, just wants to play video games and smoke weed.  I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the situation and environment in my home and feel like one of us needs to leave.  But would love to have a solution where everyone ends up happy.

Edit - I want to sincerely thank everyone for providing advice and perspective.  You've made me feel I'm not a terrible person for wanting this and that it really is the best course of action.  My husband is fed up with the situation and is ready to provide him with the eviction notice tonight.  I hope someday in the near future he will find his path and hopefully this will be a positive step towards that.  ",1727368153.0,NeedGuidance12345,relationship_advice
"My(43m) GF(36f) asked to open the relationship, and i just pointed her to the door.","So, like the title says, My(43m) GF(36f) asked that we open the relationship, and i just pointed her to the door. it was too much?I strongly believe that in a monogamus relationship when someone ask to open it, well is because that person saw something else out there and is ready to try it instead of working in the relationship. Basically is blindsiding his/her partner.

So i have being with Fran (36) over the last two years and a half, almost two as a couple. I tought that things where moving smothly and was about to ask her to move in (At the begining of April), But lately she was acting rather distant. So i dicided to wait a little and watch. (i was cheated on the past, so i'm a little cautios with some signs)Out of nowhere this last friday she asked me to open the relationship, she gave me all her big speech, and when she ended her ""presentation"" i asked her if she has someone in mind, because is not like we decided to day and basically going out with other persons tomorrow, basically i trick her into tell me what i alredy knew, and yes she has someone in mind, wich means to me, that either she already did it or she has all set up.

So i got up, walk around the apartment while she was trying to sell that this could be good for both us and our relationship, by the time she ended talking i hand her one of my sportbags with all  her stuff in it, and tell her to left the spare key over the table on her way out, that we are done and she knows why.

Then i went to the couch and turn on the TV, just trying to look indiferent and save face, she was speecheless for a while, about to cry, but before she couldn't say something, i tell her that i didn't wanna talk about anything and she should leave.

As soon as she left, i felt like crap, so unworthy, cryied a little and as right now i'm still mourning.

My phone has going almost nuclear with al the calls and text i recibed from friends of both sides about my extreme reaction over her “simple” request. Don't know what she told them.

So now i'm sitting wondering if i really went overboard and at the same time fighting the urge to run back to her, because deep inside even knowing my feelings for her are still there, the trust is gone and i'm not gonna spend all my time watching her movements, is not healthy, may be in time, really don´t know.

Before anyone pointed out, yes i know, my reaction is pure reflection of me, not what she did or was about to do, or could do.

so, did i went overboard?

UPDATE my bf says I need to lose weight even though im only 100lbs,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hsv605/my_bf_says_i_need_to_lose_weight_even_though_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

For some reason I can’t access my original throwaway account but I decided that I should still update you guys.

I ended up leaving my bf because if I got to 70-80lbs I would likely die since I’m already starting to feel really bad from my weight. I’m going to quit my daily jogs for awhile and only do it once a week. I have also decided to give up starving myself and eat more then salads so I can gain weight again hopefully I can get back to 130lbs as that’s when I felt healthy.

Thanks for all of the kind comments on my last post as it really helped make this decision.

Edit:even at 130lbs I wasn’t over weight according to my doctor",1595179513.0,throwRA100lbs,relationship_advice
My (21M) Dad (54M) constantly makes jokes about my rape,"To keep my background short, I was in a relationship many years ago for two years. It was toxic, it was ""Fuck me or I'll cheat on you"" it was ""You aren't a real man if you don't do things with me. This was in the 8th-10th grade. Horrible awful shit. I have forgiven her since, I talked to her years later about it. She was being raped by her stepdad during our relationship and that violence and awful shit basically got transfered onto her and then onto me.

I finally had the guts to tell my parents about what happened to me about a year ago and to explain how that went I'll give a quote from my dad ""I don't understand how you didn't like it"". He doesn't believe a man can be raped unless by another man. But that shit really fucked me up for a long time, even to this day it still fucks me up. I can't get hard sometimes because I get such anxiety about it. One time I talked to my parents about it when I was like 20 and to this day if I ever go out with a girl, my dad will say ""Could you get it up this time?"" And laugh away. Just to give an example. I just don't know what to do, I feel like shit about it way to often to be healthy.",1600478588.0,ThrowRA-472,relationship_advice
My husband eats so. much. food. (over 10k calories a day) and has gotten SO obese and I just don't fucking know what to do anymore.,"He didn't use to be like this. We got married when we were both 25, now we're 33 and he's gone from around 180 to over 450 pounds.

Looking at him fills me with horror and despair. He may as well have been diagnosed with terminal cancer because his size is going to have the same result sometime in the next 10 years if he doesn't stop. In my heart I no longer believe my husband will be here by the time I'm 50.

His medical problems so far:

- A mini stroke from a blood clot

- Abnormal heart palpitations

- ER visits both of those times

- Extremely high blood pressure

- Extremely high cholesterol

- Diabetes (didn't check his levels or take insulin as directed until I began reminding him)

- Inability to walk much (uses a scooter sometimes)

- Joint pain

- Lymphedema in one of his legs

- Sleep apnea and has to wear a cpap machine at night so he won't literally die from not breathing

- Five different medications that I manage the scheduling of or he wouldn't remember/not care/I don't know.

His diet:

- Fast food. Goes through drive thru's on his way to work, way home, and/or picks up takeout. Mcdonald's, Burger King, local Chinese joints, taco bell, KFC, popeyes, Domino's, Dunkin donuts, Chick Fil A, pizza hut, Arbys......... 

- Also gets all this delivered from uber eats whenever he feels like it, which is at least once a day. He even does it in the middle of the night.

- Everything else is just junk food like chips and other packaged snacks. All sorts of candy. Ice cream. Baked desserts. Frozen/microwave food like breakfast trays and sausages, burrito's, easy mac, basically anything you could find at a gas station convenience store. 

- All his meals are full of sugar, frying oil, butter, fat and grease, just the worst ingredients that are exactly what he needs to stop eating.

We're both WFH right now. I've watched him for a few days this week keeping a record of everything he ate (that I saw--if he ate at night or when I was in another room, I missed those) and then looked up the approximate caloric value of every item. Every single day was AT LEAST 10,000 calories. The worst day was a little over 14,000. A sedentary male of his age and height needs around 2500/day, just for comparison.
 
So this has been an ongoing problem for years and just keeps getting worse. Both his diet and the medical consequences.

I. Am. Terrified... that I'm going to be burying him, possibly before we even reach our 50's and get to enjoy old age together. I'm terrified I'm going to have to see the person I love most in the entire world die from a long, drawn out, painful accumulation of treatable illnesses. And some days I wonder if I'm not already watching that, in slow motion.

I have asked him so many times to please, please eat healthier. He will...he eats the healthy meals I make, but then he STILL eats junk food after. Or orders a second fast food dinner. He doesn't get it's not enough to combat the damage to his body.

I've also begged him to go to the doctor. He only goes when something is catastrophically wrong (see the emergencies in my list above). In fact most of the more ""minor"" problems in that list were only diagnosed because he happened to be at the ER for something major and they found it. 

I've begged him to see a doctor for a routine, non-emergency, check up specifically with the aim of building a support plan for weight loss and healthier diet. He says he'll do it then has excuses why he didn't. I myself have gone ahead and made a couple appointments for him to make sure calling people wasn't stressing him out, and then when the time came he just never went. Same thing with a therapy appointment. I set it up for him and he never went. I wondered and still do if there's something like depression at play, and this is the form it takes? But I'll never know if he won't talk about it to anyone. He doesn't even talk to ME about what's causing it. Beyond saying he just likes food and eating makes him happy.

I'm reaching a point where I feel like my heart is breaking. Like he's leaving me, even though our relationship is as strong as ever. I don't understand it. Why doesn't he care.

What else can I do to get him to take care of himself? Does he not understand that every day he doesn't change is one day closer to him dying young?

I live with this fear every single day and I just can't do it anymore, I need to find SOMETHING that will make him stop. I'm desperate. I cannot just fucking give up. Please give me any suggestions you can think of, I'll try anything.

TL;DR: My husband has been overeating for years, gained hundreds of pounds, nothing I say or try to do for him has made a difference. He's going to die. I know it. I need to convince him to just take that single first step towards getting better.",1590800709.0,ThrowRAhusbandhealth,relationship_advice
Update: My (34m) wife (33f) cheated and is now pregnant.,"So the DNA reports came back. And the baby is mine. 

I wasn't even surprised at this point. 

The day we sat down and talked, she told me she had returned home to immediately take her birth control pill. So she was certain the baby would be mine and she once again said if by any chance it was the other guy's she would abort the baby. That she had no plans or desire to have kids with anyone except me. 

I won't lie, her words were a good comfort to me. I could tell she was telling the truth. I've been reading too many reddit stories of men finding out their wives were all too willing to have some random man's child. I cannot lie, even the idea of that made me sick. 

I asked her if she'd keep this baby even if I filed for divorce. She said yes. So, that's where we're at in terms of the baby. 


As for the other guy, not disclosing too many details, it was a relative of hers. An older cousin who had been harassing her for a long time (literally since before we even met). She just never said anything to me or complained because her family (and frankly mine too) are obsessed with the entire ""family comes before all"" mindset. I'm seeing this pressure to keep everything together happen to me in real time after all. 

Anyway, long story short, he had returned to our hometown around 3 months ago and started texting, followed and harassing her. Hence why all the blocked numbers and repeated texts of being happy with me and loving only me. 

She admitted to sending him a videotape of us being intimate as a way to make him ashamed of her and leave her alone. That she had repeatedly spoken about me and mocked him when he insisted he could do better. 

She thinks all this goading and insulting had triggered him to attack her and she never said anything to me because she is certain it was her fault for ""engaging"" with him. That if she had ignored him like before, he'd have just left her alone. 

I've seen enough texts, confronted enough people and heard enough to confirm she isn't lying. 

Now I'm just focused on getting this woman the therapy it turns out she has needed for a long time. 

I have decided on legal separation for now but haven't met with the lawyer yet. 

Our kids will have both of us of course and I'm happy to know at least my irrational hate for the baby is gone. It's the only positive thing I'm feeling right now. 

I'm beginning to think clearer now. Reddit has helped me feel confident in protecting myself. I don't feel quite so selfish now. I will support Anna because she desperately needs it. Our relationship needs work but that comes second to her health, our baby and our sons. I'm going to work on us but I'm also taking steps to protect myself and the boys. 

I have reddit to thank for giving me the confidence to do this and not feel guilty. Much thanks for that.

Edit: I am not divorcing her. It's a temorary separation because she needs to heal first before we can be a couple again. 

Her response to being harassed by that man was putting herself on me. She admitted our first time (over 10 years ago) was in part influenced by his obsession with her virginity. Meaning our first time happened before she was actually ready for something like that. 

Her response to his texts was sending intimate videos of us. 

Her response to me trying to get some space was trying to seduce me back into bed with her. 

I'm not a therapist. But that attitude is not healthy. That much even I can tell. Right now her idea of therapy is to pretend like nothing happened and try to get intimate with me at any opportunity. And she takes me saying no as rejecting her for being used. 

I'm not helping her with this separation I know, but I can tell I'm not helping her cope by being too close either. A little separation is best as suggested by the Therapist and Lawyer. 

Yes, I know she didn't cheat. It's that the title has to be same for an update. I'm not calling her assault cheating.",1705000510.0,ThrowRA_98232,relationship_advice
My (29F) Husband (30M) is no longer attracted to me so I don’t want him in the delivery room anymore,"Throwaway account because my friends and family know my main.

My husband Andrew and I are expecting our first child in just a few weeks. It was an unexpected pregnancy but we’re both excited and welcome this new chapter in our lives. We’ve discussed it prior that he would be present in the room with me as my support person. Some context - He has always been very sweet and caring. It took a little bit of communication and adapting to each others needs, but he’s now very very supportive and always makes sure my needs are met. I was more than happy with him being in the delivery room with me during what I’d consider one of the scariest times of my life and wanted him to experience seeing his daughter take her first breath. This was before our conversation last night. 

My husband and I have been on a bit of a decline in terms of our sex life. It used to be good when we first started dating, and I thought we were sexually compatible, however, within the last year, it has done a 180. At first, he blamed it on stress, then finances, then his health, and I believed it all of it. I recommended things we could do to improve that or ways I could help lighten his load, but he assured me, he’d work on it himself. It never got better - in fact, it kept declining. We had another talk last night about this as I told him I was starting to feel like we were friends more than lovers and that’s when he confessed - he was no longer attracted to me. It had to do partly with me gaining a bit of weight during the pregnancy, but mostly due to my lifestyle changes. 

When we first started dating, I had a lot more free time to take care of my body and weight. I was 5 4”and 115lbs. Curvy in all the right places and would get constant attention from men when I was single. We moved in shortly after dating, and I guess my priorities had changed, because now I had to work full-time 9-5, sometimes weekends, picked up a side gig and also did 90% of the cooking and cleaning at home. I had no time to prioritize the gym or working out and gained 10lbs since moving in and 30lbs since becoming pregnant (which I expect to lose most of after giving birth). Through all the tears last night during our conversation, I told him I would work on prioritizing my health and the gym again, and would make time to take care of my appearance so he was happy.  However, when I mentioned that I didn’t want his view of me to change even more, so I think it’s best if he wasn’t in the room with me as I gave birth, he was extremely upset and disappointed. I told him giving birth wasn’t a spectator sport and I wanted him there initially because I felt supported by him and comfortable with him seeing me at my most vulnerable - crying, screaming, projectile shitting lol. Now that I know he’s no longer attracted to me, I’m willing to work on that, but I don’t think him seeing me in that way would help our sexual relationship at all.

Should I suck it up and let him in the delivery room even though I think it would affect how he views me?

EDIT TO ADD: For those wondering why I work so much if my husband earns as much as he does.. My workload is just very heavy that sometimes I will need to work on the weekends to meet deadlines. I’m not choosing to work extra shifts to make ends meet. My side gig is a personal project of mine that, although doesn’t bring in much, is full filing to me and I would like to one day grow it into a full time opportunity. For now though, I have to put in a few hours here and there, but it does add up. 

EDIT TO ADD AGAIN: I want to clarify that the main issue isn’t just the numbers on the scale, but the lifestyle change. When we met, I was very active (going to the gym, sports, eating very healthy etc) and that was a turn on for him. The issue is now that I don’t have much time for those things, he doesn’t find me attractive anymore because I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle. I don’t have the energy or time to put towards prioritizing my health and wellness like I used to which led to the weight gain and it was a bit of a wake up call for me. I’m making these changes for me and the baby as well, not just for my husbands, but seeing all these comments regarding the household divide has me second guessing what fair contributions to our household looks like. I’ll be sitting down and speaking with him about redividing our tasks so it’s fair to the both of us and we each have time to spend on ourselves. :) Him being in the delivery room will be dependent on how that conversation goes as well but I’ll be prioritizing my comfort above all during the birth!!

Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?**

**Edit:**  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party,"I deleted my earlier post because I was so messed up about it at the time I realized it wasn't healthy to have a conversation about it yet.  I made that post right after the guy called me in an attempt to cope but it didn't work. My thoughts were getting too dark and I needed to completely separate myself from the situation for safety. After holing myself up at my parents place and surrounding myself with people I could trust, my head is back on straight and I'll fill in those who asked for an update.

A quick recap for those who didn't see my original post. I will refer to my fiance as Jane. One of the bridesmaids husbands contacted me and told me he had seen something that made him suspect Jane had been sexual with a stripper at her bachelorette party. ANY sex or romantic kissing outside that relationship was a complete deal breaker that was established when the relationship had begun. When I asked him for details, he indicated a handjob in a roundabout way. When I asked if he could be mistaken or misinterpreting a text or overheard conversation, he kept insisting he was 100% sure. I personally know the bridesmaid, I think she was feeling guilty and she was using her husband as some sort of a proxy informant to keep my girlfriend from coming after her when I confronted her.

When I got off the phone with the guy, I was so destroyed about it I just shut down. I had just had my own sort of non-bachelor-party party at home playing WOW Classic with some friends. So to hear this news after such a wonderful day hit extra hard. My cousin who has been friends with Jane since childhood went to the party with her, so I decided to try to calm down and wait until the next day to ask her if she saw anything. At this point I was still hoping this was some sort of misunderstanding or mean prank. Jane didn't live with me, and she was planning on staying the night at her parents home so I knew she wouldn't show up unannounced. I basically laid in bed all night staring at the dark ceiling, listening to The Doors and Opeth, trying not to lose my mind.

I waited until noon the next day to call my cousin. I wasn't able to get through the first 5 times I called, red alarms going off like crazy now. So when I suspected she was avoiding me, I went over to my parents place and used my dads office line. When she finally answered the phone and realized it was me, the somber tone in the voice of a normally annoyingly upbeat 23 year old party girl, pretty much told me everything I needed.

Me: I heard things got a little crazier than usual last night.

Her: Yeah...

Me: I think you already know why I'm calling don't you?

Her: Yes... (obviously holding back tears at this point)

Basically long and weeping cousin story short; I found out Jane did indeed give a stripper a hand job, along with several other women, some of whom are in LTR's or married. That they then decided to leave the house they were at and drive intoxicated to the strip club afterwards where Jane and a few other women had ""private"" dances. My cousin tried to argue that this doesn't mean Jane doesn't love me, and it was just meaningless fun that got out of hand. This fucking infuriated me, I didn't shout at her, but I told her if that's what she thinks, she has no idea what love actually is. At this point I informed my parents and brothers what was going on, and of course my mother starts crying. Another person hurt by this stupid bullshit.

I spent the rest of the day laying in bed at my parents house staring at the ceiling ignoring Janes calls and texts. I know some people have more open relationships and can get past this stuff, but I'm just not that guy. I'm monogamous all the way to the center. I eventually cancelled everything and lost a bunch of deposits. I know it's a bitch move but I broke up with Jane over text. I decided it was best to just walk away clean with no serious confrontation. There was nothing to gain by shouting, arguing, making accusations and calling her names. When people are cornered like this when they do something wrong they can lash out and I didn't want to have the woman I was about to marry say horrible shit to me in some sort of defense of her behavior. I am fucking heartbroken and feel betrayed and that kind of shit isn't going to help. I just sent her a text explaining I know what she did. I explained I don't want revenge, I'm not interested in humiliating her or her friends and spreading it around, but it is a sure sign that we aren't right for each other and it is over with no possibility of reconciliation. I waited until she responded once to make sure she got the text and have blocked her on my phone and all social media. I gave the crap she had at my place to my cousin to give back to her and I haven't heard anything from her or her family since.

I still feel like hammered dog shit, but I am doing better as far as not feeling like a blackhole is sucking me inside out. But this wasn't like the breakups I had in highschool and college. Something broke inside me this time that can't be repaired like before. My confidence is completely destroyed in my body now. I keep thinking what it was about the stripper guy that is so incredible that he could make seemingly faithful woman cheat and potentially throwaway everything. Was it bigger muscles, bigger dick, better looks, better personality? I'm not a super model, but I'm decent. I don't act like a bitch or a pussy. Or am I just stupid? I was 100% sure of this girl, yet I got cheated on right before our wedding. This kind of crap really take a mans soul grinds it up, eats it and shits it back out.

\*\*\*Update: Someone from her camp finally contacted me. Her stepdad called me tonight to ask what was going on and if there's anyway to fix things. I didn't give him any details, I just explained that Jane stepped outside the bounds of forgivable behavior in our relationship, and there's absolutely no way to salvage things, and any time spent trying by any party is time wasted that would be better spent moving on. When I said that I could tell he understood what it meant and basically what happened. He's a pretty laid back old-school Hispanic dude, said he's sorry things didn't work out, and wished me well. Wasn't super close with the guy, but I will miss hanging out in his garage shooting the shit about motorcycles and stuff.

\*\*\*2nd Update: I just got done talking to the bridesmaids husband again who first called me and let me know what was going on. I don't know him, but I am a friendly acquaintance with his wife. Apparently what happened is his wife became extremely uncomfortable when the some of the women started grabbing and stroking the strippers dick, and she left and went home. When he asked her why she came home early she got upset and spilled the beans. More than likely to protect her own marriage if it got out, I would guess. Anyway, dude made a moral call and decided the husbands and boyfriends of the women had a right to know how their significant others were acting when they weren't around, and he made his wife give him all the contact info she had. Seriously, I owe this guy so much. Had I found out about this a few years down the line, the end of the relationship would have been so much worse. His wife still won't talk to me, but It doesn't matter now. I told the dude when things settle down I'm going to take him out and buy him every beer in the bar. Had this dude not had the moral fortitude to make the call, I may have never known.

\*\*\*FINAL UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e6fs4c/final\_update\_i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e6fs4c/final_update_i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f/)",1574982392.0,ThrowRAguy1993,relationship_advice
I (58M) feel like I never really knew my wife (57f) after seeing the way she handled finding out about our daughters (25f) actions,"I am aware the title is confusing and unclear, but the situation is complicated. I am overwhelmed and confused and I feel like everything I knew about the people closest to me was a lie. 

Long story short, my daughter Anna (25F) cheated on her boyfriend Adam (27M) who I have an amazing relationship with and is now pregnant. The child is not his. The other man doesn't know yet. Adam was on a business trip that lasted about 3 weeks. After he came back I assume Anna told him about the pregnancy because he called and said he wanted to propose and If I had any tips for him.

Three days later he comes to drop a wailing Anna off at our house with all of her belongings. Apparently, Anna's friend told him about the cheating. That is the only thing she told us through the crying Adam didn't say anything he just took her stuff out of the car and drove off. 

I was, and still am , deeply disgusted with my daughter. I did my best to raise her well and I can't believe she would do this. I am not able to offer Her any comfort or support because I just can't justify her actions. She is my daughter and I love her but I feel such deep disgust. What she did is despicable. I texted Adam, asking if he was okay. He said he'll be fine. 

As if these conflicting emotions regarding my daughter weren't enough, I have some about my wife and the way she is handling this.

My wife Mary as soon as she saw Anna crying started to yell at Adam asking what happened , cursing at him after he ignored her. Her reaction just added to my shock. I brought Anna inside while she was yelling and cursing. We comforted her, gave her water and sugar when she told us what happened through tears. My wife was shushing her , telling her it was going to be okay.  
But then she started saying things like ""you'll find someone better"" , ""he wasn't man enough anyway"" which disturbed me. She doesn't see anything wrong with what she said. I told Her that our daughter did something terrible and nearly got away with doing that to someone and that she shouldn't be validated . I'm not saying we should insult her, but we shouldn't validate her choices either. She disagrees and says she needs our support. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm disgusted by both of them , but at the same time they're my wife and daughter. This is the fourth day since it happened and Anna is posting on her Facebook things like ""Men are trash"" and badmouthing her friend  who told Adam. I dont really talk to her. Mary told me ""don't you dare talk to her about Adam"". I started spending more time out of the house. 
What do I do. I really need advice on how to handle this.

EDIT: I am now seeing posting on here was a mistake. Half of the people that commented have no business offering advice to anyone. I am deeply grateful and appreciative of all the helpful advice people offered, but now it has evolved into personal attacks and judgements of myself and some really hateful comments about women. To clarify, since a lot of you had trouble comprehending this : my goal is to support my daughter in a healthy way, without feeding into her misplaced victimhood like what my wife is doing.I do not think validating her attitude is going to do her any favours. In addition, I sought advice on how to get over this utter lack of morality, integrity and accountability both my daughter and wife have displayed in the last 5 days. I do not hate my daughter and I do not think saying ""this isn't about you"" is fair, since this impacted me directly, my view of the people closest to me and my relationships. Once again, thank you to all people that offered helpful advice and support.",1581268627.0,ThrowRAac_count,relationship_advice
I [19M] was assaulted a few months ago. My SO [25F] wants to open the relationship because I'm not satisfying her sexually any more.,"So, as the title says, I was sexually assaulted on NYE. It *really* fucked me up, I won't lie. Not just bc it was an assault and by default traumatic, but also because the whole thing was very similar to something that happened to me when I was a kid and it triggered some really deep seated trauma from that as well. 

It's fucked how I view sex. A few days after it happened my partner tried to initiate sex with me and I just burst into tears and couldn't do it. She was sympathetic, but naturally annoyed that she was being fulfilled sexually and had to take things into her own hands. I'm not that bad any more, I can push through and make myself do it now, but I have to kind of mentally disengage to be able to cope. 

I get why my partner is frustrated, I do. We've gone from having a normal healthy sex life to me being shit in bed. She's upset because sexual empowerment/fulfillment is a big deal for her and I'm just not giving it to her any more. I understand all of that. I'm trying my best to work through this shit, but it's difficult, you know? I trusted the people who assaulted me, and I still have to see one of them pretty regularly, and it took a real toll on my mental wellbeing. I just have this block now, which I'm finding I'm moreso chipping away at rather than busting through. 

Because I'm no longer any good for her in bed, my partner has told me she wants to open the relationship. She wants to go and have sex with other guys cause I'm just not fulfilling her any more. I won't lie. This is crushing for me. No hate to people who are poly/in open relationships. But the idea of it isn't for me. I told her I don't want that and she's said I'm being really selfish and not conidering her wants/needs and that it's not fair that her sex life should suffer because I'm going through some stuff. I feel like she's right, but I'm still really really upset about it. I just don't know how to handle this. Can anybody help?",1584443985.0,throwRAnotopen,relationship_advice
UPDATE: my bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status,"Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/go0ocs/my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Hi guys,
So I have my update here, and after mine, my boyfriend wanted to include a response from his POV. 
 
First of all, I want to say thank you so much for all of the support and well-thought out responses. The last couple of weeks were incredibly difficult and your words of encouragement helped me a lot. There was also a lot of great advice and I wish I could respond to everybody.

As for an update, my boyfriend spoke to his family first. One of the things they talked about was how I got HIV. I wanted them to know not because I vengefully wanted them to feel guilty, but because I don’t think I could let go of the resentment towards them if they didn’t understand how deeply this situation has hurt me, and that would require them to know about the trauma surrounding my status. He stood up for me and my boundaries, and explained my pain the best he could so that I didn’t have to do it and get overwhelmed.

A few days later, I spoke to my boyfriend’s sister. She apologized for telling their other sister and husband about my status. She of course was worried about my boyfriend and didn’t know what to do. I do wish she came directly to my boyfriend about it and that would have been the right thing to do, but I appreciate her apology. She let me know that I’m still welcome around her and her husband and that they won’t think of me any differently. That was a huge relief because I care a lot about his family and I was worried about being shunned. She also promised that nobody else would find out about my status from them. I assured her that I take my medication every day at the same time, get tested regularly, and do everything I’m supposed to do to stay healthy and undetectable and that her brother would be okay.

His mom is a different story, however. For a while, his mom wasn’t eating or sleeping or listening to any science about what it means to be undetectable. I haven’t spoken to her yet and have been encouraged by my boyfriend and his sister to not bother because as of right now, she has made up her mind about me as a threat. I’m pretty sure she’s convinced I’m going to kill her son one day. My boyfriend says that now, she seems to be doing better but I still haven’t been able to talk to her or go to her house and so I just feel stuck in this problem and that hurts.
His sister offered good advice, which was that any energy I would have put into trying to prove myself to her should be put into myself and loving myself. I’m still going to try, because I don’t want this burden to lie solely on my boyfriend’s shoulders, but I won’t exhaust myself to do so. She also said to not expect an apology from her because the reality is that it’s not going to happen and I need to cope with that sooner than later.

His mom did say she might change her mind if she heard from multiple doctors that I’m not a risk to him. I’ve gathered contacts from local HIV specialists, HIV education program directors, and infectious disease professors at a local university and will reach out to them when she’s ready.

My concern now is how my relationship with his mom will affect my relationship with my bf in the future. If she always views me as a threat and continues to worry herself sick, I’m worried that one day my boyfriend will feel like he needs to sacrifice the relationship for her health. Her behavior not only affects herself, but the family as well. But we’ll see how things go and if they get better as time goes on.

Another thing is, I know my boyfriend has tried his best to support me during this, but he’s not a very affectionate person and I don’t think he understands that I’m still struggling and need more reassurance than normal, even though I’ve tried telling him. It’s especially hard because I can’t go over there to see him and with quarantine, he can’t come to my home because I have roommates who of course aren’t comfortable with visitors right now. I’m worried that he’s going to change his mind about me, and I’m worried about future family events and what this whole thing means for us in the long-term. But I’m hopeful. My therapist helped me a lot with calming my nerves and coping with this whole situation. I think I’m going to start seeing her regularly again.

Also, a lot of people mentioned they didn’t realize how uneducated they are about HIV. Here are a couple resources that can help:

https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/livingwithhiv/protecting-others.html

https://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news/viral-supression-hiv-transmission/en/

Lastly, I received multiple messages from other HIV positive people. With something so stigmatized, it’s nice to remember that we’re not alone. I’ll try to respond when I can. We have to remember that we are so much more than our diagnosis and we are worthy of healthy love and dignity. Please take your medication every day, even when it’s difficult. A lot of has gotten better over the decades, and treatment and people’s behavior towards us will only improve.

 
From my bf:

Hi everyone! OP's boyfriend here. First I'd like to thank you all for the comments again. We both tried to read as much as we could and hear every opinion. To be blunt - my mom is a overly protective woman who's primary joy in life is her children. I can't think of a person who would quicker volunteer to sacrifice herself to save her children. It's beyond clear to me that her behavior is wildly irrational due to my life being at ""risk"". She is my family and I love her with all my heart. My girlfriend is also someone I love with all my heart. So when these two people are at odds I tend to become even more robotic than I already am. My natural reaction is to push this all in the past, handle the action points, reassess, and eventually cross the finish line. I think it is that desire to move past this ASAP that has me disjoined with my girlfriend. I'll address her aforementioned concerns with just a sentence or two. I try to engage in follow up discussions but I deep down believe they are adverse. It's one of those things built into my personality but, like anything else, can be improved with practice. If you have any advice for me at this stage I would love to hear it.


 Edit from my bf:

- I acknowledge my mom is completely and utterly in the wrong here. Her actions were/are detestable
- My action points are attending therapy with my gf, taking a course on HIV, updating myself on the latest research, and finally to lead the initiative to educate my mom in hopes of building a bridge between them and implement ideas to more effectively go about reassuring and supporting my GF

Edit from me:

I just want to say that while I appreciate the support, I think my bf has tried his best with what he knows how to do to help me with this. He knows he has things to work on and is looking for more constructive advice on how to be a better partner. I think that willingness to learn and become better is a huge green flag that I appreciate a lot. This is a pretty unique situation that I think most people would struggle with.

I know a lot of people are suggesting he cut ties with his mom. I think I would feel so guilty if that happened, even though I know it wouldn’t be my fault. My mother and I didn’t speak for years due to her toxic behavior and it was really painful for me. I wouldn’t want that for him. In a perfect world, I would like to find a way for her to become educated and accept me. Whether that’s possible is a whole other story. But I don’t want our relationship to come at the expense of tearing his family apart.

His current plan is to educate his mom because she thinks he’s going to die of AIDS. From there, he’ll reevaluate. Whether the that’s the best course of action is still being determined due to her current unwillingness to learn. I’m okay with giving that some time given he’s willing to step up in being more comforting and reassuring to me during this stressful limbo area. He said he will try, which I believe he will.",1591038284.0,ThrowRA22299,relationship_advice
My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",1570145712.0,ThrowRafanily,relationship_advice
I 25M ruin every second chance my 20F gf gives me. How do I learn to cope with past trauma to help me have a healthy relationship?,"My girlfriend, 20F, has given me opportunity after opportunity to be emotionally more mature than I have been in the recent past. I know we have about a 5 year age gap, but I don’t feel that’s been an issue for either of us. My problems 100% stem from childhood trauma. My mother became a drug addict at a young age, so then came promises that were never fulfilled, until at about 9 years old I wrote her a letter and told her I didn’t want to see her again until she was better. In this timeframe, my father had been seeing a woman who became that mother figure for me, she was a very important person for me to have while not seeing my mother. Well, at age 14, her and my father split and I never saw her again until after I graduated high school. Both of these scenarios I feel have led to me not being 100% emotionally available for the woman I love. In fact, I’m immature as hell. I’m jealous of certain things, I constantly tell her things that she does wrong which makes her feel nothing she does in enough, any time I have an opportunity to act like an ass I do. I constantly tell myself that she’s talking to someone else, which then led to last night when I saw a TikTok post she reposted that said “Me when I’m telling my homegirl about the fine shit I’ve been talking to” as soon as I saw that I called her out on it and refused to listen to any explanation she gave me. She said it was funny, I didn’t think it was. She asked me if I swiped right on the post (it was a 2 part TikTok post) I didn’t until see that part until the damage had been done. The second part of the post said “Me 3 weeks later cursing that man’s family” I realized in that moment that I had make a complete ass out of myself and very well could have ruined everything with her. It’s like I have this automatic defense mechanism to anything good in my life, and I try to ruin it before it ruins me but I realize now how unhealthy that is and I very well could have ruined everything with the love of my life, all because I had it set in my head that she was talking to other people. It’s almost like I wanted it to be true. How do I cope with this? Are there any coping mechanisms I can implement in my life so I don’t keep ruining my relationship or anything in the future? I’m at a loss with myself. Thank you",1730323433.0,Jmason56,relationship_advice
My sister said that she feels like she ruined my life,"My sister(15f) lives alone with me(22f)

About an hour ago she came into my room crying saying that she feels like she ruined my life. She mentioned that if it wasn’t for her I’d still be with my ex(he left because of her) and that she feels that she makes my life so much harder. I tell her that she makes my life better but I don’t think she believes me. What should I do

Edit for clarification:her last home wasn’t a healthy environment for her to grow up in and my ex hated how she was always at my side",1589510298.0,throwRAnotaburdon,relationship_advice
(update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

It all came to a head last night.  She just came out and asked me if I did not love her anymore and all that I could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

This started a larger conversation that I won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that I would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that I would have felt like I could have worked on it.  I would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  But to know that I was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something I thought I could get over any time soon or if I ever could for that matter.

I was even honest and said that if it was just a ONS she had or some random guy who was just huge I might be able to get past that.  But knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when I met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than I could handle.

She kept trying to tell me how much better I was at everything else and that I should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  I told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes I needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that I can never be.

I tried my best to be gentle, I tried to take all of the blame of stating that I knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who I am.  

BTW I'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

This is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  I am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  Everybody's Christmas is ruined.  We had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

This alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am I going to say is the reason why we are not together?  She didn't cheat and if I say that I felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  It's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

In the end I feel like a massive failure.  I feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and I feel like a failure because I wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

She has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially I said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  We can talk about every single thing and I can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who I wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what I do I will never be as good as her ex.  I just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

But because she legitimately seems heartbroken I agreed to go.  But that does  not mean I will keep going.  

Today I moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until I can get a place for myself.  She has been with her sister all day.  

I feel like shit.  

Thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  I honestly have tried to read everything even if I didn't reply to very many.

The bitch of all of this is that I still love her.  There is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

EDIT:  Well once again I posted this and then went away for awhile.  I went with my friend to see Mortal Engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so I started reading awhile ago.  It is going to take me forever to read and once again I don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  But thank all of you for reading and responding.

EDIT 2:  I guess I do want to share one thing I spoke with her about.  When we were having our very long conversation I presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  I know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  So I put the scenario to her like this.  I said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend Tim and you heard this.  ""Jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way Tiffany did""  ""But its not Jill's fault Tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person I've ever known and Jill just isn't as smart"".  Then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""I love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""Nobody makes a sandwich like you do and I think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
At first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   She ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  I then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw I would never say to anyone out loud about anyone I loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
EDIT 3:  If anyone even reads this I want to add one last thing.  People have been telling me what a whiny bitch I am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because I can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  Not going to lie and say I'm thrilled with it but I'm not dumb enough to think I have a giant magic wand or anything.  I had grown up believing what I now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  Some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  But even with that ultimately I might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  But hearing that no matter what I did, how much I loved her or any other thing that I was NEVER going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  Yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if I hadn't heard that I would never be the lover I think I might have been okay.  Well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  Yes I overvalue sex.  I get that.  Yes it is very important to me and well frankly I want to be wanted as much as I want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  Yes I know whoever I date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  But I would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later. ",1544831236.0,AlarmingMonk,relationship_advice
"UPDATE My (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. Am I being unreasonable in ending it?","Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbot23/my_29m_girlfriend_24f_cancelled_weekend_plans_to/).

&#x200B;

We spoke via text and then I called her at lunch. It escalated where I was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that I should trust her.

&#x200B;

I stated they can be friends, but I expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because I know better.

I expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

She doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200B;

I don't think she cheated. I know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. Accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

&#x200B;

She's a wonderful woman, she's just not the woman for me.

Should I (24M) leave my gf (24F) over her weight?,"Hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. Ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and I love her to bits. She is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200B;

She has gained alot of weight and is now obese. I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200B;

It doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.

&#x200B;

Theres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200B;

You can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200B;

Edit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.

I am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. If I dont see any improvment then I know there is no hope and will leave her. Thanks again you lovely people, I will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200B;

Another Edit: I cannot reply to all your comments but I have read most of them! Some of your stories have been great to read. A quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. She took it really well. To all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, I dont know because she would never tell me her weight. I really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but I shall know in a few months. I will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",1543617156.0,ILovemodash,relationship_advice
How do I compromise on closeness with my (46M) husband when I (44F) don’t want to be compared to his flings?,"I (44F) haven’t aged amazingly well. I am healthy and I do a lot to maintain myself but unfortunately genetically I drew the short end of the stick.

My husband (46M) confessed a few years ago that he lost attraction to me. He had withdrawn from intimacy. He still loved me as his wife, the mother of his children, and his best friend but he was no longer physically attracted. He is in great shape, handsome, charismatic. He’s been compared to a very attractive celebrity.

We had a lot of talks and worked out a deal. He would have a don’t ask don’t tell discreet flings with women. I have no interest in flings with men. I am very monogamous and need to feel comfortable with one partner to feel happy.

I still have a libido so I just pop into the guest room to take care of myself.

During that time I secretly met with a lawyer just in case my husband wanted a divorce. As a SAHM for years, I have little earning potential. My prenup was ironclad and if I filed I would get very little. If I divorced him I would end up in poverty, working retail for the rest of my life, never be able to own a house, never retire, and lacking healthcare. I don’t think my husband would be cruel in a divorce but divorces change people.

Our marriage was still strong even after the agreement. We laugh and we hug and we support each other. I’m happy with where my life is now.

A few days ago, we were celebrating an accomplishment of our son. After reminiscing about our lives and how we raised three beautiful children, my husband asked if we could be intimate.

I laughed and said my self esteem couldn’t handle him seeing me naked. After those fun flings with those beautiful women that I could never compare to, I would be so ashamed to show my saggy body. He said he understood. Later that night, I popped into the guest bedroom to take care of myself. I came back to our bedroom to find my husband crying. He’s been quiet and morose.

We talked a little bit last night and he said he missed our closeness but doesn’t have a right to ask for more. I told him that we were still close even if the sexual part of our relationship is over.

How do I maintain closeness with my husband under these circumstances? Edit: How do I build NON-SEXUAL closeness with my husband?

Edit: JFC stop suggesting I get plastic surgery.

"Boyfriend(M28) thinks I’m(F28)fat, but I’m not.","Me(F28) and boyfriend (M28) have been together for 12 years. 
Over the course of our relationship my weight has fluctuated a bit. 

For reference I’m 157cm/5’2 and my healthy weight is around 52kg / 114lbs.

I’ve always been very fit with a lot of natural muscle.
When we met I was 57kg, a bit chubby but not obese at all. From the moment we started dating he has been a bit obsessed with my weight, saying I’ve got great potential…
From age 15-20 this motivated me to get really fit, which escalated into me losing a lot of weight and getting anorexia which then became bulimia… I weighted about 42kg/92ldb.
Through a rough 5 years of this I finally got healthy and gained 12kg, then I got to my heaviest at 60kg.

For the past 4 years I’ve been taking good care of myself, stopped drinking alcohol and  I work out 4 times a week.
I‘ve been around 52kg / 114ldb for a while now but lately I’ve gained about 2kg. Which I personally am VERY comfortable with.
I LOVE lifting weights, but he hates it when I get bulky. 
Lately he’s been very “sad” and blames it on him not being attracted to me because I’m a bit fat and too bulky(???). 
I am absolutely NOT fat, and these comments makes me furious. I’ve told him that he’s hurting me, but he says he still loves me and that he would never leave me no matter how much I weigh.
Something in me wants to provoce him by getting super bulky and then maybe he will leave.
But at the same time I really really love him and want him to be attracted to me. 

Any advice on how I should get on about this issue?

UPDATE:
I eventually broke up with him in mid November and I’ve never been happier. Thank you so much for all your help. I really appreciate it ❤️

I (31f) am married to husband (36M) who is an underachiever. How do we create balance in our relationship and model a healthy relationship for our baby? ,"I (31F) have a masters degree and work a job with a salary of 75k or so. I’m not in a well paid field but I still act as the breadwinner which I find frustrating. My husband(36M) has a bachelors degree which he refuses to use for employment. Instead he works for a home improvement store making barely above minimum wage. We have a child (F 8 months) who I take on much of the responsibility now due to our schedules. I work Friday, Saturday, Sunday full time. Husband works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday full time. 

I’m mentally and emotionally exhausted from carrying our bill burden for the past 5 years we have been together, 4.5 living together. I pay rent, utilities, my student loans, my credit card and our car payment. We split vet bills and medical costs. My husband pays for his phone and groceries for the  past year or two has covered our internet. 

For context he has only had a full time job for 3 years with a lot of encouragement from me to get there. Before that he worked part time for family or at a pet store. 

Given our difference in strengths and income levels my husband takes on more of the physical labor in the home and I take on 85-95% of the mental load. 

I’ve expressed that taking on the mental load to this extent is not helping my mental health and that not being able to leave a toxic job since I can’t take a pay cut is physically draining. I’m starting to feel exhausted and trapped and like it would be easier to leave and move in with a friend or move back to my parents even though they are emotionally abusive. 

I’m not really sure what to do to improve things. I want to model a healthy division of mental and physical labor as well as financial burden for our child but we are not hitting the mark. 

We each have individual therapists and his has helped him some but I’m not sure they light a fire under him to keep achieving. 

My husband finally went to a state funded site to get his resume reviewed but I have been bugging him to do this for over a year. 

TLDR- I’m the breadwinner in our relationship and my husband makes barely above minimum wage and is a chronic under achiever. I want to make our relationship work.

Edit to add: of our bills I pay 2355 of bills that are the same each month plus variable expenses. My husband pays 400 a month to our expenses. 

I do almost all the child care. Home with little and responsible for any wake ups Sunday night when I get home from work around 8 until Wednesday around 10pm when my husband takes over one evening so I can get some solid rest. I then take back over almost completely Thursday, a responsible the Thursday overnight wake ups and getting little one ready for the sitter on Friday. 

I am also responsible for little one being ready for the day on Saturday and Sunday before I go to work and after work. 

Husband is only truly alone and caring for the child on Sundays as we have a friend come over on Saturdays so he can hang out with them/unwind and they do a lot of the work with the child- feeding and diapers ",1712342885.0,92artemis,relationship_advice
I (30F) realize I may have mistakenly accused my (now ex) bf (31M) of cheating after we've been broken up for a month,"Sorry if my writing is jumbled and incoherent, my mind has been racing and I can't think straight.

About a month ago my bf (now ex) went with his coworkers/friends to a bar/club (mostly a bar with typical drinks and bar food, but the place has a dance floor and music) after work. This is something they do every couple months or so. But this time, when he came home, he had a lipstick mark on his shirt. I asked him where the lipstick mark came from but he said he had no idea. I thought he may have been cheating on me with someone from work or someone at the bar (he was wearing his dress shirt from work that day). I've been cheated on in the past, which in hindsight might have made me think irrationally. But the couple days after that we fought several times due to me repeatedly questioning him abut that night and him denying anything had happened. I also snooped on his phone and computer to find evidence of cheating but didn't find anything, but he caught me snooping so we had arguments over that too. Long story short, I called him a liar and a cheater, broke up, and moved out the following week. The whole time he insisted he was innocent but I figured he was playing dumb and gaslighting me.

Last night I got dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and told her about the breakup. But when I told her about the lipstick, she gave me a concerned look and showed me a tik tok video of a girl at a club kissing random guys on the back without them knowing and leaving lipstick marks. Is this some sort of tik tok trend? As far as I can tell, the person who posted the tik tok is in Australia but I live in Los Angeles. The lipstick on my bf's shirt was on the upper arm/shoulder area, so I suppose it's possible someone could have come up behind him, kissed his shirt, and walked away without him noticing. I just never considered that to be a possibility.

I wasn't able to sleep all night, I've just been wracked with guilt that I may have been mistaken in accusing him of cheating. I've thought about sending him an email or giving him a call, but what do I even say? Before the lipstick ordeal, our relationship was the best one I've ever experienced, it was healthy and supportive. I realize in hindsight I may have treated him unfairly by not giving him the benefit of the doubt and I said some nasty things to him when we broke up. And there's also a small part of me that wonders what if he did actually cheat on me after all? If I bring up this tik tok, wouldn't an actual cheater jump at the opportunity to use it to continue to deny cheating? I'm afraid I may be overthinking this.",1661186888.0,throwralipstick,relationship_advice
I (30m) suffered a spinal cord injury last year that left me paralyzed and my wife (28f) has shown no interest in me sexually and there's no intimacy. What should I do?,"My wife and I have been together for 7.5yrs now we use to have a pretty healthy sex life. Ever since I've become paralyzed she shows absolutely no interest in me sexually she'll let me do stuff to her when it comes to me she will not do anything and won't really try anything either there's always some sort of excuse. I've tried talking to her on multiple occasions sometimes she just ignores me and walks away other times she will say ""maybe if I'm feeling up to it and not too tired"" which is understandable but it has now been almost a year and a half since I've even had an orgasm or even been touched. Everytime I try to do things by myself she will get pissed off at me which is a huge turn off for me and considers it ""cheating"". I have absolutely no privacy and a form of ptsd thinking she's just going to come into the washroom and get pissed at me which stops me from orgasming I don't even know if I'm still capable. She does a lot to help me out otherwise but I no longer feel like this is a relationship anymore it just feels like a patient and caregiver situation now but she also gets very angry easily. Am I being too impatient? I'm paralyzed but I still have needs and I'm still human I just feel like I disgust her now. So I need advice is there any way to fix things? Is my relationship just dead now? Am I living in a fantasy world waiting for something that'll never happen until she breaks up with me and finds someone new? Should I just leave? Am I asking too much?(no there is no other person either I trust her in that aspect)What should I do? Feels like the love is fading away daily

Update: wow a lot of replys sorry I haven't gone through the majority of them I have been rather depressed lately so I've stayed off of everything just trying to keep my head away from bad thoughts. 

I think I've decided to just leave she's not the type of person that would do couples therapy and this relationship has been spiralling downward for quite a few years even before my injury there was a lot of problems with no communication on her part only ""I don't want to talk right now another time"" which would never come or she plays the victim. Her attitude is just getting worse and worse. Too much damage has been done in this relationship to save it. 

To answer a few repeat questions I've seen: no it's not caregiver burnout I'm pretty independent the only thing I really need help with is getting on a commode other then that just getting in and out of bed because my side is against a wall otherwise I could do it myself. I have PSW's that come to my house 7 days a week for 2 hour durations. My level of injury is irrelevant as I am trying not to go into too much details I have control of my arms and most of my upper torso so I am independent in that aspect. No I don't believe I am being abused but I do believe she is trying to control me. Even when I try to end the relationship she just walks away and doesn't take me seriously when I'm just trying to discuss how to proceed forward in a civil manner rather then just leaving but at this point I think I just need to leave",1686008184.0,ThrowRA01239385,relationship_advice
"Update: My(28M) wife(27F) left me for 3 months and recently begged me to take her back, I said no and no everyone seems to be against me, I need some advice strangers","Let me start by thanking all the people who responded, there was a lot of insight, a lot of advice and a lot of support and while there were certainly a fair share of people just looking for an argument, insulting me, making offensive comments or trying to rope me in to something called mgtow luckily the vast majority of replies were great and stuff I could work with. Especially those who are in similar situations and those who are in said situation but are the depressed party proved to give me some insight I sometimes did not even consider.

Also I am sorry for not being able to respond to everyone, I really tried my best to respond but there were so many comments I honestly couldn't keep up anymore, but rest assured I tried to read just about every single comment so your advice likely did not go in vain and I appreciate it.

I ended up having a really good think about my entire situation, trying to weight out whether I would be able to give her another chance to begin with, as despite my post would give away was actually something I struggled with, I was a bit of an emotional mess after all and honestly I sort of lack/lacked control over my emotions, as you might have noticed in some of my responses some times I seemed nostalgic, forgiving and nice other times I seemed vengeful, resentful and hateful, I will admit of the bat that this is all me and like I told some people in messages, I was and still am not in the best of places emotionally. But I have been working on getting my own emotions under control the past few days and I can say I am in a better place then I was a week ago, but it will certainly take some more time for me to recuperate from all of this.

Now off to what people were likely looking to see, what ended up happening this week that made me decide to make an update post?

Well, after all that thinking I decided regardless of what course I would be taking as some people suggested, it would be my decisions and my decision alone, not the decision of my parents, her parents, friends or people on the internet, mine alone. A decision I would be the one living with at the end of the day.

So I decided I would inevitably end up regretting it all if I did not at the very least talk to my wife and get some closure. So that is exactly what I did, two days ago I decided to invite her to our home to talk about what us, our relationship, what I would be doing going forward, her depression and so forth, basically just to get it all on the table.

Now, it would be impossible to narrate this entire conversation and honestly it was about some very personal stuff so I would not want to even if I could, so I will instead try to break it down and give a summary of sorts.

We ended up discussing our entire relationship, I must admit it was very awkward and confronting as it was about a lot of stuff myself in particular had bottled up for so long it was very hard for me not to start yelling. I told her I was exhausted, I told her everything we had been trying obviously had not been working, I told her I felt like a doormat, I told her she was not the person I married, I told her these 3 months had been liberating for me, I told her I was tired of it all, I told her that I felt like she wasn't doing anything to help herself, I told her she was not doing anything around the house, I told her a marriage is supposed to be a partnership but I felt like I was basically married to myself and that I was the only partner in this relationship essentially I unloaded the stuff I had been feeling for years by now, I told her I had a hard time not regretting the day I married her at this point and while it obviously really, really hurt her to hear, she told me she knew, she knew I was unhappy, she knew she had been anything but a partner, she knew she was horrible about it all, but she felt like whatever she tried she always ended up fearing getting better, getting demotivated to do anything and that when she left she almost felt like she had burdened me enough, that it wasn't for her, but for me, but that she went about it the wrong way and ended up blaming the therapist as an easy way out, while it was true the therapist had guided her in some way towards this decision, the decision she made was for the right reasons but the explanation she provided was tailored to her, not to me, which was disregarding the therapists advice entirely.

She said she felt guilty about it all and that, that guilt was just making her psychological state even worse, she said she hated seeing me going to work, coming home exhausted and having to clean everything up, until I just passed out essentially(Which I might add is a massive step for her as she never admitted this.) But she started admitting a lot of stuff and apologizing for a lot of things in our relationship, she said her time away made her realize how much I mean to her and how much she took for granted and that she should have done better a long time ago. To which I told her, I felt like I had been enabling her essentially, while I had tried to keep her to her medication and all of that, at the end of the day it was always me picking up after her which probably made it easier for her to slip back in to it all.

Well after hours upon hours of talking we ended up hugging for what seemed like over an hour before going back to talking and she basically said she understood if I would not take her back, she understood if I did not trust her to get better, she understood that I was tired, but she asked me to give her one more chance and she would do anything for it.

I have to admit, my mind immediately wanted me to go to the obvious option, which was not taking her back, not giving her a chance, but honestly in this discussion, she was the person I was once in love with, she seemed to take ownership of things, she seemed different somehow, but I also knew the risks coming with taking her back and honestly I was not about to pull another hail Mary. So I told her I would be willing to give it a shot, but it wouldn't be like before, not at all.

I told her, she would have to prove she was going to put in the effort first, before we could even begin. Firstly I told her she had to get a part-time job, I don't care what sort of job, whether it is waiting tables, at a clothing store or at some company, it is irrelevant, as long as she made sure to go every single time she was supposed to go, look presentable when going and made sure she did her best at said job. Secondly she knows I like going to the gym, as such she would be going with me at least 3 times a week, get in shape again, get some exercise in but most of all be busy in a healthy way. Thirdly, she is going to help her parents around the house while she stays there, no more sitting in her room along with her thoughts, groceries, dishes, vacuuming whatever, she was going to make an effort doing it every single day. Fourthly as some people suggested, we were gonna go on a date once a week, no more escaping, not wanting to go outside, feeling self-conscious, no more excuses. Fifthly, We were going to do couples counseling, I know we tried before but we will try again. Sixth, She is going to go to a new therapist, not lie about anything anymore and do what the therapist tells her. Seventh, if the Therapist suggests medication, she is going to take them every time she is supposed to take them and I will keep them with me and she will take them in front of me, no more forgetting, no more not taking them, no more complaining and if there are issues with them we will try different ones but regardless, she is going to stick to it.

I told her, once we are doing all that we can go to the next stage of repairing our relationship, but until she does them and keeps them up for a good few months there is not a single chance I will continue our relationship(And yes I know ultimatums are a taboo on relationship advice but I don't think I have much of a choice.) To my surprise, she actually agreed and to my even bigger surprise despite it only having been two days she was actually helping her mother and father around the house yesterday and has been looking for jobs, her dad also said she seems a lot more cheerful. Now I know there is a long road left and I know there is a good chance this won't work out and that I should not cheer too early, but honestly I am hoping I get my wife back and I felt I owe it to myself to at least allow her this one last chance, call me an idiot for giving her this chance but well, perhaps I am an idiot.

That was my update, I am not sure whether I will make another, I had honestly not even planned on making this one, I want to thank the people who responded to my other post again for their insight and advice and I hope all of you live happily ever after or something haha.

"Fiance (36F) didn't want to sign a prenup with me (33M), got inheritance, now wants prenup","A little background here is that I make around $250k a year, my fiance makes around $65k a year. We've both been divorced. I asked for a prenup protecting my existing assets: two rental properties (worth around $400k together), my retirement account, my house which I live, existing savings account, and just sentimental things. I offered to pay for a lawyer for her, and make anything earned AFTER the wedding fair game in a divorce split. 

In my previous divorce my ex took a lot that I had before we ever even met each other, and took a lot of things with sentimental value just to hurt me. I floated the idea of a prenup and she was not OK with it. It hurt her feelings, and she said I was planning for a divorce if I want a prenup. She had this idea that when we marry everything becomes ours. We've been dating for 4 years, and had very few bumps so I don't see a super high risk of divorce but I do acknowledge it's there. Anyways, I love her, and I said sure. 

Fast forward a couple months, her grandmother abruptly died (wasn't expected. Grandmother was quite healthy before. Had a heart attack). Apparently the grandmother left the entire estate to her; Worth roughly $800k. Now, the tables have turned and she wants a prenup protecting ***these assets from me which I was fine with, but she doesn't want to sign my prenup in return for that.*** Her reasoning is that her grandmother wouldn't have wanted her wealth to ""leave her direct family and that there's a reason it was left all to me and not my siblings or parents"", and that the prenup must not have been important to me because I threw out the idea after minimal pushback... 

I'm at a loss here. In one regard I'm glad we had prenup discussions because it brought out these sides of us, but I'm really wondering if this 4-year relationship that has been full of nothing but love and support for each other until now is even salvageable. She's not willing to budge on her OWN prenup like I was, and I'm finding this whole situation very frustrating.",1596551397.0,throwRA_southparking,relationship_advice

In mid-December 2022, we discovered Sara was pregnant. Although it wasn't planned, we both welcomed the news, and the very next day we started getting ready to receive this baby in late August and prepare as much as possible. At birth, I was simply thrilled that both Sara and baby were healthy and didn't notice anything unusual regarding our baby's appearance. However, a few weeks later, I noticed a distinct shade of blonde in her hair, that’s not in any of our families, I didn’t want to be paranoid about it but also couldn’t get it out of my mind.

  
I tried mentioning this to Sara by phrasing it more like curiosity rather than an accusation, think something along the lines of: “from who do you think she got her hair?”. She reacted very defensively towards this question, despite me not pushing the subject, over the next days she started showcasing pictures of blonde family members, or articles about genetics, stuff like that. It obviously made me suspicious, so I started questioning why she was so hung up on that after only one question which led to a fight in which I told her I was going to have a DNA test and sort things out, she said it was fine and locked herself in her room.

  
Since she said it was fine to do it, I figured that there was probably nothing to hide but while I was at work, she left, just like that.

  
I arrived home, and she had left our baby with a neighbor who had no idea she wasn’t coming back, I tried to contact her but only got a text saying she needed space to think. First, I thought I had pushed her away with my suspicion, but after 3 days of no contact I finally decided to get the DNA test and turns out the baby isn’t mine.

  
After some digging, I suspect the father to be a coworker of hers, but I have no proof, anyway I got the news last week and literally have no idea what to do. Despite all this, I'm torn. I don't want to subject the baby to the hardships of the system and abandoning her doesn't feel right but staying like this also feels wrong. I'm overwhelmed and desperate, I literally just need a starting point to get everything sorted out. How does one recover from this? And how to move on? I mean is this baby always going to be a reminder of infidelity and abandonment? Has anyone else been here before?

  
Also, Sara’s family refuses to have anything to do with the baby. In case this information is important

  
TL;DR: My gf left me with an affair baby and I just don’t know what to do

To people in healthy relationships- what is the best way to interact with those of the opposite sex? I [26 F] need advice  for me and my boyfriend [37 M],"
I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 1 year now. I am jovial, bubbly and playful by nature.“Nice” is my default and am not overly assertive unless pushed to that point. I can’t stand infidelity and don’t intentionally invite any flirtation from men. I prefer not to go out without my boyfriend present just out of respect for our relationship (personal choice- he never asked me to do that). But my boyfriend recently expressed to me that he feels as though he can’t trust me in situations because even though i reject advances from men in the chance I’m approached to begin with, it’s “how” I reject them that he takes issue with (being nice about it and not being as assertive) because that could still be seen as an invitation. This conversation came about to begin with because a few weeks ago, he invited me out with him and his friends. Toward the end of the night one of his friends started telling me this story about him and my boyfriend but because the music was too loud, he leaned in to speak to me. My boyfriend was next to us and I was listening and nodding as he spoke. But because he was leaning in and I was in a corner by a wall, it looked like he was getting too close. I didn’t think anything of it or even realize it looked a certain way because of the nature of the conversation and becuase of the fact that my boyfriend was right next to us. One of the other guys in that group then asked this friend to come with him for something else and pulled him away. My boyfriend expressed that he was very uncomfortable with how the interaction looked and was upset with me for not creating more distance and for allowing the conversation to continue as long as it did. I feel terrible that I’ve given him this perception and really want to make sure I don’t do anything to make him uncomfortable in future. I realize that I can’t realistically avoid interaction with men completely. I know that I need to be more assertive just for the sake of my own self lf respect  and now more than ever for the sake of my relationship. But in addition to that, how do you recommend going about future interactions with the opposite sex in an appropriate manner?",1720814108.0,ThrowRAranildabeast,relationship_advice

First things first: I had my healthy baby girl on Monday evening. We were discharged shortly after birth due to Covid so I have been just trying to adjust to everything. Her birth was a dream and I never want to do it again. Lol. 

Second: I talked to his wife for over an hour yesterday. I guess he decided to tell her. She wasn't mad at me, thank God. She'd had her suspicions but was trying to trust her husband which I understand. She was so nice honestly and even though she isn't angry at me I still feel bad because she's such a nice lady. She wanted to make sure I was doing okay and that I didn't need anything which made me cry because postpartum hormones are whack. She's getting a divorce from him (good for her tbh). We are planning to meet up and talk shit about him once the virus is over. 

I have a lawyer and will establish custody and child support legally asap. He hasn't bothered to contact me at all but I don't particularly care. 

I didn't want to leave anyone hanging even though it's not a huge update. Thank you to everyone who checked in. It means a lot.",1587671233.0,throwRA-idkwhattosay,relationship_advice
"What's everyone's score in this ""is your relationship healthy?"" Quiz? (I'm 26f partner 29m)","Link:  https://www.loveisrespect.org/quiz/is-your-relationship-healthy/?%3E

So I came across this quiz on a different post and people were commenting their results (46,33,67...) all really high numbers and talking about how it cannot be.

I (26f) did the quiz and I got 1 I answered it all honestly about my fiance (29 m) and I. If it matters, we've were together for 5 years and now engaged for 6 months. 

At the end it says what each score means. 0 is healthy relationship, 1-2 small problems that can be worked on, 3-4 signs of abuse and 5+ is an abusive relationship. 

So 5+ is abusive and there were people who got score well above 30. I'm curious to know what other people are getting and maybe why?

Surely most people aren't getting above 5

My (M42) wife (F43) gets angry at our kids and only refers to them as mine. How do I get her to stop and apologize to our kids?,"This is confusing and I think just stupid. My wife and I have 3 kids together. Two girls, one boy. These are all our biological children. 

My kids are at that age where they're finding themselves and learning what their interests actually are. Lots of self expression. I'm a very open minded guy and I don't care what my kids are doing as long as they're healthy, safe, and most importantly, happy. One of my daughters is going through her emo phase (lol, I had one too at her age). My wife doesn't like this at all. She absolutely despises it and criticizes her every time she sees her with her makeup and black clothes. She wants her to dress ""normal"" in her words. I don't care, like I said. I'm the one who bought my daughter the clothes in the first place. 

My wife has been doing this thing as of late where when she's angry, she'll make snide remarks disguised as compliments, and then get offended when called out. I call her out when she does this to our children. I think it's incredibly immature and downright cruel to do to kids, especially *our* kids. She'll then claim that we're all ""dogpiling"" on her and that she's sorry for being such a concerned mother who wants her kids to be normal. I've had multiple conversations about this with her.

I think this is where her behavior came from, but I'm not sure. When she gets mad about the way our kids are dressed now, she says things like ""look at how *your* daughter is dressed"" and ""go get *your* son before I say something to him"". I don't like this. Our kids are starting to hate their mother for a variety of teenage reasons and this isn't helping at all. I don't want their relationship to deteriorate because she can't handle a bit of black clothing.

My son is the last to figure out his own style so he's been starting to latch onto his older sister's sense and music. My son was always a ""mommy's boy"" before this so it's driving my wife insane. He painted his nails black last week and his sister did eyeliner on him, and my wife nearly passed out from shock. This caused her to demand he take it off, scolded our daughter, and made her cry. My wife had then called me while I was at work telling me that I ""better come get my kids"" before she ""gives them a reason to hate her"". I luckily got to go home, and when I got there it was a bit of a wreck.

My son was fuming on the couch and my two daughters were nowhere to be found. When I asked him what happened, my wife came storming out of the kitchen ripping me a new one for allowing this kind of disrespectful behavior. While she was yelling, my son said that he hated her. She shrieked at me to ""control my kid"" and I could see how hurt my son was to hear that. He went up to his room without a word, and I calmed my wife down enough to get the story in her words before telling her that she can't do that and needs to apologize. She hasn't as far as I know.

She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since and I'm honestly just tired. I don't give a damn what my kids are wearing or what type of music they're listening to. I know from first hand experience that if a kid can't do something, they're going to find a way to do it and start lying and sneaking around, and we all know how that can end. I don't want that. I want open communication and a great relationship with everyone. This is stressing me out.

How do I get my wife to apologize and stop saying these things? They're *our* kids and I know this rift is going to only get larger. My wife is beginning to resent me too I think.

Edit: Just to add some things, I would go to war for my kids, lol. My children weren’t showing signs of depression, just dabbling with style because it’s popular on TikTok. I had a shitty upbringing and vowed to be the best dad I could. I’m trying. I’ve tried to keep most of this fighting behind closed doors as well. I don’t believe in your kids being involved in the fighting between parents. I’ve been paying close attention to my kids and went out to eat on my day off with my two that are having problems with their mother. I bought my other daughter a new makeup thing for your eyes to show her that I didn’t forget about her either.

My wife was not always like this. My wife was great with the kids and always a very even tempered woman. I have no idea where this behavior came from but it is concerning. Shes never mistreated our kids and used to be the proud mommy in the crowd at their school plays. No one is interested in therapy at the moment, but I especially want to get my wife the help I think she needs. She was always a very supportive, positive woman and that’s why I fell in love with her. I do not want to divorce, but if it truly came down to it, I’d be fighting for full custody. I don’t care if our kids wear some makeup, are goth, gay, into sports, D&D or whatever else it may be. They’re my babies and I’ll fight tooth and nail if it comes down to it, but I pray that it doesn’t. I love everyone involved. ",1715297562.0,ThrowRA_InkCard23,relationship_advice
My (29F) BF (29M) spent 8k at a strip club…,"Boyfriend and I have been dating 2 years, are financially independent, split bills and chores evenly, and have a sexually healthy relationship. We usually do dates once a week. 

A few months ago my boyfriend went out to a music show. I didn’t go because I had work early that morning, and work again the next morning. I woke up around 5/6am and saw he wasn’t home. I got worried, checked his location and saw he was at a strip club. At the time he wasn’t aware that I was not okay with strip clubs. He ended up coming home about 30 minutes later, crying, and drunk. He tells me he spent 8k. I’m not joking…8k. He says he spent it on bottle service, drinks, and lapdances. He swear he didn’t cheat and even offered for me to “smell him” down there which I said no to. 

We had many long discussions about this, and he even tried to get the money back through the bank. I ended up having to trust that this was a mistake and hopefully a lesson learned for him. I told him I don’t want him going to a strip club again, even though I feel like I should be a “cool girlfriend” I’m not okay with it and feel it borders on legitimate cheating. 

Now, a week ago he and a friend decided to go out to get some drinks. Okay, well I woke up for work around 4am to see he’s at..a strip club. I call and call, no answer. He tells me he will call me back and the police are there. I’m worried but I have to go to work. At work, he calls me and tells me he and his friend “went to a club”, but got jumped? Then he says that he spent most of his time there in the strip club office with the manager (for reasons unknown but he was also crazy drunk) but I’m assuming it had something to do with his card or the amount of money. He showed me his bank statement showing they took a total of 2 transactions equaling to about 7-8k. He says he did not approve that amount, but I haven’t been able to bring myself to ask him more on this situation.
I’m beside myself in anger, sadness, and disappoint. I don’t know what to do from here, I love this guy and every aspect of our relationship is wonderful. However, I don’t want to an “idiot girlfriend” when it comes to this. I have hesitations as to why he would want to even go to a strip club, and if he’s “happy” why is he sabotaging our relationship and disrespecting me as his partner? 

TLDR: Bf went to strip club, spent 8k, he says he didn’t cheat. Now, he’s lathering, rinsing, and repeating.",1689544018.0,ThrowRAWise-End2882,relationship_advice
My (38m) gf (36f) has an extremely toxic relationship with her dad. How can the two of us have a healthy relationship?,"My girlfriend works with her dad, and their relationship is totally dysfunctional. This word gets thrown around a lot but he truly is a narcissist. Was recently convicted of some pretty awful crimes and just started a five year prison sentence.

I notice that her and I argue a lot. When we do, she throws tantrums, yells and screams, can’t control her emotions, and does tactics like gaslighting and stonewalling etc. Any sort of “hey when you do this it makes me feel this” is met with lashing out, defensiveness etc.

She puts it on me and says it must be me because she’s never argued this much with an SO before. The only problem with that is I hear her conversations with her dad every day, and they argue the exact same way. She hangs up on him, yells at him, gives him the silent treatment, and they both use trickery, passive aggressiveness, and say mean things to each other. 

I’m wondering, if she doesn’t see how her relationship with her dad is being played out almost exactly with us, will we ever be able to get to a place where we can resolve conflict in a healthy way?  Also even if she is able to see this at some point, what can be done for someone with this kind of ongoing relationship with their dad to have a healthy romantic relationship?",1731957810.0,ThrowRA-5667899,relationship_advice
Limited physical relationship in 5+ years of marriage between 35M and 32F. What can I do to kindle the romantic angle in me to keep this relationship healthy? ,"I am '35M' and in a very confused stage of my life. I have been married with my wife '32F' for 5+ years now. 

Both of us get along very well and we know that we like and love each other. We do a lot of things together and we absolutely have fun. In spite if all of this, we have had very very limited physical relationship in all these years. We are living more like best friends or rommates and missing that romantic angle at all. She does make some gestures sometimes, but I seem to not recognise them. I ask her sometimes and she is not ready.

This has started causing strain in our relationship off late as we are being pressured by families to plan for a baby soon.

"My(28M) girlfriend (25F) wants me choose an in-state school, over my dream law school. Is the relationship worth the compromise?","My girlfriend (who we'll call Sarah) and I have been dating for about 7 months and we are talking about our future together. She has a 6 year old child and lives in small town 3 hours from me so the relationship has had its struggles. I have been studying for law school and Sarah knows that it is my dream to go a top-tier law school. Doing so would provide me with the opportunities that I desire out of a legal career. Sadly, none of these schools are in the state we live in, and she is doubtful she can get her child's father to let them move out-of-state. Sarah is trying to get me to settle for my in-state school (located in the city where I live) which is decent, but no where near the level of a top school. She says we always can try to move later. I have tried to remain open to this, but as the relationship progressed, I can't deny how badly I want to live, study, and work somewhere else. At one point I expressed this to her and she said she would fight in court so that we could move out of the state, but she hasn't mentioned it since and has reverted to pushing for the in-state school. When I try to explain the obvious benefits of other schools, Sarah gets really upset and feels that I only want to be with her if it's convenient.

As far as the relationship goes, we have had our struggles and disagreements. It's not perfect, but it is generally healthy. A couple of times Sarah's gotten angry that I refuse to move to her town. I set the boundary early on that I would never live there as I absolutely hate it. I try my best but as a city kid, I definitely don't belong and it gets to me. Despite this, I still spend a significant amount of time there visiting her. Ultimately, I don't want to be trapped in our home state and I have been experiencing extreme anxiety about the whole situation, to the point where I am taking medication and seeing a therapist to address it.

I'm wondering if I should end a good relationship and strive towards my own goals or settle for the in-state school and hope I can be content and build a happy life.

I’m (37F) in a healthy relationship. Why am I so worried about him (40M)? ,"We have been dating for almost 4 months. So far it’s the healthiest and, sadly, longest relationship I’ve been in since my first boyfriend over 17 years ago. (Dating is hard people!)

That first boyfriend (James) cheated on me and it was devastating. The trauma left me with a physical illness that I am still dealing with today. 

I’ve dated lots of men since James but now that I’m with Joseph, I’m worried Joseph may cheat on me. Joseph is great and I love him. Because of my anxieties things have been a bit rocky and strained which has made me feel more anxious. We still see each other and go on dates but lately he’s been spending more time with friends and forgetting to text back (he has adhd but his texting was never that bad before. Perhaps he was fixated on being with someone new?) We discussed my issues and he’s been pretty good about putting my fears at ease although there are times when he initially wants to leave (not leave the relationship but leave the house - he has a bit of an avoidant). 

I can’t get out of my head. I hate that I’m hurting Joseph and it’s straining our relationship. I don’t know what to do. 

I was with him Sunday evening into Monday evening (I spent the day working from home at his place). I texted him when I got home about tentative plans we made for the weekend we exchanged two messages and then I didn’t hear from him until I texted him on Wednesday just after lunchtime… when we finally spoke he said he forgot to text me back because he was with his friend the other night, then he was working on some stuff for his place. Lately he will forget to text back or I won’t hear from him for a day or two.  

He’s been less affectionate but I don’t know if that’s because he’s just comfortable now or loosing interest. He said he’s not a super affectionate person but he was very affectionate when we started dating. We spoke again on Thursday about what’s going on and he maintains that he isn’t cheating but he gets frustrated with me and says I’m too emotional over things that don’t matter. I self regulate but I honestly just want reassurance from him. Am I asking for too much? Last night I told him we should seriously consider if we should still be together. Did I make a mistake? Am I valid for feeling this way? 

UPDATE: It wasn’t anxiety. My intuition was spot on. I wasn’t hurting him. He pulled back because he wanted to break up.",1731676438.0,ThrowRA_frostsnow,relationship_advice
My partner [41/f] and I [36/m] of 8 months what are Healthy and unhealthy boundaries in a relationship?,"\[36/m\] My partner \[41/f\] has many long-time male friends (she grew up as a tomboy, so she has very few female friends, maybe five or so total). Anyway, a few of her friends were coming to visit (2 male friends), and I asked to hang out with her and her friends, but she was reluctant to agree. I didn’t push it, but the next day, she agreed to let me come, which was good, I think. I just don’t understand why she wouldn’t want me to go. I've met a handful of her other friends and all her family.  We have been dating for 8 months and have a very close and healthy relationship. We’ve planned the future together and have many other positive things to say. She is very supportive, respectful, and compassionate, so I really don’t have much to worry about. I also struggle with Abandonment anxiety, which I am getting therapy for, and I am improving. She knows this and is very supportive of it in every way. However, this got us talking about healthy boundaries. So, the questions are about what would be considered healthy and unhealthy boundaries. Such as the following:



\- Hanging out with someone of the opposite sex one-on-one would not be okay. But if there is more than one person regardless of gender, would that be okay?

\- Is it okay to want to meet your partner's friends and hang out with them with your partner? Is it okay if they don’t let you meet them?



tldr: just want some advice on what reasonable boundaries would be to have.

My boyfriend (25m) got a happy ending massage and I (26f) don’t know what to do. How do I move forward? ,"Update:

He’s for the streets and I’ll be moving on, healing, and living my best life. For those concerned, yes I had permission to look at his credit card statement/charges. We lived together and shared money. No, the receipt didn’t blatantly say happy ending, but I’m not an idiot and am capable of putting 2 and 2 together. I am getting tested and hoping his nasty self didn’t give me anything, and that establishment has been reported to two different agencies. I originally posted while still very emotional and terrified because I am in love with him. But I love myself more and I, just as everyone else, do not deserve anything less than a healthy, honest and loving relationship.

My boyfriend 25M and I 26F have been together for 2 years. We had an extremely rocky start, but the last year and a half has been nothing but incredible. On Sunday we got into a huge fight. He left the house and went to “drive around to clear his head”. Fine, no issue there. Well last night I was looking at his credit card statement, and he had 2 charges for a massage place 5 minutes from where we live. This made me a little sus and after some more digging I found google search history for where to get a happy ending. I asked him where he went when he left, and he was insistent on no where. After the third time I asked, he said okay fine I got a massage. Which wouldn’t be weird if the search history wasn’t what it was. He swore to me nothing happened, and the second charge was a mistake that he was disputing. I didn’t buy it and called asking why there were two charges. The lady I spoke with sent me 2 signed receipts. He got a happy ending massage. I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I’m hurt and angry and all around confused. He’s been nothing but apologetic, says it won’t happen again. But I’ve heard that so many times with past situations. I don’t know what to do. Leave? Work through it?

How do I (34M) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34F) that has no life skills?,"Genders are actually reversed, he knows I've been browsing this sub lately and I'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

I'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. He has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. He never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. It's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. None of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

I feel like a bad person, but I don't see a future together that I want. I just wish I'd come to this realization sooner.

We have no kids, only 3 cats. We're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). Only thing I can think of is he's on the bank account, but I doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. I'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... We've paid off about 40k of it. Or technically, I have.

He's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and I worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. I still care very much for him, but I can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

How do I break up? I don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, I want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

Update : I told him I wanted to break up. Said this wasn't the life I wanted, and that I gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. I'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this Thurs to work on any sticking points.

Then left the house. He wants to know why now, why can't I give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. I had to leave, or I'm going to start saying things I regret or break down. Not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so I won't be bored (what can i say, I'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

I'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

Update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. I lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

I didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. I had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, I'm going to leave it up. Its not that I'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. I knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). I'll try to post other updates too. I appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. Sorry if I don't have time to reply to everyone.

And if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close I can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. I'd rather you didn't read this.

Update #3 : He's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. No logistics have been discussed except it sounds like I won't see him for a bit. I've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. Have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. They all heard from him first, except his sister who I gave a heads up to (with no details). It's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I want these people to be there for him when I'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

I'm not sure I should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. Gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. Not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

I'm tired and think I can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as I sorted this all out. Will try to respond to questions later.

Update #4 : I really appreciate all the support, it's more than I can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when I need it. And I've needed a lot of it.

He's back and staying in a separate room for now. This is his home too, I'm not going to force him out the first night when I've already ruined his life. I planned to keep my distance, but I'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes I sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. He knows he fucked up. I'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him I want it done by the end of the month. If he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

Also I'm seeing a lot of questions about if I'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man I needed. I don't know. I'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, I'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when I'm ready to go looking again. I know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. He's been my best friend for 16 years, and I still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. We grew up together and been through a lot. I don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and I changed. I'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and I'm the one that changed to realize I was not ok with it anymore too.

And to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. Maybe for some it is, but that's not who I am. I want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. And is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. This has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. I want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone I have to fight and drag along.

Thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. I'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. Maybe I'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

Update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than I thought. I thought my tears would be done by now. The optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person I need. I miss and love him so much. But I've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. The support here keeps me going, I can't tell you all how much I appreciate it. It's going to be a rough few weeks, but I can do this.  I keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

Like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. I feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

The lack of support for me has been hard. Only his mom has asked how I've been, and wanted my side. I think she understands. We were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. I knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. I'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. But I still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people I know. Maybe I'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

He's I think out of the house for good now. Not sure, but I told him either he goes, or I find a temp apartment this week. He left while I was sleeping and hasn't been back. I haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. He's a good guy, I wish I had said a better goodbye. Given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. I know it's better this way, I can't be the one there for him now. It hurts, but I know it's for the best

Update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and I didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. I consider that progress. Some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. Each time it happens, I try to identify the cause. Usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt I've caused someone. It's hard not to miss him, but I feel a lightness about being free. And I'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. Bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. I'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment Thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

I've barely seen or talked to him since I broke it off. I don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. I said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it Thursday. I really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. Misses him so much, not eating much. She's 20lbs, and loves food. He stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that I just gave her. I try to show her extra love, but I can tell she misses him. And he probably misses her.

I've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. And writing in a private diary document. It's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. For example, if I start thinking maybe I could have tried another ultimatum, I can just go back and re-read what happened the first time I gave one. Or if I get to feeling I could have tried harder, I can go back and read all the things I did try over the past year. Writing it out and talking to others really does help.

How to get over anxious attachment in a healthy relationship? 27F 29M,"Hi everyone, 

I’m after some advice and also an excuse to air out how I’m feeling. I have been in a fantastic relationship for 7 months, I am 27F and he is 29M.

So for contact, me and my ex split up early this year after our 8 year relationship. This wasn’t a surprise as such, we no longer found each other attractive, he was actively flirting with girls in front of me and well, I’m glad it has finished to say the least. Fast forward 2 months later, I met my current boyfriend! I must admit I went on dates with guys as a distraction but when I met my boyfriend, it felt like I’d known him for years, we instantly hit it off. Now at that point, I wanted to slap myself in the face because I hadn’t given myself enough time to heal from my previous breakup. Even though things were rocky, the hurt I felt when my ex split up with me I’ll never forget, I mourned him as a best friend than a lover. ANYWAY, 8 months later our relationship is fantastic, we’ve met eachothers friends, family, co workers and were madly in love. We’re even planning on moving in together next year. 

However, the last couple of months have been very bumpy for me with my mental health. When me and my bf are together, my mind is at peace and I’m so happy. When I’m alone, my mind is overcrowded by negative thoughts like: “what if all of a sudden he leaves me”, “what if he no longer loves me but is scared to say”, “what if he is cheating on me”. It’s ridiculous when I say it aloud but that is truly how I’m feeling. I haven’t spoken to him about this as this is something I have got to face on my own, I don’t want to burden him with everything I’m feeling as that’s not fair, he has done nothing for me to feel this way. It’s just really getting me down recently to the point where I hate being alone. I know this has stemmed from my breakup and I wish I’d met my boyfriend at a time where mentally I was ok. But the universe has a weird timing for things and I met him when I hadn’t healed. So naturally, this has developed into attachment anxiety. 

For context on our relationship, thankfully my boyfriend is very open with communication. He is not an avoidant person at all, he’s not scared to show his feelings. But before he met me, he was single for a couple of years, so naturally he is very independent, like time to himself etc.

Sorry for the essay, has anyone else experienced anything similar? I want this relationship to work, I love him so much. But I don’t want my mental health to jeopardise things. 

Thanks guys!",1733686665.0,Fit-Dragonfruit-8849,relationship_advice
My (30M) boyfriend of 6 years doesn’t want to have sex with me (30F). Is this healthy in a relationship? ,"Me and my bf have been together for 6yrs now and we have a baby together. We are intimate maybe 2/3 times a year and that's only when I mention that he doesn't want me sexually anymore. Whenever I try to initiate sex he says he's tired or sleepy. 

When I ask him if he's not attracted to me anymore he says that's not it, that there’s nothing going on. Some days I even get all dolled up and dressed up for him. To see if that does the trick, but he doesn't even notice. I'll try to initiate sex, like today I laid my hand over his private area after I kissed him while we watched tv in bed and he casually moved my hand away. He scooped my hand up with his and moved it away and just held my hand, but it felt like he just did that in hopes that I wouldn't notice him dodging my advances. He doesn’t kiss, hug, or compliment me unless I bring it up which I shouldn’t have to. He just feels like a roommate that I’m desperately trying to get the attention of. I’ve caught him in the past looking at other women online or porn and apparently he’s stopped now but I’m starting to believe that’s not the case. Every time he says he’ll stop then a few months later I catch him again. 

This is really starting to affect me and my confidence. I feel unattractive and unwanted. I have mentioned how I feel to him multiple times in the nicest way possible but my bf just says that I want to start an argument and that I love to argue by “pressing him”.

"My GF 25F threatens to end her life when I 23M want some space, is it healthy continuing this relationship?","My gf 25F who is very clingy dating on &off for 2yrs, wants to go out 7 days a week, we are still in med school. Whenever I spend time with others like my friends and family, she gets jealous and starts a fight about how I leave her. She gets angry at everybody I talk to and gets mad at me for talking to them too.
Recently I realised that she is obsessed with me so I wanted her to engage in something else other than me. So I started to tell her that I’m not feeling well and would probably go to my parents house for a break.
But she didn’t want me to go, so she didn’t give me her approval of me going to my parents house.
Then the next day I really became ill and slept early, thus I missed some of her calls.
This made her block me in texts and I just utilised this reason and ignored her that morning. This prompted a very focused response from her part and she started calling and texting a lot. I then realised that she is obsessed with me rather than giving me some space, moreover she also threatened to end her life and blame it on me if I don’t talk or get back to her. This made me so sad and afraid that I complied. 
It made me feel afraid of her and that incident repeated itself 5days later upon which I was very terrified of her ending her life because of the minor fights that we have.
The last fight where I was like we should probably separate and end this relationship, for which she threatened to publically say that I raped her and file a complaint to the police. This shattered me, the woman I love is threatening to end her life for small fights and now she’s forcing me to stay with her by rape threats which is totally a lie as we did sex voluntarily and either of us gave consent and all.
Now I am not talking to her, she constantly is trying to get me back by using sex, sympathy and threats but I am still not complying to her.

The main problem is she is not ready to let me go, on the other hand I feel like I fear her more now than I love her.
The fact that I don’t want her is not affecting her at all, she just keeps pressuring to get back to me.
Any advice ppl on how to end it? (PS She’s also mentally unstable, might actually commit suicide, but I don’t want that to happen)",1728834151.0,Raman_917,relationship_advice
My [26F] boyfriend [29M] spanked his daughter [3F] in front of me,"[**EDIT: UPDATE POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zuxynd/update_my_26f_boyfriend_29m_spanked_his_daughter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

My boyfriend, ""Nate"", and I have been together for 4 and a half months, so it's still relatively new. Our relationship progressed pretty quick because of 2 things: we were both recently out of very terrible long-term relationships so it was easy to lean on each other for support, and I accidentally met his daughter very early on. 

Nate's daughter is lovely. I adore her. She's autistic and a bit behind with language so she acts younger than 3, but she's an absolute joy to be around. I knew before meeting her that he spanks her on rare occasion and the only boundary I put down about my being around his kid is that I did not want him to spank her around me. He agreed to that and it hasn't been an issue until last night. 

She was cuddling up to me on and off after dinner and bit my arm a couple times. Once bad enough for me to verbally go ""ouch!"" but not any sort of long-lasting pain or anything. I just moved my arm away the first time and got up after she did it a second time 🤷‍♂️ Nate told her in a stern-but-gentle way to not bite. A few minutes later he was cuddled up to me and his daughter was clambering over out little cuddle puddle, and she bit his arm too. 

Nate spanked her as an automatic reaction and it freaked me the fuck out. Like, no hesitation between the being bit and swatting his daughter. It was just 1 smack but that's still more than I think any child should be hit and it was really jarring that not only did it happen in front of me, but also when they were both snuggled up with me. I froze and got very quiet, his daughter ran around crying for a bit, and he gave me space for a while (about an hour) to calm down before we talked.

Two important points about my needing space after that: I was beaten pretty badly by my father on a regular basis as a child, and I am also autistic. When something upsets me very much, I ""go nonverbal"" and feel like I physically can't talk until I've self-regulated into a calmer headspace. Nate knows all this and was very sweet and gentle about giving me space when he saw how I clammed up after the spanking.

When we talked I initiated it over text because even though we were in the same room, I was struggling to verbalize my feelings about it. I basically just reminded him that I had asked he not do this around me and that I wouldn't see him anymore if it happened again, that redirection and guidance should be the go-to for situations like that, and that his daughter isn't old enough or cognitively able yet to understand why she's being hit. After I got that out we talked a bit verbally and he expressed that he knows (he used the word ""knows"") I'm right, but that he was also feeling defensive. I decided to head home and we hugged before I left. 

We haven't really talked since last night, he sent me a couple snaps today of his daughter lookin' cute and we talked about the snow a little. I'm waiting for him to initiate more conversation about it since I don't want to make him feel attacked ig? 

I don't know what to do or say beyond this. I really like him, I love his daughter, I don't want her to be hit, if he keeps spanking her (especially if it happens around me) I am going to leave but I also dont want to leave his daughter without an adult around who will defend her when things like this happen. What do I do? Where do I go from here? Did I handle it ok?

Pro-spanking comments will be very much ignored. Don't hit children.

Edit: I am realizing now after this event, that my asking him to just not spank her around me was a sort of bullshit request. I don't want to be with someone who hits their kid, whether or not I am present for it happening. So I have that thought and feeling to figure out how to communicate when Nate and I talk next.

Edit2: This post has been up for about 4 hours and holy shiiiiit I did not expect this level of response. To bring clarifications I made in the comments up into the post and to address some questions/statements people have: 

- I won't consider advice from people stating they're pro-spanking because I don't think kids should be hit, period. There's a boatload of science on how adversely it affects children and some lovely people have linked to a number of these studies in the comments. 

- Meeting her so early was an accident, and I followed Nate's lead on what to do after the fact. I know and understand that I met her incredibly early & I plan to do my absolute damndest to avoid meeting a small child so early again if I date another single parent. 

- I'm a bit confused about all the accusations of me telling Nate how to parent. Hitting your child is literally illegal in some places and there's a bunch of studies detailing out how it messes with brain development; more than anything all I've done is set a boundary for myself and open a line of conversation to help him learn about that science, it's not like I'm trying to force ideas about how he should feed or play with his daughter. 🤷‍♂️

Thank you to the small handful of level-headed, nuanced commenters that've given advice. I appreciate you.

**UPDATE**

Disappointing probably 80% of the comments section here, I have not left him, called CPS, or learned my place as a lowly gf of 4 months. 

What I did was send him this post, to read through my POV and all the comments so that we could collaborate on the solution to this together. So many people discouraged communication that it really cemented my feelings of just how important healthy communication about this topic is, especially with someone I would prefer to keep in my life if positive change is possible with this issue here. 

I might do a full update when all the talking shakes out, but for now: we're still together, and he's going to try and stop doing this. 

Thanks to everyone who gave nuanced advice between the points of ""leave him"" and ""hitting kids is fine, actually"". 💖",1671121012.0,throwRA_thissuckss,relationship_advice
"Is there a solution for a difference in libidos in a healthy relationship, 19M and 20F?","
Hi, my boyfriend and I are college students living together. We are together for a year and a half. Our relationship is amazing in almost every aspect. We communicate everything, we talk about how to love one another, we dont fight ever besides this problem that is leading us to a break up. We talked about getting therapy but it is extremly expensive for our budget. 

This problem started right after the honeymoon faze, we realised that i have a much lower libido than him. We think that he is maybe a sex addict, and i also have some trauma from the past relationships, so sex is a difficult topic to navigate. 

We talked about it a lot, we both understand the problem, we understand each other, but cant find  a solution ourselves.

Does anyone have this problem? (I read it is one of leading reasons for divorce) Is this even solvable or will we have to sacrifize this aspect of us, or break up?",1734104335.0,Acrobatic_Order_4306,relationship_advice
I 22M am feeling overwhelmed by my gf 23F getting upset very often. What can I do to set healthy boundaries for this relationship?,"I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for about 10 months, and I’m feeling emotionally drained by how often she gets upset or cries over things. I’ve tried to be supportive, but lately, it feels like no matter what I do, it’s never enough, and I’m starting to feel desensitized to her emotional reactions.

For example, leading up to her birthday, she was really anxious and upset about whether people would show up to her party. I tried to comfort her, but when I didn’t give the exact reassurance she wanted like telling her her friends would definitely show up, she got upset with me. Then, despite buying her presents, picking up pizza for the party, and buying some of the party supplies, surprising her with a happy birthday sign, she cried the next day because I didn’t get her flowers. She asked me why I don’t buy her flowers more often, even though I’ve given them to her four times already (I didn't actually remember the number of times I had given her flowers but she told me). Four times in 10 months seems like a good amount. I thought flowers were a nice occasional surprise, not a regular thing.

A couple of days after her birthday, she got upset again because at dinner with her family, they didn’t get her a second cake and candles. She had a party with me and friends, and there was cake and candles there, but she thought her family should have done the same. That night she went out and bought her own cake and candles, and then told everyone she did it herself. I honestly felt like it was over-the-top, but I kept my thoughts to myself.

This kind of thing happens a lot. She’ll cry for hours over something small like a slight change in plans, or being unable to find the right outfit which ""ruined"" our date night, then feels bad she was crying and upset for hours say things like, “I ruined the day” or “I’m a terrible girlfriend,” which is emotionally exhausting. I try to comfort her, but it feels like I’m stuck in an endless cycle. It’s hard to keep giving emotional support when it never feels like she can move past things. There’s also the fact that sometimes, when she’s upset, she’ll get up in the middle of the night and cry and hit things, which keeps me awake. I’m left physically and emotionally exhausted.

Another thing that’s draining is when she gets upset, sometimes she leaves the house without telling me where she’s going or when she is coming back.

Lately, I’ve stopped caring as much. I used to try to comfort her, but I just don’t have it in me anymore. I’m feeling desensitized, and I’m starting to feel like her emotional reactions are dramatic and out of proportion to the situation. I know I’m supposed to be supportive, but it’s honestly exhausting, and I feel like I’m losing myself in this dynamic.",1731970026.0,Cheap-Orange4406,relationship_advice
I still have feelings for my ex-wife,"
I (28M) used to be married to an amazing woman (24F). We divorced 2 years ago, and we were dating for 1 year, married for 3. She was & still is the love of my life and our divorce is my biggest regret.

My mother was a nightmare MIL. I stupidly let her involve herself in our marriage, & mistreat my ex wife by constantly criticizing her. I never called her to complain about my ex or sided with her against my ex wife, but I should have enforced strict boundaries with her as soon as I realized she was going to be a problem for us. I did go no contact with her twice, during my ex wife's miscarriages because I didn't want her to have added stress. However, during our 2nd miscarriage, my mother found out by reading some texts off my sister's phone and went ballistic (she found out it was the second one from the texts too). She turned up to our home, and instead of turning her away instantly, I took her into the living room and tried to explain things to her while my ex wife who was upstairs resting was unaware of her being there. My mother pretended to calm down, but when I went into our backyard to bring the cats inside, she went upstairs and woke my ex wife up. She screamed at her for 'ruining' my relationship with her and made some horrible comments about her being 'barren'. By the time I got upstairs (five minutes later because the cats were not very happy with me bringing them inside) my ex wife was in tears. I kicked my mother out immediately but that was my ex wife's final straw and we split up a month later and agreed to remain friends. We acknowledged that we still had feelings for eachother, but that this relationship wasn't beneficial to her anymore. We lived in the US, but my ex wife's dad lives in the UK so after our divorce, she went to go spend some time with him and ended up getting employed by one of his friends. 


I was devastated by the divorce, & I immediately went no contact with my mother and put myself into therapy. Therapy helped me understand that my relationship with my mother wasn't healthy, and I learned some good strategies to keep communication with her healthy so I'm now low contact with her. We only speak during family events. My siblings have told me that she still doesn't see what she's done wrong so I definitely won't be advancing beyond LC for the foreseeable future. 

I've not moved on from my divorce, and I think I'm even more in love with my ex than I have been before. I've not seen anyone new, and she's constantly on my mind.

During the first 6 months of my ex-wife living in the UK, we didn't speak. However, on our wedding anniversary she sent me a text that read 'Happy un-anniversary {insert a nickname that she used to call me}' followed by 'I thought we agreed to stay friends, loser'. For the rest of her 1st year away, we texted eachother every now and then, like on my birthday, her birthday & my brother's birthday. For my brother's birthday, she sent his to my house and I gave it to him for her. Before the MRA's get here, my brother is gay and they have been friends since they were children. He set us up on our first date so I don't want any crazy DMs. 

During her 2nd year away, we fell into a more typical friendship, and I told her about the therapy I had after she asked me if I had 'cut the umbilical cord yet '. She told me about two men that she had dated and about how both relationships ended. I wasn't weird about it, but it made me think about how much I missed her and how much I still loved her. My thoughts kept me up that night, and I couldn't stop hating myself for ruining things with her. I still have both of our wedding rings and her engagement ring. 

Due to recently world events, she hasn't been able to come visit anyone here in the US, but she's moving back in October. I was actually the first person she told about that. Everyone's pretty excited, and my brother is organizing a home-coming party for her and I've been invited. It's probably going to be hosted at my house (our marital home) because I'm the only person in our circle who lives alone. However, my brother asked me if I'd hanging out with her by myself at some point. I wasn't planning on asking her to, but now that he's brought it up it's all I can think of. They are best friends, so some part of me is thinking she might have put him up to it just like she did when she asked him to set us up together in the first place. I asked my sister for her input, but she said that I shouldn't ask her to meet up with me and I should wait for her to ask if wants to. I think she *might* still have feelings for me because when she was telling me about one of her breakups she said 'none of the men over here can handle me like you can' but her humour is generally flirtatious so I can't be sure.

I would love an outside perspective on this, would asking her out be the right thing to do? Thanks for reading.

Mini update 08/23: Y'all have convinced me to ask her now instead of waiting for October. It's late in the UK right now, but I will call her tomorrow! Thanks for all of the encouragement.

Edit 1: I wanted to clarify what I meant by LC since I know everyone has a different interpretation of it. The LC I have is only saying happy birthday to eachother in the family groupchat, we're never the first to say it to eachother and the conversation doesn't advance beyond that point. Whenever she comes up to me at family events which isn't often anymore, she usually asks how I am and for updates on my life. I give her one worded answers and gray-rock the rest. My therapist calls this method 'Civil NC' which I think is more accurate.

She freaked out about no contact when my ex wife first left, and regularly blew up my phone. LC has been more peaceful. I am aware this will change if my ex wife and I get back together and I'll be working with my therapist to create a plan for every possibility. I plan on returning to NC after the phonecall tomorrow, and I want to make it as safe and peaceful as possible so if a tiny bit of conversation is what it takes, I'll do it.

Edit 2: I'm logging off now because this is making me anxious (in a good way don't worry!). Next time y'all will hear from me is after our conversation 💪🏻💪🏻.

(cut the mini updates to shorten the post)

BIG UPDATE: 

I asked if she'd like to come out to dinner with me when she's back. SHE SAID YES!!!!! She actually asked me what took me so long to ask lmao. She said that if I hadn't asked her before the week before her return, then *she* would have asked *me* out so thank you guys SO MUCH for pushing me to call her. I feel like me making the first move is more meaningful as I was the one who ruined our marriage. I'm literally on cloud 11 right now. We're going to take it slow this time (we got engaged after six months the first time round lmao). I'M ALSO GOING TO BE PICKING HER UP FROM THE AIRPORT. Do I bring her flowers???? 

I also spoke to her about my mom. She was aware of the 'Civil NC' arrangement we had and she said she didn't mind if I kept it, but I don't want to and I made that clear. I only tolerate my mom's presence for my siblings and their children at events, but I am going to stop attending and celebrate important stuff with them at a different time. I'm hoping my nieces and nephews harass my siblings enough about me being missing from their birthday parties that my siblings un-invite my mom lmao, I *know* I'm their favorite uncle. I apologized to her immensely, and she said she'd hang up if I apologized anymore so I had to quit 😭. I know this is just the beginning, and more apologies will definitely follow once we start to discuss our failed marriage so I'm not trying to max out her apology-acceptance capacity. She's also agreed to start couples counseling with me once she gets back. We also discussed the possibility of, if we do get married again, us moving to the UK. She said that she wants to stay in the town I'm currently in for the next few years as she's missed her family and friends here a lot. Her maternal family is her, her paternal family is in the UK. *But* she said returning to the UK wasn't off the table completely, and I told her I'd follow her in a heartbeat. She called me a nerd lmao. Our conversation lasted two hours, and she had to go because she's taking her younger siblings out. She also said she had been asking my brother to hint to me that she wanted me back so I was right about what he was doing 🤬. I saw a comment earlier saying that I should've just asked my brother to spill it out properly and I wish I could convey how insanely annoying he is to y'all 😭 I'd have to hold him hostage to get him to say anything. 

I know we have so much more to discuss in the month before she returns and I'm making a priority list. Psycho mom is at the top. I told my ex I wanted to sell the house so my mom won't have my address, and I swear she wanted to reach through the screen and choke me 😭. She *loves* the house, and she said I can't list it anywhere or speak to a real estate agent before she has the chance to look around again and I'm happy to oblige my queen. I also saw some comments saying that I shouldn't send my mom that email (explaining my boundaries and consequences for her breaking them, idk if it was here or on r/JustNoMIL) and since my ex-wife doesn't want to leave this town for the near future, and given how small the town is, it's likely for my mother to run into us together and separately. I run into my mom atleast once a week and we ignore eachother. I would hope she would have the decency not to say anything, but she can't be trusted. I will be taking legal action if she does break our boundaries. Advice on this is appreciated!!! 

My current plan is to attempt total NC in the month before my ex-wife returns, there are four family birthdays coming up so it'll be perfect, my absence at all four events will definitely be noticed by her and I can see her reaction to it. I might also ask my brother and sister to sit her down and tell her not to bother me and that I've decided to go total NC but I'd like to know if that's a good idea. I know some of y'all are mad at 'Civil NC' but it's kept the peace I needed for the past two years however I know everything will be different when my ex wife is back. 


THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH, YOU'RE ALL INVITED TO OUR SECOND WEDDING.

Edit 3: SHE FOUND THIS POST OFF BESTREDDITOR UPDATES LMAO.  She called me a total nerd 😭. She wants me to thank y'all for convincing me to call her instead of waiting for October. And she told me to call her my girlfriend instead of ex-wife so that's what I'll be using from now on!

Edit 4: I won't be making an update post tomorrow! This sub only allows one update, and I'd rather save it for when my girlfriend is back :). Also I'm fully aware that my mom is a racist. By 'closet' racist, I meant someone who's kept it hidden effectively for so long. She's also just a fucking weirdo in general, so there's multiple reasons for why she doesn't like my girlfriend and my brother's boyfriend other than race. She hates my girlfriend because of her messed up family background and for the miscarriages in addition to race and she hates my brother's bf for being into motorbikes and smoking the green. She's incredibly absurd so at the beginning I wasn't sure if it was racism or not but now it's pretty obvious. My sister's boyfriend is also black (he's my girlfriend's cousin we set them up lmao) but he refuses to meet my mom because of how my girlfriend was treated. She's never commented on their relationship.

Edit 5 08/25: I doubt y'all are still lurking here but I thought I'd give a mini update. After spending some time on r/JustNoMIL and speaking with my therapist, I've decided the best course of action on re-establishing total NC is having a lawyer contact my mother. I've made contact with a good lawyer today, and we're going to begin drafting a letter to send to her. Some stuff I've seen on JNM have worried me, so I've also begun collecting evidence needed for a restraining order. I don't know how well old texts and videos will work but it's worth a shot. My girlfriend thinks I'm being too militant lmao, I think her time away has made her forget the worst of it, but she appreciates that I want to protect her.  Judging by some of the comments I think some of y'all have assumed that we're moving in together but we aren't. My mother does not know the address of where my girlfriend will be living.",1661259986.0,throwRAexhusband,relationship_advice
I (29M) don't know how to deal with my obese wife (31F),"The last couple years she has severely been letting herself go, I think it began soon after we were married. I don't know exactly how much she weighs but I'd guess the number begins with a 3. Possibly a 4. It's that bad.

She doesn't seem to care a single bit. 

I've tried everything. There's no way to force an adult to take care of themself so I thought I could at least tighten up my own act. I thought maybe she'd be influenced to start doing what I was. I started paying more attention to my diet by buying healthier foods. I took up an exercise routine and jogging (now I've grown to love this, it's keeping me sane during quarantine.) I didn't need to lose any weight, but I did tone up and feel like I have a lot more energy physically and mentally. When I mention this to my wife she just says that's nice. No interest or connection to herself.

I got more direct eventually by telling her I was worried about her health, but she didn't see why, because ""nothing is wrong"". Well, it is. But somehow she doesn't see it? Literally there's a mirror in our bedroom and the bathroom, and she doesn't realize. She's outgrown multiple clothing sizes. How do you not realize you've gotten THIS big? Being unhealthy doesn't have to look like a medical emergency like a heart attack. There's signs long before that happens and she ignores them. I pointed out how out of breath she gets going up or down stairs, and snoring at night, and bad hygiene, and she either had an excuse or said I was imagining things. She insists she's fine. She won't even walk anywhere except to get food and smells downright nauseating some days! 

Meanwhile every day she eats pretty much all the time, nonstop snacking punctuated by huge portions of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have even woken up to find her snacking in the kitchen in the middle of the night. On average she doesn't go more than an hour or two without eating something. All the snacks are junk food, the meals are either healthy things I cook for the both of us or fast food delivery. 

Since I'm now working remotely I've been able to see over the past couple weeks just how much she eats while I'm at work. This is her usual routine. She always said she didn't eat much during the day because she preferred to eat more at dinner once I was home. But that's not what I've seen. She goes out daily to the corner store for junk food and soda.

My problems are that she doesn't really clean up her trash and food that falls on the floor, the mess and sound of her eating is distracting while I'm trying to work unless I work in the bedroom, speaking of the bedroom it's getting hard to sleep comfortably because of how much space she takes up (sometimes I've been sleeping on the couch), also we obviously don't have sex, and I find myself being attracted to other women. I would never cheat, I just wish my wife was someone I could have a sexual relationship with. We used to, and it was great, before all this started.

Also the laziness and dismissive attitude, is something I really dislike. Does she simply not care? Is that all it is?? I keep thinking there's gotta be some REASON. It can't simply be this is just what she wants to be. No one WANTS to be this fat. I mean right?? And yes I've asked. She has a neverending supply of excuses and denials, but no explanation.

Lastly she has no sense of finances. I feel used sometimes because she'll spend money on whatever food she wants and the amount has steadily gone up over the years. She won't get a job because she thinks she's disabled (I don't believe this), but refuses to go to any doctor so therefore has no diagnosis to make her eligible for disability payments. I wish she had some form of income, I don't care what it is.

Also, what's finally pushing me to write this is her opinions have gotten more extreme the more weight she's gained. She's sometimes hateful towards people for no reason. For example she has made racist comments about how covid-19 is ""because Asians eat gross shit."" And refusing to be in the same vicinity as anyone Asian. That didn't stop her from ordering enough takeout for 3 people tonight from a Chinese place. I don't tolerate racism and I've shut this down when she starts saying it. Now I'm just wondering why can I not do the same thing with the obesity. 

What do I do about her? Is there any chance for getting through that she needs to stop all of this, and now, or do you think it's hopeless?

TL;DR: Don't know what to do about my wife refusing to lose weight and being lazy and other things.",1585364961.0,ThrowRAifeelstuck,relationship_advice
My current partner(29m) thinks it’s weird that me (27f) and the father of my child (29m) are on good terms,"So my ex and I share a toddler. My current partner thinks it’s weird that we talk on the phone to give updates about the kid and that I send him photos of fun things she does. My ex invited me and my partner to the beach, and my current partner thinks it’s weird and doesn’t want me to go. I grew up in a house where my parents were divorced but still friends and still did stuff together. It seems normal to me.

I(30f) just found out my husband’s(32m)been lying to his work about my pregnant sister(26f) being his wife. Can I even fix this?,"Throw away because I’m embarrassed and don’t want this on my main.

I’m really struggling right now and could use some advice from people who aren’t in my immediate circle because I’m too embarrassed to talk about it with anyone else.

I’m 30 and I’ve been married to my husband (32M) for five years. We’ve been together for seven and we met back in college. He was the first guy who made me feel comfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been more of a tomboy into sports preferring jeans over dresses and my body’s more on the athletic side. Growing up that wasn’t always easy. But my husband loved me for who I am and he never made me feel like I needed to change. I really thought I’d found the perfect partner.

I also have a younger sister Rosalie (26F) and we’ve always been close. She’s beautiful and effortlessly charming the kind of person everyone just loves. Our mom has some serious narcissistic tendencies and definitely played favorites growing up with Rosalie being the golden child. It wasn’t her fault and she never asked for the attention. In fact she’s always been super kind and supportive even though she’s the type who avoids confrontation and puts herself last to make others happy. So we’ve never really had any issues between us but all those comparisons growing up left me with insecurities I’ve never fully shaken.

About two months ago Rosalie’s long-term partner left her after finding out she was pregnant. She was devastated and we agreed she should move in with us for a while to get back on her feet. She’s been staying with us ever since and at first everything seemed fine. My husband didn’t seem to act any differently so I didn’t suspect anything was wrong.

One(?) month ago though I asked Rosalie to drop off something for my husband at work because I was swamped. I didn’t think much of it just that it would save me some time. Well she did and it turns out that when she got there everyone assumed she was his wife. They congratulated him on his “beautiful wife” and their “soon-to-be son” and instead of correcting them he just went along with it. He admitted that he liked how his coworkers reacted to having a beautiful wife and a baby on the way it made him feel good.

One of his coworkers asked him where his wife was at an event and since Rosalie had already dropped by once before they assumed she was his wife and he didn’t correct them. It made him feel validated like he was living up to some ideal that I guess I don’t fit into.

I didn’t find out about any of this until a few nights ago. We were out for dinner celebrating our anniversary when we ran into one of his coworkers at the restaurant. The guy asked my husband where his wife was and when my husband said something vague about her being busy I felt like the ground had just dropped out from under me. The date was basically ruined and we went home as soon was we ate. I confronted him as soon as we got home and that’s when he finally told me everything.

To say I’m devastated would be an understatement. My husband and I had always agreed on being child-free. We had that discussion early on in our relationship and I thought we were on the same page. I don’t have a strong desire to be a mom myself partly because I have PCOS and I know it would be difficult for me to conceive. But now it feels like my husband’s been using my sister to live out some fantasy life that I could never give him.

Rosalie had no idea about any of this. When I told her she was horrified. She kept apologizing even though none of this is her fault. She feels awful and has even offered to move out but I can’t ask her to do that. She’s already going through so much and I want to be there for her. But it’s so awkward now. I can see how guilty and uncomfortable she feels being in the middle of this mess.

This situation has also ripped open old wounds I thought I’d healed. I spent most of my 20s in therapy working on my self-esteem and trying to overcome these insecurities especially the ones tied to growing up in Rosalie’s shadow. I thought I’d finally come to a place where I could love myself for who I am. But now it feels like all that progress has been undone. Years of therapy feel wasted and I’m back to square one questioning my worth and my place in my husband’s life.

Since finding out things have been incredibly strained at home. My husband and I aren’t even sleeping in the same bed and we’ve barely spoken to each other. The trust we once had feels shattered and I have no idea how to even start repairing it. I feel so betrayed. If he can lie about something like this what else is he hiding? Did he think I wasn’t good enough to be introduced to his colleagues? And why has he never talked about his work friends before? I’m starting to wonder if he’s been hiding me because he’s embarrassed by who I am.

This whole thing has dragged up every insecurity I’ve ever had. I’ve always felt like I didn’t measure up to Rosalie even though she’s never done anything to make me feel that way. But now it feels like my husband has confirmed my worst fears he chose to pretend Rosalie was his wife because she fits some ideal image and I don’t.

I honestly don’t know how to move forward from this. I love my husband and I want to believe this was just a huge mistake but it feels like so much more than that. I’m also worried about how this is affecting Rosalie. She’s been nothing but supportive but I can see how uncomfortable and guilty she feels being in the middle of this.

 I’m really struggling here. How do I even begin to address this with my husband without it turning into a huge fight again? I feel so low but I can’t stand the idea of our relationship ending. I love this man more than anything. He keeps saying sorry and trying to plan date nights. I’m honestly not in the mood for any of it. I’ve cried two times and have binge ate more than I have ever before. How do I live my life now knowing that I’m possibly not enough for my husband??

UPDATE: Future MIL (54F) called me (23F) stupid and now I’m considering calling off the wedding. How do I approach the situation?,"First of all, I wanted to say thank you to people who reached out to answer my questions about black holes, snails, ducks, light bulbs and other stuff. I would love to have you as my friends. 

For the other people who said I should just shut up - I don’t really care if you find me annoying or hard to be around. I’m okay with that. I don’t exist to please everyone. I’m just here for a good time, have my own interests and learn. 

I didn’t expect my post to gain so much attention but I’m so grateful for the advice. Most of you told me to break up with him and at the very least confront him, so that’s what I decided to do. You gave me a push and confidence to do it. 

But before I did that, I texted the wife of John’s brother, the one who said she liked me asking questions. I asked if we can meet up for coffee. She said sure.

We met and I didn’t see the point in pretending to her that I didn’t hear their conversation. So after some small talk I just said „I heard you all talking about me during the bbq”. She immediately got sad and said she feels embarrassed. She explained that it wasn’t a joke, wasn’t out of context, that it was just mean and hurtful. She said she’s sorry for not defending me more, but I said that’s it’s okay and I understand. I told her that I don’t blame her for anything, and just wanted to make sure that I understand the situation and see it for what it really was.. And it really was laughing about me behind my back. Just bullying. 

At this point I just had to confront John. In my last post so many comments were saying that he will probably try gaslighting me. And you were right. 

We were having dinner together for the first time since the bbq happened, because before I tried my best to avoid him. (Yes, I know, not very mature of me, but other than you guys I don’t really have a strong support system. My family and best friends are hundreds of kilometers away. I only have two good friends here) I was so stressed I thought I’m going to pass out. My legs were shaking and I was terrified because I knew deep down that this is the moment when my five year relationship goes down the drain. 

I looked him in the eyes and asked „How does the sun work?”. He looked confused, so I followed with „Where should I put my fork? Why does nobody like me?” At this point realization hit him and he started nervously laughing. I said I was there and I heard them. After the initial shock passed, he got mad. He said its rude to eavesdrop. I said it’s rude to bully people. 

He tried telling me that it was just a joke. That I shouldn’t be so uptight. That it really was funny. 
I said that I didn’t find it funny and went to the guest  to calm down. He started panicking. He was asking me to please talk to him. He was much more apologetic and said that he will be 100% honest with me. I asked if his mother made similar comments before the bbq. He said yes. I asked him if he ever defended me. He said he tries to. I don’t know if I believe him. He told me he loves me and respects me. I don’t know if I believe it either.

I said that I love him too, but I need a break. He’s all I ever known. He was my first and only partner. I have no outside perspective of this, I have no experience. I need a moment to think. I will be going to my friends house for a while to think everything through. The apartment has his name on the lease anyway.

After I gathered some of my things and left, he kept texting me non stop. He tried calling but I didn’t respond. I was very hurt because he tried to belittle my feelings and only later when he realised that I might break up with him, started apologising. 

The next day I decided to give him another chance to explain himself and I came back to the apartment. He seemed very sad and tired. He said that he told his mother that I overheard them. I said I don’t care. It’s his time to step up and show me that he cares, I’m not interested in a apology from his mother. I’m already done with her. I can’t put up with this behaviour and mocking me like we’re in primary school. 

I saw a comment saying that probably her ego is hurting. I think it’s true. She never got the chance or never had desire to have an education. She is a very good home maker but outside of that she doesn’t have many interests of her own. If I’m asking her about making tomato soup she will be talking for 30 minutes lecturing me about adding enough sugar, but not too much. She will lecture anyone who is willing to listen. But anytime someone is talking about something she’s not familiar with - she gets defensive and try to imply that nobody cares about that and if its not relevant to her, it shouldn’t be discussed. 

Once again he tried telling me that I should relax because it was only a joke and at this point I had enough. I took of my ring and told him that his behaviour is a joke and I can’t be the punch line. I told him that I wish him and his family the best and to look in the mirror to check if they really are as superior as they think they are. I said I’m going to be back with my friend soon to pick up the rest of my stuff and to not contact me again unless it’s about moving my things out. 

And that’s it. I’m done. Thank you all for the advice. Without you I wouldn’t have the confidence to leave this man. I know I deserve better. I can’t be with someone who can’t stand up for me, and I wouldn’t be able to feel comfortable around his family, so I’m done with the relationship. I hope they will treat his next girlfriend better.

I think my (28F) partner (30M) of 10 years might have abandoned me and our baby?,"I don’t even really know what to say. Thank you in advance to whoever reads this. I don’t know what to think or do anymore, I feel completely heartbroken and confused and really need some advice and empathy. 

To start, my fiancé wanted a family. We bought a house together a few years ago, but only his name went on the title because most of the downpayment came from his RRSP. This made me a bit uncomfortable but we were planning to get married after saving a bit more so i agreed. I paid all our moving costs and furnished the entire house, so we both spent about the same. 

We had our daughter last November, a planned child he claimed to have wanted. When I was pregnant, he suddenly started gambling, something he’d never done before. He gambled away a few of his paycheques and finally after a month I managed to get him to agree to give me control of his account. 

I give birth. When I’m 4 weeks postpartum, he claims to get the flu and spends an entire month at his parents house to avoid infecting the baby. I thought he’d be there for a few days at most. 

He returns. In March, he claims there’s a giant work project that he needs to throw his all into. He works from home and since I was on an unpaid mat leave (self employed) he was the breadwinner. 

He stops speaking to me, claiming he’s so busy with work and he’s so stressed that he doesn’t even have time to say hi to me in the morning. However, he’s awake all night and sleeping in during the day. Around the same time, HR calls me and says he hasn’t logged on in a few days and they send a wellness check. 

Eventually, after a month and a half of not speaking to me, eating alone in his room, ignoring the baby completely, he demands his bank account back. I have no choice but to give him his card but I was hoping he wouldn’t lock me out of the account. He does. He then gambles again. 

I decide to go down to my parents house for a few days after he rages out at me when I try to talk to him. He basically stops responding to my texts except to tell me to fuck off and that he’s depressed. 

He responds some of the time, saying he’s trying to get therapy and saying I can’t come back home until he talks to a therapist. This entire time I am stressed knowing he’s probably gambling and not paying the mortgage or bills. 

This continues through June, July, August. He refuses to speak with me, I plead and beg him to talk to me. Finally in September he tells me he’s behind on the mortgage and needs money. I send him the money. He thanked me at first and says I’ll be able to come home soon - at this point he would barely let me in the house to get mine or our baby’s things, screaming and freaking out the few times I showed up. 

He stops speaking to me again, only responding to tell me to fuck off and stop contacting him. At certain points he tells me he loves me and wants me and the baby to come home soon, but he needed to get through therapy first. 

This brings me to the present. Just before our daughter’s first birthday, he blocked my number and blocked me on Facebook. I have been begging and pleading with him to tell me what’s going on, to tell me SOMETHING and nothing. 

We have four cats that he wouldn’t let me come and get. I own all the furniture and so many belongings in the house and I have no idea if the mortgage company is going to just repo and trash it all. I have no idea if my beloved cats are okay. I don’t even know if we are together anymore. 

I have tried to get his parents to talk to him, they’re in contact with him and gave him money for the mortgage back payments. They just say they don’t know and that he won’t talk to them about this. 

I was at my parents house and now I’m staying in my brothers basement. I feel like I’ve lost everything. I don’t know what happened. 

————————
EDIT: 

Thank you so much for all of the kind comments. I have felt so alone and just getting this out helped a lot. I have been so depressed over this situation that I feel like I can barely breathe most days. 

I think I’ve been in denial, like this CANT be actually happening to me and that one day I’m going to wake up to his heartfelt apology and all the bills fixed and go back to my beautiful house. 

It was our dream home and we got it for such a deal. Beautiful historic home, six bedrooms, original features, huge yard with amazing 100 year old trees all through the neighborhood. It was the neighborhood I grew up dreaming about living in someday. 

To know I’ll never be able to afford a house on my own and that I have no idea where my daughter will grow up…. It is just killing me. I grew up so poor and thought I had finally made it and would be able to give my baby a good life. 

To just be blocked with no answers.. for him to be losing the house and not even give me a chance to take it over for our daughters sake. He doesn’t even know where I’m living right now. I slept on the floor for two months when this first started. 

I thought we were soulmates.

"My (26F) Husband's (26M) family keeps referring to me as his ""best friend"". What does this mean?","My Husband Robbie (26 M) and I (26 F) got married earlier this year. It was a beautiful day and I felt so much love and support from both sides of our family. 

Two months after our wedding day, we celebrated my birthday at my inlaws house. It was nothing major, just a dinner and a night together with me, my husband, his mom (50sF) , dad (50sM), and sister(22F). That is the first night I noticed them referring to me as ""Robbie's best friend"". 
After my birthday dinner, we were all sitting together in the livingroom, just chatting and having some drinks. That's when my SIL got a phone call from a good friend of hers. When she answered the phone and her friend asked what she was doing, she replied that it was her ""brother's best friend's birthday"". I had never heard anyone refer to me as Robbie's best friend. I am his wife, and before that we were engaged for over 2 years. Hearing my SIL refer to me like that confused me greatly. I always refer to her as my SIL, and I would expect her to do the same. Or maybe even as Robbie's wife, but certainly not best friend. After my SIL hung up her phone, I asked her why she referred to me the way she did. She did not seem at all abashed. She just said ""well, you are best friends! And that's what mom and dad call you"" (referring to MIL and FIL). 
My SIL and I are by no means very close, but we are nice to each other and have never had any fights. We just don't hang out outside of family functions because our personalities are pretty different. She's never made it seem like she was annoyed or mad at me. 

I decided to let it go that night, even though it weirded me out. But then it all happened again a few days ago, which is why I'm writing this post. My MIL and I both work in the same industry doing similar jobs, but at different companies in the area. Sometimes our companies collaborate when we have clients who switch over. This week we had that happen, and I had to pay a visit to my MILs office to help a client transition. My MIL was in the office, so I stopped by to say hello. While I was there she introduced me to her colleague, and once again I was perplexed by how she did it. She said, ""this is my son's best friend!"" As I was shaking hands with the colleague. I paused and awkwardly said ""I'm his wife..."". The colleague looked confused but my MIL continued to smile and didn't address it. 
Once we were alone I asked my MIL why she referred to me like that. Just like my SIL she didn't seem to act like it was weird at all, and said the same thing, ""well you are best friends!"". 

The only thing that I can think to explain this is that in my vows to Robbie I promised to continue being his best friend. Nobody acted like this was odd or special, and I feel like it's a pretty common thing to put in vows. So I'm not sure why Robbie's family seems to have clung to it, unless it has nothing to do with everything. I've spoken to Robbie about this too, and he is also perplexed by it. He asked his parents privately about it and they gave him the same answer they've been giving me. 

It all just feels like some sort of bullying behavior to me, but I've never felt a sense of this from them before. Are they calling be his best friend because they don't like the fact I'm his wife? Or is it some inside joke they've been in on without me? I'm not sure what to do or make of it, especially because the in laws are acting like it's not an issue when I bring it up. Yes, I am Robbie's best friend, but I'm also his life partner, and their DIL/SIL. I don't know what to do. Any input or advice would be welcome. 

TLDR; my inlaws keep referring to me as my husband's ""best friend"", but I am his wife and their daughter in law. They don't seem to think it's weird at all.

My boyfriend 39M told me 24F that I have a wide vagina?,"I’m not sure if I should be concerned about this? I would have obviously raised concerns about his comment when it came up but he assured me that he did not mean it in a bad way. 
He has actually told me this a few times. He said once that my cooch is made for “bigger d*cks”.  The last time we had sex, he said it felt “surprisingly tight” as he does not always feel my vaginal walls during sex.
I want to believe that he doesn’t mean it in a bad way but… I’m not sure what’s good about having a wide cooch? Sometimes it lowkey feels like he’s trying to tell me that I’m loose because well, I don’t believe there is a difference between a wide and loose cooch.
I’ve not had many sexual partners in the past (only 2) and I have never heard that comment from either of them before so I’m really not sure what to believe here. It’s taking a small toll on my self confidence as I am trying very hard not to let that define me.

My (32F) husband (34M) has always been a big eater. He's a big gym-goer so him consuming an upwards of 9-10k calories a day has always been his norm. His parents even said it nearly bankrupted their family trying to feed him through puberty. He's still very lean.

It's never caused issues until I started residency. 

We share groceries, and on my days off we try and get out to the grocery store together for a big grocery run. Unfortunately, due to a hospitalization as a child caused by a major food handling issue in my school (me and almost 100 other students were hospitalized) I am working through strong aversions to ""unsafe"" foods. I'm working with a psychiatrist about it (and have been since I was a child) and have my ""safe"" foods (which are generally dry pantry goods or very specific items otherwise).

We buy huge quantities, our grocery bill works out to be about $1k/month (we don't have kids). 

Recently, all of this food has been disappearing within 5-6 days. He drinks about a gallon of milk a day, half a box of cereal, an entire package of chicken, multiple large tubs of yogourt and entire blocks of cheese- this doesn't even include his midnight snacks. This is one day. I can sometimes get in a bite or two of the food I bought before I find the empty packages in the pantry the next day. It's almost insult to injury that he puts the empty packages back instead of in the garbage. 

It's not uncommon I come home to an empty fridge- most days I'm too exhausted coming home to even bother ordering takeout- I've fallen asleep too many times on the couch just to wake up the next day with the food untouched on the front door mat. My only saving grace is that my residency program pays for meals while we're on shift so at least I get 2/3 meals a day at the hospital- that is, if I have a chance to eat on shift. 

I begged my husband to get seen by a doctor (I was concerned about a thyroid issue, an eating disorder, or even insane diagnoses like Prader-Willi) and he dragged his feet before inevitably going. Nothing awry with his labwork by any means which totally stunned me. He hasn't gained any weight. He isn't binging and purging (at least from what he's told me) and he doesn't display any signs that he would be purging. I asked if he felt upset or stressed with my long work hours (I work around 80 hours a week) and he said he was coping fine. 

The biggest issue I'm facing is that I'm constantly coming home to an empty fridge/cabinet. The best I can do is ketchup with salt and pepper because of how efficiently he clears out any food item. He has tried to cook for me in the past but gets fidgetey waiting for me to come home (the most recent example I have is him preparing two lage pans of lasagna- he ate it all in one sitting before I even got home). 

Even groceries I explicitly bought for myself and my husband knows are my safe foods get eaten because he ""forgot"" or ""thought I wouldn't eat them anyways."" He does have severe ADHD he is getting medicated  so the forgetfulness I can sometimes forgive but I have even started designating specific shelves/drawers to be mine or putting up signs on food I want to be saved- it doesn't stop him. I just want to be able to have a snack when I get home without wondering if the cabinet will be empty. 

My next step was to look at putting a fridge in our basement with a lock so I have my own safe stash of food but I shouldn't have to go down that extreme. I seriously wonder if a locked fridge would even deter him.

I'm at a total impasse of what to do now. I've asked my colleagues both for medical and personal advice and they've expressed concerns that he's doing this maliciously if we can't find a reason otherwise. He's been the light of my life and is a fantastic partner in so many ways outside of the food situation so I'm at a loss. But coming home today to find the one bag of veggie straws I asked him to save for me gone just broke me. ",1728102273.0,ThrowRA_OddSundae39,relationship_advice
"I (M37) can often smell my girlfriend's (F35) butt during sex in doggy. It's been raised, but the situation remains the same. What am I to make of this?","My girlfriend and I have been together for over a decade, but this has always been a problem. If we have sex and I'm behind her, then I can smell her ass. It basically smells like she's been to the toilet at some point and hasn't cleaned herself very well. There's nothing to see, it's just the smell. But it's unmissable and present without my face being anywhere near there. It's rare that this isn't the case.  When it happens it takes me completely out of the moment. It actively upsets me to be honest, but I play it down generally. Because I love her, I don't want to upset her, and I do want a sexual connection with her.

That much said, the matter has been raised. On some of these occasions she's noticed something's up, or I've simply managed to sensitively raise it. Her response has always been good - a little embarrassment (naturally) but acceptance and willingness to go and clean herself to some degree there and then. But in the long term the issue just doesn't change. It's like she doesn't gather that, even though this has come up multiple times, there's a trend here.

She doesn't have generally bad personal hygiene. Other parts of her body don't smell and she's not generally stinky or anything. However, she's not a daily shower person and I'm sure that has at least something to do with the issue. She showers every 2/3 days. I can only imagine that she's not cleaning herself well in between. I shower daily and I'm quite conscious of my own personal hygiene.

At this stage I'm really just unsure what to either make of it or what to do about it. We've both had numerous previous partners, presumably none of her prior sexual partners have ever raised it?  Is this *my* problem? I've never experienced this with any other women, but is it actually quite *normal*? If not, then how do I even approach this now, at this stage?  When we first got together I expressed some discomfort at her ""only"" showering every few days, and that didn't go down well. I have no idea how to speak to her about how she needs to do better job of cleaning her butt as part of her everyday hygiene routine.",1714255124.0,ThrowRAShotLion92,relationship_advice
I know this is a redflag but.. how red? My (34f) husband (37m) knowingly did something that would cause my medical condition to flare up,"I have suffered from eczema for about 10 years. In the past I have had anywhere from mild to moderately-severe flare ups, but in the past year I have FINALLY gotten it under control to the point I actually don’t have hardly any flare ups anymore! Part of the solution to my eczema that I found was turning off our water softener. I know that is not the case for everyone and some people say that soft water is actually better for eczema, but that is not the case with my skin. In fact, I experimented with it multiple times and proved that it did in fact cause flare ups for me. 

Cut to approximately 6 mo ago. I started noticing the itchiness increasing and a few small flare ups. I checked the water softener and lo and behold it was turned on again. I asked my husband about it and he had some reasoning or another, that he preferred the soft water, and joked that he wanted to see if it was just in my head. I was very angry and we got in a fight about it. I told him that this obviously is not in my head as I had the flare ups and itchiness to prove it. I told him to please never turn it on again and he apologized and agreed. I cannot for the life of me remember if we unplugged the machine or just turned it off. 

Cut to yesterday. Got out of the shower and felt the slimy/itchy feeling that comes with soft water. Immediately went and looked at the water softener and it was plugged in and on. I was absolutely irate and also heartbroken. I immediately confronted him, but he completely denies turning it on. We do not live with anyone else, no kids or roommates or anything. We did have a guy inspecting gas lines recently in our basement which is in the same room as the water softener. His dad also is at our house from time to time and is very much a nosy busybody type who also has slight dementia. I would not be completely shocked if his dad messed with it as he has a history of similar things. So there is a small small chance that one of those people actually did plug it in or mess with it. But.. my gut is honestly that he’s lying to me and that he did this again. But I also can’t wrap my head around the fact that he would knowingly do something that would cause me physical discomfort and pain. I want to believe him but I think there is probably a 75% chance it was him.

What I have done so far: I unplugged the machine, and put a note on the cord saying ‘do not plug in’. I explained to him very clearly that it is not funny, it’s not ok to ‘test’ me like that, and that it causes me lots of discomfort. I explained all of this and told him very plainly that if it is ever plugged in again that I would be filing for divorce as he would knowingly be putting my health and comfort at risk. 

My question is… I know this is a red flag, and I will 100% be on alert for other signs. But… how red are we talking? Does this count as like emotional or even physical abuse? Or is it just a little squall or misunderstanding between two people who prefer different things? Like I said, I know it’s not ok. I just want to know how bad this is. Anyone’s helpful opinions appreciated! Or any advice for anything else I should do at this point. Thank you in advance  


For added context, our relationship otherwise is good, not perfect but mostly good. He is what I would consider a good person for the most part, although he is not a perfect partner. But no history of mental or physical abuse. The worst of it from his side is disrespect at times and being selfish or inconsiderate. All things that lots of partners struggle with. Just added that for context  ",1730056863.0,123wollywolly,relationship_advice
Boyfriend 32M of 2 years wants me 23F to be “normal” How do I proceed?,"So I 23F have been dating my boyfriend 32M for almost two years, but there are several issues that are really bothering me. I’ve never met any of his friends or family; he’s never introduced me to anyone important in his life. He’s very passionate about politics, race, and social justice, which I don’t mind. He’s financially successful and travels frequently with friends, but he never invites me along.

In March, he went on a month-long trip to Bali and the Philippines with a friend, and that friend’s girlfriend joined them later. After he came back, I discovered I had contracted chlamydia. When I told him, he denied cheating and dismissed my feelings, saying it was easily curable and that I was overreacting, even though I’ve been SA’d by a previous partner. We talked about it, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Over the past year, he’s started telling me what I should eat based on advice from naturopathic doctors and has begun extreme intermittent fasting. He tries to impose these changes on me and gets upset if I don’t follow his advice. I’ve only told him I love him once after six months, and he shut me down.

I recently moved closer to work, and he helped me move. After settling in, he came over but criticized my apartment, complaining about the cleanliness and the quality of my belongings. He also compared me to serial killers, saying I was “weird” for having stuffed animals. He claims he has the right to express his feelings and wants a “normal” girl with a good job. He often makes hurtful comments and accuses me of thinking mean things about him.

I’m now seriously considering ending the relationship, but this is my first major relationship outside of high school. I still care about him, but he makes me feel like trash. I struggle with depression and low self-esteem and am unsure about how to proceed.

I’d appreciate any advice on what my next steps should be and how to handle this situation.

Update: On Friday I had my best friend over and she was with me when I sent the text message. He never responded and has remained silent. I thought I would feel more sad or upset but I just don’t feel anything anymore. It’s nice to be able to breathe. He lives a block from the upscale grocery store I work at so I’ll more than likely see him in the future. If anything happens I’ll update again.",1724784011.0,DazzleDragon,relationship_advice
"My (22F) husband (30M) wants to implement ""rewards and punishments"" to help me balance my life and improve myself. But, I think it's not good for our relationship. How do I make him see that it's not good, and what alternatives can I suggest?","Good morning. I'm sorry that the title reads as ""why don't you just say no or stop"". I just wanted to clarify and say that we have something called ""two month policy"" between us. That means that if one of us suggest something that we think will be good for us and beneficial, we have to try it at least for two months. For example, one thing I suggested before was working out together and going for a run because I thought we've been out of shape for long and being more fit will help us do more fun things together. And, I wanted to stop or slack off, but the two month policy saved it and made me keep going.

So... The ""rewards and punishments"" are something my husband suggested. I started my first job out of college a few months ago, and that was after all the wedding and honeymoon stuff. So, I had been really tired, stressed, and overwhelmed in the last few months. And, it had been hard for me to balance things both at work and home.

So, I kept making promises to myself that I'll do one thing (like working out, cleaning, reading, etc.) and end up not doing it. Or, I spend too much energy at work because I'm not used to compartmentalized work stuff and personal life internally, so I get home stressed and tired, so I haven't been able to focus on our relationship as much or just be a good partner in general.

Since I keep trying to improve that but keeps not doing things to actually do that, my husband said that he thinks that having incentives and consequences will make me actually follow through. And, he said that he really thinks this will help me, and it will be our next thing to try for the next two months, and I should decide if I want to keep doing it or not.

So basically, he set some goals and things I should do for me, and if I do them, I get rewards, and if I don't I punished.

I could be OK with that, but the rewards and punishments kind of make me feel small and kind of dehumanized. Like rewards include more screen time, snacks, things I like in bed, etc. And, he wants to punish me by like spanking, taking my phone away, making me stand in the corner, or things I don't really like in bed. I tried to say that those are kind of weird and that those will make me feel small and not like a grown independent person, then he said that it won't work unless the rewards are straightforward and I want to avoid the punishments.

So, we've been doing that for a couple weeks, but I do not like it. And, I feel silly and dumb trying to negotiate rewards and punishments. And I don't think it's good for our relationship because it's making me feel like we are not equal and he's trying to be some kind of ""father figure"" not a husband. And I already have some insecurities with feeling like a grown up woman and confidence (mainly because of my figures and height. I'm pretty small), but I know I've been technically doing ""better"", but I think it's not helping me feel like a grown woman.

I tried to talk to him about this and maybe make it stop, and he brings up the two month policy and tells me I should trust him and give this a try fully before I say no because it only has been two weeks. And he tells me times that he went through even though he didn't like it by trusting me like the time I made him quit red meat completely. He quit for two months, and he said he didn't feel any differences in health, so he start eating them again but in moderation. And, he's telling me that I should try it at least two months and decide.

But, I feel like I already feel like it's not good, and want it to stop. But, maybe I should just push through it for the next two months and say no to be fair and keep up with the policy we set for each other? How do I make him see this, and what are some alternatives that I can suggest to make him feel like I'm still trying and to make compromises?

Thank you for your advice..

Update: I'm sorry that this is not much of an update (also, I'm sorry for apologizing again. I know I shouldn't too much). But, I still wanted to give an update since so many people were concerned about me and gave me really good advice.

I am a bit overwhelmed by the amount of the comments and advice I got, but I'm trying my best to read from the oldest to new, so it's taking awhile to get through them all, but I am reading them all...

I'm sorry that it's taking awhile and I haven't made an update for days since I made a post, but it has been hard to do so because I'm at work during the day and around my husband after work...

But, I now know that this is more serious than I thought and is not normal... I know that, but it's still overwhelming and confusing, especially it's all new information and I love him, and I'm trying hard to come up with a way reading all the advice you've given me and looking up the resources.... I'm sorry that I don't have a clear course of action to give an update, but I'm working on it..

Also, I answered some of the comments, but I wanted to answer some questions that were asked a lot.
- How old was I when we started dating?: I was 19~20.
- Was he my first boyfriend?: Yes.
- Who came up with the 2 month policy?: He brought that up, but I was the one to say let's try it after he told me about it.
- Does he have rewards and punishments too?: No, he doesn't.

I (28m) ran into my ex wife's sister (24f) at the store. After catching up she asked me on a date. I have mixed feelings. What should I do? ,"TLDR: I'm a 28(m), I recently ran into my ex-wife's sister Riley (24f) at the grocery store, and after talking with her and sort of ""catching up,"" she ended up asking me out on a date, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

Quick background, my ex wife is the same age as me, and I have not seen her since we divorced three years ago. There was nothing juicy about the divorce, just two kids who got married too young, too soon, and realized it too late. We divorced pretty amicably and she ended up moving away. I did as well for a time, but I ended up coming back home last year, I had no idea what my ex was doing and didn't really care. I got along with her family until the end, although I did not know her sister that well since either we were in college or she was in college (away from us), but I obviously had met her several times and had a cordial relationship with her - never felt any weird vibes while married to her sister.  My ex was not really close with her sister but they also did not have any ill will toward each other.

Anyway, she told me that my ex is engaged and happy, which I was actually happy to hear. She said her parents are doing well and they even asked her a little while ago if she knew what I was doing, which she didn't because I don't keep in contact with anyone from her family (kind of wanted a clean break, you know?). We (me and ex) do have some mutual friends but I don't think Riley really knows them that well. It was a nice conversation.

Before we finished talking Riley asked me if I would like to have a drink with her sometime. I thought maybe she just wanted to catch up in a better setting (more so than two people leaning on shopping carts), but then she said ""But I understand if you don't want to go on a date with your ex wife's sister."" So it's a date... I did end up exchanging numbers with her, asking her kind of lightly how her parents would feel and got a ""they would probably be happy that I found someone they liked."" I figured I would rather have the number and not use it than wonder if I should have gotten it...I don't know. I guess I was also just happy that an attractive woman asked me for my number. She did mention in our conversation, before she asked me out, that she was always surprised that her sister let such a good guy go, which I corrected her and told her it was definitely mutual, not all on my ex.

Riley is very pretty, I enjoyed talking to her, and I like her family (they also always liked me). If I had just run into her as a stranger and there was no history, if I'm being honest it would have made my day to have been asked that. But I keep thinking that it's weird, like, she's obviously a grown woman now but she was a teenager when I started dating my ex wife (as I said I didn't see her all that much so no, this is not a grooming situation), I would feel weird going to her parents, almost being like ""hey, I decided to give your other daughter a try!"", then how would my ex feel about it? Would it ruin her relationship with her sister? And if we got serious, I'd have to see my ex wife at functions, which I don't care that much about but it's still odd, you know? Then I got these intrusive thoughts like - is this my unconscious trying to make my failed marriage seem like a success? Then there's like -what if Riley had the same tendencies that made you and ex incompatible? But I feel like I'm also not being fair to Riley.

Riley has a great family, she seems to have her stuff together, she was enjoyable to talk to. I feel like I could be allowing my past to throw away a potentially great partner...I don't know, I'm really confused. Help me!

EDIT 1: I can't post an official update yet so here's the best I can do. I have read through your comments, taking my lashings from some, gotten some weird, creepy personal messages from others who as one person put it, understood why I wanted to ""knock boots"" with my ex's sister. In fact, it was the creepy ""pro"" messages that actually changed my mind more than the people telling me not to go on the date (though some of you against it also made some great points).

I texted Riley and told her that I don't think it is appropriate for us to go on a date. I told her that I enjoyed talking to her and catching up but that we should only be cordial if we see each other out but nothing more. Maybe I shouldn't have said this but I also told her that it is nothing personal against her, that she seems like a really great person, but given my history with her sister it just isn't appropriate. She replied that she understood and respected my decision, but also said that she didn't think my ex wife would have a problem with it, but I was steadfast and said I still don't think it's appropriate.

I also learned a lot about myself here, and if you read some of my comments you might have seen this but I'll try to summarize:

I miss being a husband. I miss being in a loving marriage. I don't miss my ex wife, but I miss what we once had and I want that again (with someone else). I didn't know I felt that way, at least consciously, until I spoke to Riley. I think her being my ex wife's sister brought out some feelings in me that were never unlocked by the women I went on dates with in the interim because they were detached enough from my previous marriage that I could still repress those feelings. I didn't realize how lonely I was and how much I craved having a woman that I could come home to and not just receive love, but give it. I think I focused so much on my career and other things in my life that I buried those feelings after my divorce.

Finally - call me dumb, naive, oblivious, emotionally unintelligent, etc. - but I'm not a bad person and I never intended to destroy anyone's relationships. I also was not thinking about sex (thinking with my d\*ck), if you see some of my replies, I didn't even think of some of the conundrums there. I was thinking with a heart that confused scar tissue with being healed. As for Riley, I don't know what her intentions were, and at this point I don't care. I am not going on that date with her, I'm going to talk to a professional about my unresolved love issues, and I want to thank everyone here for opening up my eyes, even if you were a jerk - except the person who basically accused me of being a p\*do - you can fuck off.

EDIT 2: I'm going to bed. I have been up WAY too late with this (and drank too many beers, more than a long time). I have tried to respond as best I can. People who didn't even read the whole thing, I don't care about your opinion. People who did and offered up stuff, even if I didn't like, thanks for your input. This thing has blown up so much I'll give you all an update if anything else of note transpires.",1724093486.0,ThrowRA4111,relationship_advice
My 29M gf 28F wants a one time free pass incase the opportunity arises. Any female perspective to help me understand ? ,"


My 29M girlfriend 28F wants a one time free pass in case the opportunity presents itself.
We know each other since 15 years dating since 5 years. So I know her quite well. I know she isn’t into one night stands and she has never had any. Besides our relationship she’s been in another longterm relationship and had one more sexual partner. 
We’re monogamous. Never had any trust issues and an open relationship has never been a topic. 
Now. 
She was doing a 3 weeks surf camp holiday. Came back and wants to do an even longer 3 months long travel trip / surf camp. We’re moving to a new flat which we already signed the lease in 1.5 months and she wants to go travel in 3 months. 
Since she’s in between jobs and has the money its a good time and probably last time to do that for the foreseeable future. I’m fine with her going but she said since she’s always putting herself behind (which she does) she wants for once have total freedom and being able to make her own decision which includes 100% freedom. Which also means having the option to get a free pass with somebody else if the opportunity presents itself. She says she doesn’t want to just go and do it and probably won’t. But having the option is important to her since it means total freedom. And she wants to have it one time before we get kids or get on more in life and she’ll regret not being able to have complete freedom for once.
On her 3 weeks trip she said she didn’t do anything but said there was a situation which she thought she would probably would have gotten intimate with somebody if she would have been single. 
I don’t know what to do or think. I don’t really understand her perspective since she’s the one pushing for us moving together to a bigger place, getting kids eventually and so. She says she missed me and wants to get old with me but she needs the total freedom just once.
She’s ready to put the relationship on the line if I don’t accept it or grant it. She realizes its crazy but it’s just the way she feels. She wants to put herself first for once and feel free before she regrets it later in life. 
I would get a free pass as well but she doesn’t wanna know if it happens.
I’m more then confused and overwhelmed by the situation. Can any female understand her way of thinking and explain it ? I hope I was able to summarize it understandably any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. 

TLDR: GF wants option to have a one time free pass incase the opportunity arises on her travel. 



EDIT:

I get a free pass as well. 

It’s not a 3 months pass it’s a one time pass. 

Her response to my pass was she would be heartbroken if I used the pass but she has to live with the consequences of her actions. 

It’s unlikely but not impossible she meets the guy again since she wants to go to other countries than before. Unless it’s planned they meet there. I’ll try to find out.

Thanks for all the replies it’s just too many. 



UPDATE: 

Thanks for all the replies didn’t expect it to blow up like that. Especially the longer and serious replies. I have to admit some of the others made me laugh which I definitely needed. 

Sorry to all the women for my choice of words. English isn’t my first language. 

We’re currently still on a 2 day no contact arrangement which I gave her to think properly and to reconsider what she said and asks from me. And so I would have time to process. 

I made my decision within a split second to break things off after she brought it up, if she is sticking to the idea.
I’m also convinced we can’t continue like this if she drops the idea since she put the relationship on the line.
But I need some time to process what has even hit me. 

I asked for a woman’s perspective because I couldn’t make sense of it and neither could the friend I asked. He was baffled since he knows her and couldn’t make much sense of it either. 
But I’m open for any perspectives. 

It’s like she did a 180 in those 3 weeks and I don’t recognize her. 

I can’t wrap my head around it because she was the most loving, empathetic and caring person/partner.
The type other people are jealous of.

I don’t wanna defend her but I don’t think she cheated on her last trip. 
Call me delusional idc.

But she came back and communicated her thoughts and feelings. I’m ready to talk about anything but putting the relationship on the line and giving an ultimatum isn’t the way.

But you guys definitely opened my eyes with her probably meeting that person on the second trip. 

I don’t think she would get into a relationship as some suggested and use me as a back up when things don’t work out. Because it’s unlikely she met somebody from our country / city as she won’t relocate (family/ job). At least from what I know … and apparently I don’t know shit. So who knows. 

I’m also not her financial security or provider. We both make decent money but she earns more than me. 

But it could be a full 3 months holiday fling thing as you guys said.

Even though she said I cloud visit her. 

Anyways since y’all asking for updates I will report back. I’ll investigate and ask further questions when we see each other to see how she reacts to certain things to maybe make it easier to get over her or to ease the pain. 


UPDATE 2.0:

Thanks for all the serious replies. Much appreciated. I read every single comment but couldn’t be asked to reply. 

After lots of talking we broke things off. Too much to get into tbh. I was able to cancel the lease. Still gotta pay a compensation of at least a one month rent. But she covers it. I’m blacklisted with the property management group for 3 years for canceling after signing. But I have my place so I’m good…

Special thanks to u/Capital-Abrocoma-257 who shared an really interesting point which I researched and it made a lot if sense to both of us and definitely plays a part.

"""I'm your wife not your mom."" My wife F32 always says this to me 34M and I don't know how to respond. How can I make her see my side?","Hey Everyone,

So my wife 32F and I 34M have been together 18 years but have been arguing recently about the responsibilities within our marriage and we cant seem to agree.

I work full time and my wife is a stay at home mother. We have 2 children one is in school full time and the other goes to preschool 2 1/2 days a week.

Recently my wife has been sending me the stupid tiktoks that always say ""Your wife is your partner, not your mom"" and essentially boil down to men should help out round the house, help with the kids and pick up after themselves. A sentiment I generally agree with.

This usually comes with a side of ""You don't value what I do, to look after the kids and plan everything etc""

Now to be clear, I am not against helping out round the house and helping get the kids to bed, and brush their teeth and cook meals. I do help with this stuff everyday.

I feel like all I do is work, because the second I finish work, I have kids to help with because she ""Has had them all day"".

My position is, that she is right when she says kids are work and I can appreciate that after a day of being with them all day ,that she is probably tired of kids. But I have also been at work all day too and it isn't fair to expect me to be sole parent as soon as I'm finished.

Then there is the issue of housework. Our house is always a mess, which frustrates me when she complains about having to do all the ""unpaid labor"" of managing a household and looking after the kids. Because from my perspective I go to work in a messy house and I finish work in a messy house.( I work from home, go into my office for 8 hours, only coming out for the occasional coffee and snack) Which means that 90% of my mess is contained to a room only I go in. Most days while I'm at work she isn't even home.

I feel that I am holding up my end of the bargain by working full time and then helping with housework and the kids outside of that. But she isn't holding up her end of it by looking after the house and kids while i'm at work. I could understand that she wouldn't get as much done around the house on days when our youngest is home but on days where she is at preschool, she take it as an opportunity to ""have a break"" and go shopping with her mom or go visit a friend.

Whenever I bring this up or question how much effort she is putting in I get ""you don't appreciate me"" and ""i'm not your mother""

I'm not saying she should be waiting on me hand and foot as my personal maid, cook and sexdoll (not that we ever have sex) because ""I'm the man, bringing home the bacon.""  and I really hope I don't come across that way in this post as that really not what i'm saying.

But I am killing myself trying to do everything, yet am being told i'm the problem for treating her like my mother, because i'm expecting her to do her part.

What can I do to help her see my side?  


########UPDATE 1 ""Yes, I ""help"". #######

So a lot of people are saying we need to sit down and try to look at things as a team and I am totally on board for this approach and will let you know how it goes. 

Also to a few people dislike my framing of ""helping"" as it's my responsibility also. 

I agree, I used the term helping as thats the word she uses when saying I need to do more to ""help"" around the house.

Another lot of you either can't read or are refusing to believe that I actually parent my own children. 

I wake them up in the morning. I make them breakfast everyday. I get them dressed everyday. I take them to school 2-3 days a week. I know their teachers, I know all their friends and their friends parents names. I know their doctors, I know their allergies (none thankfully). I bath them, I get their PJs on and read them the same god damn bed time story everynight for weeks. Because they dont want any of the other books we have, they want George the giant. I draw with them, I play games with them, I know their favourite disney princesses and favourite superheroes.   


As for the household I do laundry, I load the dishwasher, I cook my own lunches and tidy up after myself. I iron, I fold and put away laundry, I pick up their toys and tidy their play room. I hoover at the weekend and take them to kids parties. I also do all the chores that my wife wont because ""Im the man"" Like taking out the bins, cleaning the car, mowing the grass, fixing anything that breaks. 

#####Update 2... days later, After ""The talk"" ######

So, I arranged for the in-laws to have the kids Friday night. Me and the wife sat down and had a talk. A LONG talk, probably one of the deepest and hardest talks we have ever had in our 18 years. 

I told her my side, that I felt overwhelmed and underappreciated. That I felt I was doing more than my fair share and that she wasn't. I told her that I could understand that while I may be doing plenty around the house and parenting, that I was guilty of letting her take the majority of the mental load but that still didn't excuse her behaviour. 

I felt I was firm but fair and to her credit instead of fighting back she listened. 

We discussed her feelings and she admits to not prioritising housework and trying to make the most of her ""free time"" and agreed that we will sit down and come up with a schedule for cleaning that we are both accountable for. 

She told me some issues that I wasn't aware of that her mother had been dealing with since retiring and the passing of her father (wife's grandad). loneliness &  depression, issues relating to my SIL ( she's a mess and constant headache). which was why she had been going to see her so much. 

Other feelings she had been having about feeling lost in kids, not having anything for herself and some depression related to weight gain since having our second child. She has put on 40-50lbs and no longer feels attractive. I told her that I still think she's beautiful but she doesn't. Hence our DB. 

There were hurt feelings and tears from both of us. 

So we are taking steps to help. 

1. We have both agreed to switch out mornings and evenings. I get the kids up,  breakfasts, teeth, dressed and take them to school. She does Dinner, bath, bed etc. the next day we switch. this gives us both some mornings/evenings free to do what we want. 

2. We are both joining the gym, I too have put on some weight and lost muscle since our second child. hopefully this helps with her body confidence. 

3. We are also arranging with the In-laws to have babysitters once a week for us to start going on regular dates again.( for context the in-laws are our only support, I'm an orphan of abusive, raised by my grandmother, now passed.)

4. We have found a cleaning schedule, where you do certain chores throughout the house everyday but pick one room to ""deep clean"" everyday too. With me doing laundry, dishwasher etc things that take less time. Her doing the deep cleans and general tidying. 

5. Most importantly she is looking to get a job part-time so she can start helping financially, give her some income that isn't from me and give her something to focus on outside of being a mom.

As all my wages went into the joint account, I felt like I never had any money as I didn't want to spend and there not be enough to pay the mortgage etc. So I never spent money and resented that she did.

So when she gets a job both incomes are going into the joint account, then we are getting a budget together. 

Making sure there is enough to cover direct debits, then dividing the remaining into accounts for savings and personal accounts for each of us to have our own money that we can spend how we want guilt free. 

6. I'm going to pick up a hobby that gets me out of the house and commute to the office once a week.  One thing we discussed was that I was always at home. I didn't do anything other than work and be at home. So we didn't have a lot to talk about, because I didn't go anywhere. 

It also meant that she never got any alone time at home away from me and the kids and she felt like a nuisance being at home while I'm at work. 

We took this weekend to spend some time together as a family, took the kids to the park, went to a nature reserve for a picnic and bike rides. Took the kids rock climbing followed by ice-cream. It was really nice and we both feel like a weight has been lifted. it's obviously not going to change overnight and we need to work at it. but we have a plan and both seem to want to put in the effort. 

To everyone who gave me good advice, recommended therapy (we can't afford it until she starts work but we are looking for when she does.) commiserated with your own stories or just had a kind word to say. Thank You So Much, there were comments that made me cry and so much insight that I hadn't considered. Thank you.

To those of you who clearly didn't read my post but instead assumed I was entitled and entirely to blame because I used the word ""help"". Or that I probably didn't know my own children's birthdays and allergies. I feel sorry for you and hope that you get the ""help"" you so sorely need. ",1708702081.0,Onikem,relationship_advice
40F & 45M in a new relationship; I woke up to his girl best friend standing in his bedroom at 2am. How do I navigate this?,"TL;DR at the end 

I (40F) am in a new relationship, & my bf (45M) did tell me that he & his gbf (girl best friend, F40’s?) briefly dated a few years ago & slept together once, but realized they’re better as friends. I felt a bit wary, but am also aware that I have friendships with men I have been with, and there’s truly nothing there (for me, at least).

I do believe him when he says it’s totally platonic for him, though he has mentioned his most recent ex (they were together for 1.5+ years) wasn’t the gbf’s biggest fan, but to each their own. Gbf sounded cool and he mentioned we have a lot of things in common (she & I), and he could see us becoming good friends. Exes have requested some distance between gbf & bf as it made them uncomfortable, but I decided not to worry about it until I met her & judged for myself. 

The other night I was spending the night at my bf’s when I woke up to a woman who had entered the apartment & came straight to his bedroom doorway & just fucking stared at us in his bed. When I first heard the sound of the door unlocking & a light click on, I was sleeping and thought it was part of a dream until I realized it was real. He was sleeping suuuper soundly and I was trying to wake him up by patting his arm, rubbing his chest, touching his face, talking to him, & I was frantic bc I don’t know who she was, how she got in, and why she was there at 2am.

She just stared for a few mins and he was having a hard time waking up… by the time I finally was able to wake him up, she was gone… the only thing she said was “sorry for disturbing you.”

Understandably, it takes him a few mins to get his bearings, I describe the woman, he states who it sounds like, then shows me a pic - it’s gbf. He checked his calls and texts, and the last time she texted him was the day before. A few mins later she was blowing up his phone and he finally answered, and she said something about being scared & needing to talk to him. He told her off & ended the call, but she continued to call & text for the next hour & was pissed that he wouldn’t come out & talk with her.

She has a bf, and she obviously knows about me. Bf & I live about 1.5 hrs apart so I was there for about an hour after this happened, when I told him I was going home (I wanted to make sure I was ok to drive & I was just stunned & trying to process this anddd I didn’t know where she was & I was scared to run into her).

He reached out to me the next day in the late morning & early afternoon, not sure if I wanted to talk to him or not. As it turns out, she let herself in - for the first time ever, having not called or texted first - to tell him she’s in love with him & wanted him to choose her over me. He was shocked but laid is boundaries out, and she said that she can’t be just friends with him so their friendship is over.

He’s had a lot of loss in his life, and she was a big part of his support system over the last few years so he’s grieving the loss of the friendship (bc this is freshhhh), & I don’t know how to process any of this. He really does seem blindsided & never imagined she would do that.

Yeah, I listen to/watch a lot of true crime - I’m the one who locked the door before we went to bed so I KNOW it was locked, but at first I thought maybe a neighbor entered the wrong apartment, and then while she stared for a few mins while I was panicking & trying to wake me up, I was like “oh fuck, she might be a crazy ex & she might hurt us!”

I have never thought about what I’d do in this situation bc I never in a million years thought I’d be in it, but holy fuckkkkk.

His apartment is keyless entry, she knew the access codes bc they were good friends for several years & he travels internationally for work a few weeks at a time & needed someone to water plants/grab mail. He’s planning on connecting with apartment management to change both of the codes

I don’t know what I think or need, but it’s very clear that he doesn’t understand how truly unhinged and traumatic this was for me. 

Validate me? Give me perspective? 

What. The actual. Fuck.

—————————-

TL;DR boyfriend’s girl best friend let herself into his apartment at 2am, scaring the shit outta me bc I didn’t know who she was or why she was there. He says it’s been platonic for 2 years, but she came to tell him she’s in love with him (they briefly dated a few years ago). I know most people would prob break up immediately, but those were her actions and he never expected it bc she hasn’t done that before.

—————————-

This is the first red flag I’ve seen from him — how do I process this and possibly move forward? Do I end it or do we pump the brakes? I’m aware that most people are the rule, not the exception but I feel like he’s being honest & I don’t know if I’m being too trusting.

Edit: Clarifications
1. Ok, the biggest glaring clarification is that I labeled her gbf — bc it’s easier to say than explain the whole think. She is not among those few that he considers his best friends, but she was the closest female friend he had.

2. I think we are both still shocked that it happened - she was a safe friend for him up until that happened, and I’m sure it’s a mindfuck to come to terms with how big of a deal it is. He took her at her word that they were just friends. 

3. He plans on talking to his therapist & his friends, & I’m talking to mine too. He broke things off with her bc of incompatibilities (I don’t know if he named them all to her) but for him, it has been absolutely only platonic since they decided to become just friends after.

4. “Exes asked for distance between them” is really that one 18mo relationship (or so, I don’t have his previous relationships memorized — bc they’re previous), but it sounds like that gf had a very small circle of friends bc she was difficult to get along with, and I think he just chalked it up to that gf’s insecurities and put distance with gbf. 

Along those lines, I can see how he went there bc whenever I start a new employment opportunity it always feels like the coworkers (men and women) think we’re in competition. I lay the groundwork with “hey I’m not in competition with anyone here. We’re a valuable team together bc we all have our own approaches.” There are some women that are hard to get along with & they know it, and I broke off a friendship a few months ago bc she was like that. It happens. 

5. Keyless entry is keyless. There’s a pad at the front door to enter a number, and then another pad on his front door to enter another. They’re friends, I have access to my friends’ places, he travels internationally for work & has plants… I wasn’t pressed. I trusted his trust in her, and she broke it.

6. I truly don’t believe they’re fwb. It’s not his style, he’s not interested in her, whatever. Maybe she was drunk and hyped up on hallmark movies, I don’t know AND it was still scary af for me. 

ADD: she was still wearing her coat, completely zipped up, & her shoes. If you’re banging someone on the reg, you’re not coming to the bedroom with a coat & shoes still on. 

7. I don’t think he’s gotten to the point of realizing that she might have snuck in other times. I told him I feel violated and he should too. He’s a science guy so he’s very methodical and rational, and I think he’s so shocked and pissed by what she did, he literally doesn’t know what to say. 

8. He’s changing the codes. I said that already, in the novel. 

________________________

UPDATE 10/29/24 My initial post was stream of consciousness, for all you nitpickers. I did not go back & correct my word choice or spelling errors. It’s beyond lengthy af now, but y’all don’t have to read it. 

I’ve been trying to read all the responses & I feel like I’ve responded & answered a lot of questions, but here are some more:

1. Why Reddit? Obviously Reddit isn’t my go-to for advice, but it’s an easy/quick way to get a variety of opinions without spreading this shit out to everyone in my actual life. I have been talking to a few friends, and honestly it’s been validating that I’ve seen pretty much all of the thoughts I’ve had running through my head on this thread. When he told me that he thought I was going to break up with him each time we talked over the following few days and acknowledged most people would, I agreed that he’s probably right but I don’t want to be that quick to judge him. He trusted her & took her at her word that her feelings were also simply platonic. She broke that trust.

2. I’ve seen a fair amount of people come for me bc I “came for him” - again, you can’t know what you would do unless it happened to you. I wasn’t trying to come for him, I was trying to process & be rational. I woke up to a fucking stranger staring at us - I didn’t know who she was until later (she’s STILL a stranger to me) & I’m honestly not sure if it would be creepier if it was a stranger or that it’s ex gbf.

3. Her coat: it’s been chilly up here. It was an ill-fitting puffer jacket, she was also wearing jeans, and it appeared that she was wearing an oversized sweater underneath. It wasn’t a fleabag-sexy-lingerie-under-the-long-jacket situation.

4. Entering the apartment building/apartment/bedroom: for the lastttt time, it’s keyless entry. The main entry to the building has a keypad for you to enter the code, hold your fob up to the thing, or call the person whose apartment it is so they can buzz you in. There’s a different code for his front door, and it sounds like when you use a hotel keycard. The bedroom door was open bc my dog was there and was initially sleeping on the couch, but eventually moved to the floor in the bedroom (she’s used to sleeping on my bed at home & snuggling up). Additionally, I realized last night that the reason she might not have come further into the bedroom is bc my dog was sleeping on the floor next to my bf. I heard her collar jangle so I don’t know if she stood up or just looked at ex gbf, but she’s not a small dog.

5. Again, we all think we know what we’d do but there were a million factors flying through my mind. If this had happened at my house, my reaction would likely be different bc it’s mine & I know who has access to my place and who doesn’t. It wasn’t my house, I was almost naked, I was literally in the farthest back corner in his apartment and she’s clearly been awake the whole time while I woke up to this & couldn’t wake him. 

6. I wasn’t gently trying to wake him btw - most people would wake up if someone touched their face. I was shaking and tapping him, & thought something had happened to him when it took so long to wake him.

7. Somebody nailed it when they noted that it seems like part of my issue is that he didn’t react immediately how I expected him to, in that he didn’t run out into the hallway to catch her/see who it was. He woke up from a dead sleep. This is a fuckton to process. When he realized it was her, maybe he thought something terrible had happened to her and that’s why she did something he’s never expected - I can’t answer for him. I told him that I feel violated and they he should too, but again, up until this moment, he thought she was a trusted, safe, respectful, platonic friend. What a mindfuck.

8. He woke up from a dead sleep & knew I was scared & frantic, but he couldn’t process quickly. He checked the apartment, figured out it was her, and was pissed not scared. This is a big generalization, but men are not generally scared of women. He told me last night that he doesn’t remember much bc most of it happened when he was sleeping, but he could barely keep his eyes open. He couldn’t come with me back to my place bc he had things to do, and he was pissed at her, not scared.

9. Yeah I worded it poorly and said it was the first red flag for him - no, it’s not his red flag but the event was a red flag. He’s taken the steps to make me feel safer & more respected, and it might be awhile before I feel ok staying there again.

10. Yes, we’re staying together. He’s honestly the best partner I’ve ever had - calm, rational, affirming, kind, caring - all the things a partner should be. For everyone who jumped straight to ending it, work on being less reactive, work through your trauma, and stop projecting your baggage onto other people.

I don’t know that I’ll update again, but thank you, sincerely, to all the kind people who validated me, helped me process, & assisted me with finding clarity. 

This isn’t tied up neatly & finished - they live in a city that’s big, but “small town.” They’re going to run into each other, they have common friends, it’s going to be uncomfortable to navigate, but he’s committed to good boundaries & making sure I feel safe, respected, & heard in our relationship. He understands where I’m coming from and didn’t take any of it personally. 

___________________________

UPDATE 11/21: yeah, he’s not a gem & all y’all saying he’s shady were right. I don’t know if he was sleeping with GBF, but I do now know that he was dating & sleeping with multiple women & of course telling all of us that he wasn’t talking to anyone else.

Of course he tried to gaslight me when I called him out… I know this gets thrown around a lot on here but the man seriously has psychopathic vibes. It didn’t sit right with me when he asked me last time he was at my house if I thought my dog would defend me if someone came in, and I stupidly admitted that she’d probably be fine with someone she knows, but yeah, I think she would fight for me if I was actually being hurt.

Anyway, things were already on a down slope for me before I found out & talked to some of the other women, and I put it out there that I’d be interested in talking to the ex wife, the gbf, and another female “friend” that he mentioned a lot. Part of his MO is saying he’s an extrovert so he’s always out & about doing things with friends, but that’s how he covers his tracks. He said his mom died a few months ago (while we were in our first couple of dates) & and now says his dad is dying of cancer… which may be true, but I have a lot of doubts about it now. He told one of the other women he was supporting his dad after mom died, but he really came up & spent the night with me.

So… yeah. Back to being single I go bc there are too many men with their bullshit. I have yet to find a therapist who can help me see people for who they are. It’s a chronic issue that I think people are my friends but they’re talking shit behind me, and this is the second guy who pulled this shit on me (that I know of).

Once again I don’t trust my judgement, so that’s fun.

Good luck out there y’all!

UPDATE 11/24

I talked to the ex wife & let me just say - she’s amazing & might be my new idol! I only went through a few months of his bullshit, but they were married for quite some time. Still waiting to hopefully talk with GBF bc I have a feeling I was the other woman to her & she didn’t know about me… and I wish she would’ve said it that night if it’s true, but also my not-small dog was there, so… I’d prob be nervous about that too

I blocked him on everything & I knowwww it’s killing him to have no access to me. It makes me smile haha ",1730066194.0,Salty_Sense_7662,relationship_advice
My (21F) bf (20M) won’t let me take an internship. How can I convince him to let me?,"
I’m a 21 F College student and my 20M bf is from a different college. I recently got hired to do my dream job (its a marketing internship) which I’ve been talking to him about since high school (I’ve had my eye on this job for SOOO LONG). It’s mostly work from home and going on site once a week. My unemployed bf is mad that I’ll work some nights because “you don’t need a job while in college” and i really don’t wanna leave this opportunity just because he isn’t comfortable with it. He also mentioned that because i have “male coworkers” he doesn’t trust them. I don’t have any history of cheating on him but he cheated on me once and I took him back (because we’re childhood friends and we’ve been together for so long ) Is there any way I can convince him to let me take this job peacefully?

additional info: I go to the top university of my country on a scholarship and I also research for the government on the side but he’s okay with it because it’s a work from home thing and doesn’t need to work on site. 


note: I’m taking the internship no matter what, the argument part is paused because he’s blocked me on everything (will update how that turns out). Thank you guys for all the advice. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this with because my friends and family don’t like him either, so I’m thankful for everyone giving their two cents. I can’t reply to everyone because I have a fever right now but I’m definitely reading all your insights. I’ve been with him since I was 12 and in a relationship when I was 16. I’ve been here for so long I didn’t realize how absurd it was to other people’s perspective. 

update: Hey guys, its been a really tough day. Last night, he unblocked me then called me to call it off. He said that I don’t respect the relationship and if what he says doesn’t matter then what is the point of being “partners”. I didn’t really have to opportunity to say anything much because he was set on ending it last night. I no longer got to discuss any compromises or whatever because he already decided for us. I’m actually glad because I didn’t think I had the courage to end it yet if it was up to me, so good that he was already set on it. Thank you guys for all your inputs and insights and I promise I read them all. As for the messages, thank you I’ll try to reply to them as well. I don’t think he’ll do anything more because he’s blocked me again and changed his profile picture and other stuff on social media (which is funny because I never post on social media because it always causes an argument). As for me, I also applied for this Harvard conference that I hope I also get invited to. I’ll continue with my extracurriculars and not let this discourage me from it. Thank you guys for being my reddit friends (because I don’t trust mine as much anymore) and thank you for opening my eyes. I hope the best for you guys’ relationships and hopefully learn from me as well (though I’m no role model). I’m scared but excited for this new chapter of my life.

Cousin (F24) falsely accused me (M31) of sxual assault. Now my family is contacting me after almost 10 years,"**I first posted this on 'relationships' and it got autoremoved and I got no answer when I tried to get them to check it manually.**

**Please note that NO ONE involved is under 18 anymore and the situation DID NOT involve sxual abuse. That's the whole point.**

Hi,

I've never had an account on Reddit before, but someone on another forum linked this subreddit and I've been reading some stories. If this is the wrong subreddit, please let me know. Also english is not my first language, so bear with me.

It's pretty much like the title says. I just feel so lost on what to do. This is tearing up wounds and old rage is building again.

Let me give some backstory.

I've grew up in what was probably the most normal of normal households. Parents worked a lot, but still managed to care for me and my 3 older sisters. We were never super close as a family, but never had any issues either. Same goes for my extended family. They always lived a few hours away, but we saw each other during summer holidays or christmas and always got along great. But when we got older we naturally grew apart as everyone had their own lives.

I'm 31 now. In 2014, when I was 22 and attending Uni, I got a phone call from my mother that turned my life upside down. I remember I didn't even answer at first, because I was gaming with friends. But she called again immidiately after the first call. This was an unwritten rule in the family. If you call twice like that, it's important. Like someone died-important. So when she called again, I excused myself and answered, only to hear chaos in the other end. Like people were arguing. But when my mom realized I had answered, it sounded like she went to another room and closed the door. I just asked what was going on and I heard she was crying. My memory of this conversation is a bit blurry, but she basically asked me if I had something to confess to regarding ""E"".

E is my cousin on my moms side and is 7 years younger than me, 15 at the time. At that point I hadn't even seen E for several years.

I just said no and asked what this is about. She just cried even harder and started accusing me of sxually assaulting E back when we were children. That E had told everything to my sister, and that my sister told my mother and my aunt. E had told them that back when she was 9 (and I 16), she'd been playing in my room when I came in and started feeling her under her clothes and kissing her. My mother screamed at me to say something, but I couldn't even speak. It was all so absurd. I remember thinking that must be some bad joke.

The last thing I remember saying was that it's not true and that E is lying. But then my mom goes on saying that how E gave such a detailed description of where and how. Then she kept asking something like ""did you do this?! did you do this?!"" and I just scream back at her ""no!"" each time. It all ended with my mom putting me on speaker and both my mom and dad saying that they don't want anything to do with me and never to contact them again. Two of my sisters texted me later that day, pretty much saying that I'm disgusting and then blocked me.

I know it's weird, but after that call I went to have a long shower. To this day I still don't know why I did that. After calming down, I started calling and texting everyone, even E. No one answered and the ones who hadn't blocked my number by then quickly did so. The only thing I heard back was from my father who texted me to stop contacting them and that they need to heal.

That was 9 years ago and I haven't spoken to anyone in my family since that day.

To say this f\*cked me up is an understatement. I was living in a haze for weeks after that and hardly ate at all. It didn't help that this was right before I was supposed to defend my bachelors thesis and was already stressed out. Luckily my co-writer sensed something was up and saved me by controlling the conversation so that I got the easy parts. Without him I sure I would've failed. Needless to say, no one came to my graduation.

Then started the worst period of my life. I spent the first year expecting the cops to knock on my door and arresting me for sexual abuse. I didn't land any jobs, just living off my saved money. I drank a lot and did oxy. I also grew resentful and violent. The only reason I didn't hurt anyone is because no one was around. My neighbour called the cops on me once after I had smashed a glass, but I managed to convince the officers that I had just dropped it, and they went away since there were no others inside my apartment. Instead of sleeping, I spent my nights planning how I could hurt E and make sure no one ever found out. Even thinking how I could actually do the things she'd accused me of, but much worse. (I know, I'm not proud of that)

I landed my first ""real"" job in my field in late 2015. Only then did things start to improve. I focused all my time on my job, as it gave me something ""normal"" to do. Recovery was a slow process, but I drank less (sober now for 4+ years) and smiled more. I lived cheap and earned good money, so I made a point of buying myself a nice gift for my birthdays, a VR headset, a motorcycle, Lego etc. And last year I moved from my shitty apartment and bought a small house. It was an old dream of mine to have my own garage and a garden to care for. This has boosted me even more.

So my life is ""OK"" now. I still got problems. I've been on anti-depressants for the last few years and while they help, it's not in a happy way. They simply remove the dark thoughts and replace them with dead ones. My trust in other people is close to non-existent. I've tried dating, but only been on two dates with two different women. It's really hard to speak like a normal person when it comes down to it. And what would I tell a potential partner when she ask about my family? ""Oh you know they accused me of a heinous crime and we're not talking anymore. But I didn't do it, I swear!"" My field is very male dominated, so the only woman I really speak to is my therapist, who I like a lot.

If this text was difficult to follow, I apologize. I'm not good with words on the best of days, and I started rambling a bit when it all came back to me. It's already getting long so I will fast forward to my current issue.

A few days ago, I received a text from my mother. It felt unreal and I was scared to open it at first, so I just stared at the notification for hours before opening it. Yesterday, another text followed. Translated, they basically say:

Text 1:

Hi, <my name>

It's been so long since we talked. We miss you and want to know how you're doing.

<Here she writes a long text about my sisters and how my neices and nephews are getting big. I didn't even know I was an uncle.>

Know that we love you and always will.

\-Mom and dad

Text 2:

Hi, <my name>

We understand if you don't want to talk to us after what happened, but please listen.

Last month, the subject of you was brought up at a family gathering. During this, E was downplaying everything that had happened to her. It got so awkward that she finally admitted that nothing happened and that she probably just dreamt it. We were all appalled by this.

When we last spoke, we wanted to protect E and did the only thing we thought we could do. We know that's not excusing how you were treated.

What E did was wrong and we're all angry at her. We have called everyone that knew and told them the truth.

We all want to speak with you and your sisters want you to meet their families.

Please write back if you can find it in you to forgive us.

\-Mom and dad

So yeah. That's my situation right now. I haven't answered, but they no doubt know I've seen it. Truth be told, I'm seething. Soo many old, shitty memories are now stirring again. I don't want to forgive them and I wouldn't trust myself to be in the same room as them right now. Part of me wants to call my family and unleash everything on them, to guilt them with everything I went through until they all hit their rock bottom. Then dedicate my life to make my cousins life as miserable as possible. The other part wants to ignore them and continue with my OK-ish life with my motorcycle and my garden to keep me company.

I don't have any friends. The only people I speak to are my coworkers, but we're not really close. I've called my therapists clinic, but they told me she's on vacation and won't be available for weeks, and I don't want anyone else than her.

So that leaves internet strangers. So please, where to go from here? Do I ignore them and continue as is?Or do I answer? And if so, what to even write? I'm pretty sure meeting them in person would be a bad idea for a forseeable future, but I'm not even sure how my life can improve from picking up those old threads. As embarrasing at it may sound, I've dreamed about the day when they apologized to be them throwing themselves to the ground and kissing my feet. Texting seems so anticlimactic now.

TL;DR

My cousin falesly accused me of sxual assaulting her when we were minors and I was disowned. Now it has been revealed that it never happened and my family is contacting me and wants to make amends. I don't know how to respond.

&#x200B;

Edit:

holy shit, I went to bed yesterday after answering a couple of comments. I was happy then when someone just said to wait for mt therapist to come back, something that had flown over my head. Now theres 1300 comments. I can't possibly answer all, but I'll try to read all when I get home from work.

I just want to address something I saw a few people mention. That my therapist wouldnt leave for that long without telling me. I don't know how this works in other places. But this is a state run clinic, no hourly rate or anything. I got assigned to her when first going there, which means she will continue to ""get me"" on meetings that follows. But that is not 100%. If she's on leave or sick, I might get someone else. 4-6 weeks of vacation is not uncommon.

My (26F) friend (23F) injured my eye and I lost half my vision. How do I continue this friendship?,"I’m (26F) in dental school right now and my friends and I went to play badminton at school.

I was with one partner and we were playing really well. Then we wanted to rotate partners so I got paired with a girl, I’ll call her Dana. She doesn’t really play sports but it seemed like she really wanted to be my partner. So I said sure.

While playing, we bumped into each other a lot. I don’t think she’s very good at sports. When I called on the birdie she would still go for it. 

Long story short, we collided once more but this time she swung her racket directly on my eye. I lost my vision for two hours and I went to the ER. It was just grey. Nothing else.

But she was laughing the entire time, I feel like it was nervous laughter. I tried to stay calm and positive just because all my friends were there. We’re also going to be in the same class for the next 4 years and I didn’t want to create tension.

Either way I noticed the entire time she was just laughing. She went to the ER with me but she was still kinda nervously laughing. 

I had to go to the ophthalmologist next morning at 8am and the tests they did on me were uncomfortable and painful. It made me think about how I’m spending the one day during dental school where I could’ve taken a break, instead I spent it there and I was dilated that I couldn’t study the entire day. Everything was blurry for about 7 hours.

Doctors said I have damage on my retina and some bleeding in the back of my eye. My vision should return in 1-4 months, but there’s a risk this vision loss could be permanent.

And then there was a get together with the same friends and she was there. She was laughing the entire time again and joked about my eye too. She doesn’t seem to understand the severity of the situation and it irks me.

Now I want to ask her for compensation. Cover all my Uber fees going to and from the hospital. And my optometry appt fees.

I didn’t go to class today because my eye didn’t feel great and I didn’t want to see her face either. Today she went for sushi with our classmates and I saw the group photo and she’s smiling so widely, it bothers me even more.

I don’t really know how to handle this situation. I don’t want to create drama, or tension. I also don’t want to affect my relationships with my other friends in our friend group. But I’m fucking pissed man. And scared that this could be permanent.

How do I continue this friendship? I don’t know how to handle this. I don’t think her parents know either. I didn’t tell my parents because they’re going on a Europe trip and I don’t want to worry them when they finally got a vacation. I just feel stuck.

TLDR; my friend from school hit her badminton racket in my eye and I lost half of my vision. I want her to compensate. And I also don’t know how to continue this friendship without feeling bitter

—————-

Edit 1:

Omg I did not expect this post to gain so much attention. I’m trying my best to read everyone’s comments, so sorry if I don’t respond to it.

Just as an update: 

I reached out to Dana as some of you have suggested, and I asked her to compensate. I told her I wish to keep good relations with her, and that I’d like to be transparent about my situation. I told her that I have been paying everything out of pocket, which has not been easy, and it’s been a difficult time for me because this vision loss has been affecting my mental state as well. 

She said “yes of course! Let me know how much and I can send you what you need.” And then she sent me $200, even though I didn’t ask for any amount. She said that should be enough for now.

For some reason, her response felt…. Empty(?) it felt more like she was compensating for broken glasses. It sounded like she just wanted to send the money and end with it. But at least I know that she’s open to pay for the fees.

For the past few days, she has been going out eating sushi with friends, apple picking, and having a lot of fun.

She seems unaffected. I don’t need her to drop on her knees apologizing her heart out, nor do I need her to give me special treatment. But I’m not sure if this is appropriate to the situation.

If I hit my friend in the eye to the point where she has to go to the ER and lose half her vision, I would feel extremely worried. I don’t think I’d be able to think about going out. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for her. I told my close friends about it and they said the same. I know some of you have mentioned something similar as well.

So emotionally, I decided not to see her or treat her as a friend anymore. Just as a classmate. I saw some of you comment on that, and you’re right. She doesn’t seem like a friend at all.

It’s been a really hard past couple of days. I can’t see well in low light, my right eye vision would have a dark blind spot. But in bright lights it seems okay, just blurry. Adjusting to this has been hard, and it’s been harder trying to figure out how to tell my family afterwards.

So I really really appreciate everyone’s support and encouragement! It warms my heart. And it brings me hope that things will get a lot better.

Today I went to my family optometrist just as a check up, and the optometrist said that I will be okay, and I have nothing to worry about. He also saw the blood inside the back of my eye, and that I will have visual impairment for about a month or so. Fortunately, he already sees signs of healing. My eye starts to hurt if I use it too much though, probably because it’s trying to adjust to that dark area that covers the top half my vision. I’ve been keeping that eye closed when it starts to hurt. So I plan to use an eyepatch to relieve some of that fatigue. Unfortunately I’ll have to wear that during class as well.

I’m really glad to hear that this will only be temporary. I was upset about why this happened to me. But perhaps it was an early warning sign to stay away from Dana.

I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt. But I’m not sure if she deserves it.

To be honest, I don’t know if I want her $200 anymore. It feels like dirty money to me. So maybe I just send it back to her.

I might update more later. Thank you everyone for now

—————-

Edit 2:

I just wanted to add, I’m not sure how feasible it would be to sue Dana. As a dental student with a lot of student debt, I don’t think I’d be able to afford it. And perhaps this would be something to do if I lose my vision permanently, rather than the state I am in right now. Unless anyone has any further advice on this subject.

——————-

Edit 3:

I read some of the more recent comments and I see some people saying to take the money and get over it, or to stop stalking her social media.

I’d like to clarify, the photos that I’m seeing are ones she has been sharing in our friend group chat. I have not looked at her social media. Nor am I interested. 

It’s been 3 days since the accident. I’ve spent those three days at the hospital, ophthalmologist and optometry clinic. I missed out on the events and hangouts that were organized by my friends and school due to my eye, whereas she went to every single one. Even on the night of the accident. I also haven’t been able to attend class or study well. So she has been sharing how much fun she’s been having with our classmates. Which makes me question why she’s trying so hard to make me feel left out. Because she didn’t really share photos before. 

Again, I am aware that this was an accident. I don’t need her life to end or be miserable. I don’t need her to mourn or drop to her knees and apologize or anything. I just wonder about her intentions.

I don’t need her to be guilt ridden, but I would’ve wished for my friend to at least be concerned about me. I did not expect my friend to laugh when she hit me, laugh when I said I said I couldn’t see through that eye, laugh or gossip while we were at the ER, or still go out having fun, even at the night of, and post photos consistently in our group chat while I was spending those past few days going to the hospital and clinics worried that this was going to be permanent. Again, I don’t need her to feel super guilty, cry for days and not live her life. But just as a friend, I would’ve hoped for her to still be there for me. And her actions felt a bit insensitive for the situation.

I see some mixed responses as well. It seems to range from suing her, forgetting about it, or ending her dental career haha. I think I will just stick with communicating with her privately for now. And see how everything goes

And in terms of her money, I could just keep it like some of you mentioned. Just thinking about the future and long-term though, I hope that that $200 isn’t used against me by her. I think that’s my biggest concern. Some people in the comments raised concerns whether she’s a true friend or not. So I’d like to be cautious.

Not being able to see through half of my eye has been scary and an adjustment. I called my parents today and told them about my situation and they got really worried. But I told them I was okay and was able to end the conversation well. So I’m glad that part went okay.

I appreciate everyone’s feedback

I’ve been receiving some nice messages privately wishing me a speedy recovery, and I really appreciate it. It’s been giving me a lot of strength and positivity. I do not use reddit often, and I appreciate this supportive community. So thank you.

At the same time, I’m also receiving messages from people to f* myself and to grow up. I didn’t expect such responses as well.

My (28F) husband (31M) of 6 weeks says he wants to be single... we have been together for 9 wonderful/happy years. Is this salvageable or is this the end?,"UPDATE:

Confirmed that he is 100% cheating, which sucks but was also vindicating and actually makes me feel better about the gut feeling I had about the girl.

Thank you all SO much for all the kind comments and messages I have received. It's been so helpful to read similar stories and to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The next few months will be rough but I have hope I will come out better on the other side.

-------

TLDR: I was blindsided by my partner of 9 years who suddenly wants to be single right after getting married.

Sorry for how long this will be, but it is such a bizarre and unique situation it requires some context. My partner (31M) and I (28F) have been together for almost 9 years. We always had the best relationship, full of love and joy. We had shared visions of the future, and a very similar financial and ambitious mindset. We fought here and there but in those 9 years we never had any major conflict. We both love each other's families and they love us. Everyone always said they were jealous of our relationship, because it seemed so effortless (and it was!).

We got married about 6 weeks ago, and everything leading up to that point seemed fine. We had a wonderful wedding day and both read heartfelt vows, and cried during the ceremony. I had no reason to believe anything was wrong. About 2 weeks after the wedding we started talking more about the honeymoon (which we planned to take later in the year) and other plans, and he seemed very uneasy with making future plans, started saying that we shouldn't rush and that we just got married and to take it easy. I didn't understand why as I wasn't rushing anything, and this was the plan we had both agreed to earlier (to have the honeymoon about 7 months after the wedding).

Eventually he told me that the whole marriage thing is freaking him out and he's realizing that maybe it's not something he really wanted for himself. That he's feeling weird that we've been together all through our 20s and that I'm the only relationship he has ever had, and he never had enough time to be single. He says he maybe proposed out of societal pressures and because he just felt it's what you were ""supposed to do"". He says I'm perfect and he loves me and he just wishes that we had met 5 years later so he would've had that time to be on his own. I said those are all valid feelings but what are the options here? It's okay to mourn the past but we are already married. He said he had some doubts before the wedding but felt it was already too late as so many people had money in it and I was so excited about it and he didn't want to crush my dreams. In hindsight we both agreed it would've been better had he mentioned it then.

We've now been discussing this for a month (no fights, we just both end up getting very emotional), have tried individual and couples therapy, and I left the house for a couple weeks just to give us both some mental space (we agreed we were still together during that timeframe though). When I came back, he ended up asking for a ""break"" where we are both single for a few months then reconvene at an agreed upon date and see where we are. I was completely shocked by this, and told him that I don't believe in that. We either figure it out together or we are broken up for good. I asked if there is anything else we can do within the relationship to try to get him to a better mental state and he said he didn't think so. He really feels the only option is for us to not be together right now.

I am completely devastated and blindsided by this. I think he is going through some sort of ""grass is greener syndrome"" where he's wondering what else is out there and mourning not being single for longer. But if he does end up going on dates and realizing that it's not as good as he thought, I don't want him to think that I will be waiting on the sidelines as a safety net.

This may or may not be related: I asked him if there's someone else, he said no. But he has been spending some time with a female friend he met at the gym a couple months ago. They work out together 2-3x week (which I don't usually have a problem with - he's a big gym guy and very social and has had other female workout buddies before with no issues). However, he has also started spending time with her after the workout (grabbing a coffee, or a meal together) and being shifty about it with me (this is new for him). While I don't think anything physical has happened, I definitely think there is some emotional cheating there and I wonder if this has impacted his thoughts at all... he swears she has nothing to do with the way he's been feeling and that he's been feeling this way for a while (which i do believe, but maybe this has intensified his feelings?).

He still tells me he loves me every day and is very affectionate with me. He is also apologetic about the way he feels saying he wishes he didn't feel this way and he realizes how unfair it is to me.

I cannot imagine giving up 9 years of history together, especially when we just had such a beautiful wedding that everyone was so excited to be a part of. But the way he has acted for the last month is SO unlike him and doesn't seem at all like the person I have been with all these years. Is this salvageable at all?

My son 45M is dating a much younger girl 19M,"Edit: please stop messaging asking if I want to get revenge by dating a younger man. 


I (69f) have two sons. The younger one (37) is married to his high school girlfriend and they have two daughters. The eldest Sam (45) moved to NYC to focus on his career and now he’s at the point when he can relax a little. All mothers love their sons but he is objectively good looking, tall, smart, successful and kind. He’s had a couple of (his age) long term girlfriends. I’ve always been sad that he hasn’t found a life partner yet but understood he was doing it at his pace - until I met his girlfriend a few days ago. 


Over thanksgiving, both sons flew home to us. My son brought home his girlfriend that he’s been dating for almost a year. I’d heard about her from him and he sounded happy but he’s not the type to share that much with me or his father. When he said he’d like to bring her for thanksgiving we were very excited to finally meet the girl he’s serious about.


When she walked in, we were all shocked. She looked so young! So beautiful and mature but definitely young. I pulled him aside and asked how old she was. He looked embarrassed and said she was turning 20 soon. I never expected him to go for someone so young. Maybe someone 30 or 35 as I know he wants children soon, but not someone in their first year of college. 


We went back to dinner. I didn’t want to make the poor girl feel bad (my husband and younger son staring was rude enough) so I was very welcoming to her. She’s very intelligent, nice, confident and so on but in the manner of a precocious teen. Her family are wealthy so she’s not financially dependent.


Dinner was awkward but fine. At the end of the evening everyone went to bed but it made me feel nauseous to know what was happening in my own house. The next day they (edit: they left together but split when he dropped her at the airport) had to leave early so she could see her family. My son went to visit his childhood friends in our hometown but he’s coming back tomorrow. 


Is this relationship possibly healthy? Can I voice my concerns or is it none of my business? Has anyone dealt with something similar in their family?",1701043879.0,THROWRAhfjocug,relationship_advice
I (32M) just found out my wife of two years (33F) was hooking up with her friend (40M) for six months while we were dating but before we had sex. She says it was to make sure I was serious. I'm now stuck on a group vacation with him. What the hell do I do??,"I'm holed up in my room in a ski chalet while everyone else in our group is still in the village. I'm a little drunk and feeling extremely fucked up about this situation right now.

My wife ""Suzanne"" and I met online four years ago. We'd both had some bad relationships and we both wanted something serious. Early on she told me that she was tired of guys bailing after the relationship turned physical and that she wanted to wait on that front, which I was not just okay with but thought was smart. My most successful relationship before her was with someone where we waited a few months and I appreciated getting to build a friendship to see if we clicked on an emotional level. Suzanne also told me that she understood if I still wanted to date around during that time and didn't expect me to be exclusive until we both explicitly agreed on it. I told her that I wasn't one to try and fight a war on two fronts - I was serious about making it work with one person.

Now, up until last night I thought that she'd felt the same - she never once mentioned seeing other people while we were dating and based on the way she talked about wanting to build an emotional connection I assumed (dumbly I guess?) that she was only seeing me.

We're on this trip with three other couples and her friend ""Josh"". I've always liked him, he and I have had some long convos smoking weed and talking about life and work (we're both in tech). I've always gotten the vibe that he's a kind, caring person who goes out of his way to help his friends. He's a big advocate for people doing therapy and talks openly about what he's working on.

This is where it gets upsetting for me. Last night we got back from skiing and we were all exhausted. I went downstairs to start chopping veggies to help another of the couples cook the group dinner. Suzanne took a shower and I chopped and chatted for like 30 minutes. I came back upstairs to bring Suzanne some wine and I heard her and Josh chatting in our room. No big deal. I walk in and Suzanne is in a towel with her leg up on the bed putting on lotion, talking about her job. It wasn't exactly a compromising position, but it struck me as possibly intimate - if she moved a bit one way or another she'd be giving him a view. She said hi to me, kept putting on lotion, and then grabbed the wine. Totally nonchalant. Josh said it was his turn to shower and left.

Sitting here now I wish to god that I'd just kept my fucking mouth shut. But I said it was a little surprising that she was putting on lotion in a towel with Josh in the room. She said she didn't even realize because she was just caught up in her story and went on autopilot. I've always known her to be a self conscious person - she wears swimsuits that cover a lot of her skin because she doesn't like to feel gawked at. So I was getting the tingles in the back of my brain that something was off. I said something like, ""You're usually so quick to cover up around people"" and she said, ""I guess I just know Josh so well that it didn't register."" When she said that, there was just something...abrasive? Annoyed? It came out more sharply than I would have expected. I should have dropped it but I was two glasses of wine in myself and said ""Whoa, did I strike a nerve?"" And she said ""Let's just go eat,"" but now clearly  agitated and doing a fake smile thing. At this point I could feel my stomach get a little queasy and like I was heading toward a world of pain.

I shut the door and said I could tell something was wrong. She said I needed to trust her, that there was nothing going on between she and Josh. I said I never imagined or implied that there was, so it was really weird that she felt like she had to make that clear. Now I was feeling gross and suspicious so I straight up said: ""I can tell you're uncomfortable right now, either you tell me what's up or I go ask Josh.""

What happened next was the most uncomfortable hour of my life. I need more scotch for this.

She said that she and Josh had a sexual history and that it really wasn't any of my business. I said that since he's still in our lives then I deserved to know the context. She said there was no context other than he was someone she felt safe with when she wasn't partnered, and they would have sex now and then. I asked when was the last time they slept together, and she danced around it before saying ""Before you and I were exclusive."" I said that was a fuzzy answer because I was exclusive with her from the time of our first date. She said that she never had sex with him after the two of us had sex. I asked if she had sex with him during the six months between our first date and when we had sex, and she said she had. I instantly felt like throwing up and started yelling a bunch of shit I don't really remember. She just had the most pissed off and disgusted look on her face the whole time. I finally calmed down a little and asked her to please give me the full story, timelines, etc.

She wasn't fully open and I had to keep digging to get more information, and it was a very non linear conversation, but here's what I pieced together.

About 10 years ago Suzanne's friend ""Rose"" (now 40F, also on this trip with us) had gotten out of a string of short disappointing relationships. Rose started having sex with Josh regularly in a FWB kind of way while still hitting the apps. Apparently the arrangement with Josh made it easier for her to forego sex in her dating life, which she found helpful for vetting guys to see if they were serious. Eventually she did find the man she is still married to, ""Eric"" (38M). Seeing the success that Rose had, two other friends got into the same arrangement with Josh and voila, they found serious guys as well. A modern fucking miracle! How about that! Suzanne said she talked to Josh about giving it a try and he was ""super good about boundaries"" and ""making sure the focus was on her finding a long term partner"" and even gave her advice about guys she was seeing. I said, ""So you would go on dates with me, I'd drop you off, give you a kiss on the cheek, you'd go fuck Josh, and then talk about our relationship?"" She said that was a crass way of putting it and that he was ""so supportive"" and made it easier for her and I to focus on ""what matters more.""

I stayed on the hide-a-bed and told people I was sick and couldn't ski today. I've just been sipping Macallan 12 and writing this in between naps. Feelings I'm having right now: Sadness, betrayal, jealousy, inferiority, drunk, more sad, and notes of pissed off and wanting to flee. But we are in fucking Canada and I don't even know the quickest way to get back home.

Do I try to work this out? Do I run? Do I even have a reason to be upset? The drunker I get the less angry I get and I can see her side of it more easily.

tl;dr Wife was banging her friend instead of me when we started dating, she claims because it helped her to not have sex too early in a relationship. We are on a ski trip with the friend and I want to run away from my life.

EDIT: I'm very hung over but reading through all the comments. To clarify a few things: 1). Only one other woman who has slept with Josh (Rose) is on the trip. The other two couples were my friends first and don't know Josh well. Sorry to those telling me I should drop a huge bombshell at dinner. 2). The reason it's hard to leave is because we all drove over the border together in a van, and we are deep in the mountains - not a lot of transit options. If I decide to leave it will be a massive pain in the ass. 3). I don't have any reason to suspect an ongoing thing between Josh and my wife. I've never seen a hint of flirtation from either of them. Even when I walked in on them last night they seemed completely casual, like I would be with one of my guy friends. But I also never suspected she could compartmentalize her feelings the way she apparently did so I think I need to be open to all possibilities at this point.

I'm going to go skiing this afternoon with just my buddy ""Ryan"" and see if he has any advice. And I will be abstaining from alcohol the rest of the trip as many suggested.

UPDATE 4/1: Thanks everyone for the wide array of perspectives on this, you've given me a lot to consider that I would not have otherwise. I particularly appreciate hearing women's points of view on this - the consensus from them seems to be that the arrangement with Josh made strategic sense but that Suzanne should have disclosed things much earlier. I went skiing yesterday and today after deciding that I'm going to stay the rest of the trip - I've been looking forward to this all year and we might actually get some snow soon. I've been hanging with two of my good guy friends for the most part. Suzanne has asked if we can talk but I told her I'm not ready and I just want to focus on skiing. I'm pretty sure she's alerted Josh because he has been standoffish. Whatever.  
  
The feeling that is currently strongest is one of broken trust. Several commenters noted that the language Suzanne used made her technically within her rights to have the arrangement with Josh. The question in my mind that I keep asking is: If I had known about Josh from the get-go, what would have changed? I certainly don't think I would have continued the relationship for six months without pursuing other options at the same time. Suzanne knew that I was only pursuing her, she had all of my attention because I wanted to make something work for once. I also can't shake the feeling that our relationship would have developed more quickly if Josh had not been around. I spent some time last night looking at old texts and emails from our early days, about three months in. I started crying because I remembered just how smitten I was with her by then - I was really starting to see a future with her. But now I read her responses differently - what seemed like cute coy replies feel like apathy in retrospect. It robs a lot of the magic from my memories, and I just feel empty.

I'm still not sure how I'm going to handle things, but I'm very seriously considering talking to Eric one on one before the trip ends to see what things look like from his experience. We're here until Thursday so there's time. Until then, I'm just going to ski my brains out and pray for snow.",1711842417.0,Street-Humor3599,relationship_advice
I (27M) don't want to hang out with my trans friend (25F) anymore. What do I do?,"This is a throwaway because my friend is also a Redditor.

A little backstory; I moved to a new country a little over an year ago. This was when I met my friend ""Kara"". We became pretty good friends very quickly and I appreciated the fact she was a friend in a new place where I knew no one. A year on from meeting her we've only gotten closer.

Kara is a trans-woman who had begun the process of transitioning almost a year before I met her, but she was still ""very new to the lifestyle"" (her words not mine) when I met her. Because of this a lot of the things we spoke about initially in our friendship were very centered around her transition and first steps into openly queer life. She admitted there weren't a lot of other people she could speak about this with and she enjoyed finally having someone hear her out, while I genuinely enjoyed learning about Kara's POV and experience as a trans woman. I also encouraged her to share other things with me such as her tastes in music, art and generally what she likes to do for fun (all of which are very queer). We often go to a lot of events together, we hung out at our city's pride festival and see each other a couple of times a month for drinks or general hanging out. I wanted to be someone she could celebrate herself and identity with and I think I accomplished that.

The problem is I think that identity dominates our friendship now.

When we hang out, Kara will insist on listening to her kind of music (lots of indie rock, queer artists and sapphic bands) a lot of which I don't really vibe with, but I never say no and don't complain when she does. However whenever I play my type of music (dad-rock, rap, afro-soul, rnb) she may listen to one or two songs before changing it to her music again claiming she ""wants to show me a new artist/song"".

I let her vent to me about her frustrations with work and her struggles in her romantic life. I even sat with her and let her cry on my shoulder when she broke up with her most recent partner, spending two hours consoling her. However when I try and speak to her about my frustrations she seems to get this glassy look in her eyes and she'll murmur a few affirmations before changing the topic to her experiences, because it reminds her of something she went through.

These are just a few of the many one-sided experiences I've had with Kara. I know she's a good person and I know it's unfair but I've started to resent her and her ""queer-ness"". As someone who's recently discovered and accepted my own bi/pansexuality, I understand how important someone's identity is to them, and I would never want to be someone who makes others shrink themselves to make myself feel seen or heard. But I've caught myself thinking things like ""enough with the trans talk"" or ""another lesbian indie band?"" recently.

I really hate that I feel this way. I don't want to hate who my friend is, or despise the things she likes, believes in and relates to.

How can I tell her this without her thinking I'm a giant transphobe and shunning her identity?

How can I fix this?

PS: While I appreciate all views and comments, I'd especially love the trans and queer people in this sub to weigh in as well.


EDIT:

So this post really blew up overnight and I can't thank everyone of you enough for taking the time to comment and share your thoughts and advice.

Thought I'd address a few things I've been seeing in the comments a lot.


- Is Kara neurodivergent?
Short answer: I don't know. She's told me before she's suspected she may be on the autism spectrum but has never tested for it. She is a little awkward naturally and has told me it's harder for her to make friends before, but I never really considered that had to do with her being neurodivergent (though it very well could be).


- Maybe Kara is trying to relate to me by talking about herself?
I'm 99% sure this is the case and is a big reason why I made this post. I felt guilty for having negative feelings resulting from (what I assume is) her trying to do a good thing.


- Have I ever voiced these feelings to her?
While I have said things like ""I don't really want to listen to this kind of music right now"" or ""I really want to talk about this"", she seems to hear me out initially before eventually (sooner rather than later) switching back to her kind of music or her kind of topic. But admittedly, I have never voiced how this reaction has upset me or made me feel before.


- I have ""people pleasing"" tendencies.
I agree. This is something I have struggled with for years. I've gotten better at it as I've gotten older, but I still carry a lot of trauma and fear of abandonment from some negative experiences resulting from me voicing my emotions and setting my boundaries, but it isn't an excuse.


I'm going to do what a lot of people are recommending and speak to her about how I've been feeling. I've realised my problem was never about her gender identity, queer-ness or lifestyle. In fact, even though I don't vibe with a lot of her music, I've discovered some artists and songs I really enjoy thanks to Kara. And her sharing her experiences has genuinely helped broaden my mind and thought processes about the world. I don't want her to stop sharing those things with me. My problem was feeling like my interests and emotions weren't ""heard"" or ""seen"" as much as hers. But it's not Kara's responsibility to sense and voice my feelings for me.

We'll be hanging out over the weekend so I'm going to try and bring it up to her then and hopefully it goes well (and maybe I'll even post an update after).

"I 28F am pregnant with our second baby, 28M husband wants me to abort and divorce me. Please help?","My husband and I have been married for almost two years, we have a 15 month old and we planned to have this second baby… our relationship has always been up and down, but recently when we were doing good we talked about having a second child close in age to our first and now I’m 10 weeks pregnant. 

About two weeks ago we got in a major argument which turned into him sleeping in a hotel every night and not coming home to see our son or talk to me.. his mom thinks I should get an abortion which I think has been part of his whole shift in not wanting this baby any more. Because he was really excited about it prior to her saying that.

He’s been so mean and avoidant and I just don’t know how to get through to him. I’ve already had two abortions prior to our marriage with him.

And on top of all this he wants a divorce or he wants me to sign a post nup.

I found out he’s in Vegas right now with his buddy and he told me he isn’t wearing his wedding ring, he’s been following random girls on Instagram.

It’s just too much. 

From the beginning I’ve been very excited to have this baby and really didn’t even consider an abortion until now that infidelity is in question… and just coming to realize how horrible he’s been.

I’ve been praying over him and our marriage everyday and it just seems like it gets worse and worse. I’m starting to question my faith honestly I just don’t know what to do. 


We’ve had one face to face conversation this entire time where we could talk about our feelings, but other than that he continues to stone wall me, gaslight me into thinking our friends and family don’t like me, gaslight me into thinking all of this is my fault, and is coercing me into an abortion and a divorce that I don’t want. 

Please help.

UPDATE - 7/8/24

My pregnancy - I went last Friday to have another ultrasound and the baby keeps measuring smaller, my due date keeps getting pushed back. So I’m trying to get ahold of my OB to make a more well rounded decision.. see what she thinks about the slow development. I would like to keep the baby still, but last night my husband texted me a frightening text that “Be fucking careful because your next husband might kill you with the games you play”. I just cannot even wrap my mind around that statement.

My marriage - He came to Palm Springs last weekend where I’m staying with my mom for the time being. He spent a few hours with our son and we were able to talk… it seems like he is just very embarrassed that all our friends and family know he’s been gone in hotels for weeks on end and he is definitely taking advantage of me trying to be nice and offer an olive branch. He sent me videos of him filling out divorce papers saying he was going for full custody, but I haven’t been served so who knows if he will actually go through with it.

Post Nup - He keeps saying the reason why he wants me to sign a post nup is because we have a commercial real estate brokerage that he founded in 2022, and I have been doing all the marketing for until I stepped away and became a SAHM.. I still do social here and there, helped him get marketing materials ordered and designed for a convention we had last spring, and we recently did a rebrand last winter that I took charge on.. I’ve supported him from the beginning and although I’m not the founding broker I do feel like I’ve been on this journey with him as a business partner and wife. This business is our livelihood. Our friends and family work for us. We have about 20 employees, and sold a quarter of a billion in total sales volume the first year and it’s essentially doubled or more every year.

He says he doesn’t want me to get half of the company because the company is “his” and he says even if we divorced now he would still take 100% of the company because California is a community property state and we would have to be married for 5 years at least for me to get half of the business in the divorce..

So I’m not sure honestly it seems like there’s something he isn’t telling me, because he only brings this post nup up when we are arguing and he’s threatening to divorce me.

"Found Out My (33f) Fiancé (31m) Used to Sleep with Married Women in His 20s, and His Justification Has Me Questioning Everything. How do I approach this?","Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/RtMnPiHb43

TLDR: my finance admitted to sleeping with married women in his twenties and that this is the reason why he’s such a good and attentive partner. I don’t know whether to believe him or whether this is a sign of what kind of person he is. 

Hi everyone, I’m feeling really confused and conflicted right now and could use some advice. Throwaway account because this feels very personal.

My fiancé (both in our early thirties) has always seemed like the perfect guy. He’s attentive, emotionally intelligent, and just… gets me. I’ve always felt so lucky to be with him, but recently, I stumbled upon something that has shaken me to my core.

We were having a deep conversation about our pasts, and the topic of past relationships came up. He admitted that in his twenties, he used to regularly sleep with married women. His reasoning? “They wanted it, and I never pursued women who were in happy marriages.” According to him, most of these women approached him, and he claimed that “90% of married women are willing to cheat if the opportunity presents itself.”

When I asked why he thought that, he told me it was based on his experience. He said some of these women cheated with him for extended periods before he got bored and ended it. It made me feel sick just listening to him describe it so casually.

But here’s the kicker: he admitted that one reason he’s such an amazing partner now is because, during those affairs, he kept a sort of mental list of all the things these women would complain about their husbands. He used that information to “be better.” He even joked that his “education” came from hearing what NOT to do in relationships.

When I pushed him on whether he felt any guilt or regret about helping destroy marriages, he brushed it off. He said these women were the ones who wanted to cheat, and he only gave them what they wanted. He even framed it like he was doing some kind of service, helping them realize their dissatisfaction.

He insists that I changed him, that I’m the reason he wants to settle down and leave all that behind. But I can’t shake the feeling that his past says something disturbing about his character. I know people grow and change, but I feel like I’ve been handed this big, ugly truth that I can’t unsee.

I don’t even know what I’m asking here.How can I talk to him about my feelings?

A threesome lead to the end of my (28F) first marriage. My new fiancé (29M) doesn’t know the whole story. How do I tell him?,"I got married to my high school boyfriend young, I was only 22 at the time. I would have liked to have waited longer but I got pregnant, so we got married. My ex was my first boyfriend, first kiss, first sex, first everything. And I was the same for him.

So about 3 years into our marriage my husband, now ex began to hint about spicing up our sex life as it had become rather dull. He suggested a threesome and I assumed he meant with another girl. I declined because I’m really not into girls but what he actually had in mind was another guy. Turns out one of his secret kinks was watching me with another man. I again declined, said I wasn’t interested but he was persistent and eventually wore me down. If I’m being honest I was a little curious having only been with one guy my whole life. So I agreed, we found a guy online and set the whole thing up. 

I won’t go into details on the whole event but I had the best sex of my life that night. My ex seemed to enjoy himself as well and meeting up with this guy, we will call him Tim, became a regular occurrence. Things were good for a while but turned bad in a hurry. My ex grew jealous of Tim and I began to question our relationship. Eventually my ex told me that we were done seeing Tim and when I said I didn’t want to, that was the beginning of the end for us. We tried to make it work for the sake of our daughter but we were broken at the point. 

We got divorced and I ended up dating Tim for a while but that ended when I realized we really weren’t compatible outside of the bedroom. 

Fast forward 3 years and I am engaged, we will call my fiancé Alex and I haven’t told him exactly what lead to my divorce. He knows I left my husband for another man. But I left out the rest of it. I’m ashamed of the whole thing and really don’t want Alex to see me that way. I really love my fiancé. I don’t think I knew what real love was until I met him. But I’m terrified of what he will think of me if he knows all of my past. 

I’m also not 100% certain my ex won’t let any of this slip out. The divorce wasn’t smooth and there have been many fights over custody. My ex is also pretty jealous of Alex as well. 

My ex has photos and video of me and Tim and I’m not sure he’s above sending it to Alex. He hasn’t yet but he has threatened it when we fight. 

I’m in a bind and need some advice. 

UPDATE: 
I can’t create a new post for some reason so I will update here. 

So I told my fiancé last night. Overall he took it well. But he did have a lot of uncomfortable questions that I really didn’t want to answer. But I decided that I was done lying and hiding the truth so I answered everything honestly. 

Alex had never really pressed me for a lot detail on what happened with my ex. I told him that I fell for another man I met and realized there was something wrong in my marriage. I told Alex that it was a mistake and I was ashamed of how I behaved and he just left it at that. So now he wanted the whole story and every detail. 

Alex was mostly interested in what I was thinking throughout the entire ordeal. He wanted to know what made me choose Tim and why he was the only one I ever slept with. The answer to that was that I wanted it to be just one guy at a time for safety. We both talked with Tim for a little while before we decided to go with him. We also ran a background check just to be certain the guy wasn’t a felon. As for why I chose Tim I didn’t lie and said it was purely physical attraction. Tim was tall and fit, just a great body from top to bottom. 

He asked what about Tim made our time together so good. I told him that it was really the taboo and the thrill that made it as good as I thought it was. I only learned that after I started dating Tim. The sex was still really good after we started officially dating but it wasn’t the mind blowing experience it was initially. 

Alex asked if I was completely over Tim and if we still had any contact. Me and Tim haven’t spoken in two years. After we broke up we continued to have sex every now and then. But when I met Alex I stopped it. Tim would text me early in our relationship, inviting me over for sex which I always declined. I blocked him after he sent me a pic of his (you know what) one night while I was sitting next to Alex. We haven’t had any contact since. 

Alex asked if my feelings changed for my ex because I had better sex with Tim but that wasn’t the case. The sex was bad with my ex because I was no longer attracted to him. I’m not sure I was ever very attracted to him actually. I was 15 when we met. He was older and gave me tons of compliments, told me how pretty I was. So we started dating and I liked having a boyfriend so we stayed together.  I eventually got pregnant so we got married. Tim just made me realize that I wasn’t very attracted to my ex. And I ultimately agreed to stop seeing Tim while we went to counseling but my ex just couldn’t get over that I wanted to keep seeing him. I admitted that I never really had good sex and was initially resistant to giving it up. I am ashamed of that. But agreeing to stop immediately wouldn’t have saved our marriage. My ex was very jealous by that point, obsessed really and we were already fighting a lot. The marriage was dead from the first time I had sex with another man. Probably before but definitely then. 

The whole ordeal really did destroy my ex and I feel terrible about that. My ex initially wanted full custody of my daughter but we settled on shared custody. But he eventually just stopped picking our daughter up. He became unstable and I now have full custody. My ex doesn’t see our daughter very much anymore. It’s really sad and although he isn’t blameless in all this, it is mostly my fault. I’m not that person anymore and I truly am ashamed of how I behaved. 

Finally Alex asked if I was satisfied with our sex life and if in the future if things grew stale would I want someone else. I told him that I am more than satisfied with our sex life. I’m obsessed with  Alex and insanely attracted to him. Now I’m sure at some point when we get older our sex life may get a little stale but there are ways to spice up your sex life without having sex with another guy. My experience with that has permanently soured me on that type of thing. 

Alex did have a problem with my ex having the videos of me and Tim but he doesn’t know what to do about it. He also has no desire to see them so I’m relieved about that too. 

So we are ok and I just want to tell anyone that is considering something like this with their partner to really think it through before you got through with it. I learned that the hard way.",1729102678.0,ThrowRA83659,relationship_advice
My 31F Husband 31M does not want my father in the delivery room because he is a man. Is there anyway this isn’t a form of possessive behaviour manifesting?,"Update:
Wow this got a lot more attention than I was expecting.

I will give husband update first then talk about the direction of the comments.

I spoke to my husband. He didn’t want to deep dive into the “why” at first . He said it is my choice at the end of the day but he isn’t happy. 
I insisted on understanding why and I asked if it is because I would be exposed. He said and I quote “ what, why would I care about that, the man changed your diapers”.
He was worried about not being the primary person after me making decisions and helping to look after me if my dad is there.
I explained the dynamic and that the role other family members play is to make sure we have back up if needed and that when the baby comes we have people we trust with me / baby.
We are good now but are talking about how to improve communication for gut reactions.

Comments

I will say that from the comments this might be a family dynamic thing. I hadn’t really thought about being exposed in front of my dad because I can’t imagine my dad ever sexualising me. It just isn’t something that he would or could ever do so it’s not on my radar like that.

I know everyone’s family is different and some families have stricter gender roles for what is and isn’t ok but I think that’s just a family by family choice.

Also when I think of family members in the room they are in a support role on the north end of business regardless of gender I don’t think any family member is going to be deliberately looking down there.

Thank you everyone for your comments.

I know some people thought I was weird but I appreciate those comments too as they helped broaden my thoughts on what the problem could be.
Also thanks to everyone who reminded me that it is my choice.


TL;DR my 31F husband 31M does not want my father in the delivery room because he does not want another man in the room.
He has acknowledged that he does not understand the reaction himself but it sure it is wrong for another man to be in the room. I can not think of another reason other than territorial nonsense.

I 30F have been married to my husband 31M for a year but we dated for 9 years before getting married.

The conversation we had kinda raised a red flag for me but I also know there is some trauma around this topic for me so want some outside perspective.

We have  started to talk about having kids. I was talking about how funny it would be seeing how my mum reacts during delivery compared to my dad. My husband without missing a beat said “ I will not have another man in the delivery room “.
This is super weird because he has never said anything that weird and territorial. We laugh at the “alpha male “ guys  in videos together.
He has acknowledged that he does not know why he reacted like that but still really doesn’t want my dad there.

This is important to me because my family has a bad baby delivery history, normally to do with bad midwives. My mother almost died giving birth to me because the midwife pulled the placenta out causing internal bleeding as she also didn’t check it was complete.

My sister had a lot of issues also caused by her midwife. My sister is one of the strongest people I know with a very high pain tolerance, I will never forget how she sounded when she called our mum…. 
My cousin is an only child because my aunt also had issues caused by a midwife.

This has me concerned for my own future births.  I want my husband as my birth partner but want at least 1 other family member in at a time to advocate as needed.

I understand that my family dynamic is a bit different we don’t really do traditional gender roles. My dad was closer to home than my mum growing up. He cooked special meals using cast iron pans when the women in our family were on that time of the month and made sure our hot water bottles got swapped out before they got cold. Magically made our favourite snacks appear etc…

Is it weird that I want my father included in my delivery room support team?

Any ideas what could be triggering my husband or perspective I may be missing from someone who gets his point?",1729037293.0,Beginning-Resist-416,relationship_advice
My gf (F35) makes much more than me (M39) and it’s causing division. What to do?,"My gf (F35) makes \~600k substantially more than me (M39) at \~85k / year. 

Posting from a throwaway... 

She’s in a career where you need a masters. My career is in a good sector with growth potential, but hard to match hers unless I also get a masters. I work two jobs and both are at non-profits. So the pay is less than the for-profit side. She didn't pay for school so no debt or loans. We both have a lot of savings.

**Background**

She wants to keep financials separate when we get married. I get people will keep money earned before marriage separate and inheritance separate, but I always thought money earned ***during*** marriage is joint and that marriage is coming together of everything. That’s how I was brought up and my expectations. However, I'm willing to go along with her wishes. And set up a joint account. But even know before marriage it's frustrating and I'm not sure if I want to live my life like that. She is frugal to the point of it being a character defect. I am more relaxed and of the mindset that money comes and money goes - enjoy life.  I think that if I have to put in 100% if my income to a joint account it's unfair for her to get to put in 20% and save the rest. I said if I make more (or if we switched places) I'd contribute more but she says that is easy to say and it wouldn't be true if it actually happened (whatever that means).

**The situation**

Normally when joint income is so high it’s a blessing (I would think), but it’s causing a lot of friction and resentments.

Here are some examples - I hope these examples help explain the situation since I have had such a hard time writing this post.

* I want 2 kids and she says I don’t make enough for 1 kid and that I can’t afford to live let alone raise a child. She keeps referring to it as being able to afford my kid vs our hypothetical kid. 

* I save maybe 20% of my income and some months I break even, but I still am told I shouldn’t go to Chipotle for lunch or even use too many paper towels because they are expensive. She also gets really mad when I tip (she puts in $1.00 for a taxi and I put in 15%. I used to work for tips as a summer job so it's important. 

* She is so **VERY against the man making less** that she wants to split everything 50/50 so what I put in she puts in - not a penny more as a way to hammer home this feeling.

* She keeps saying I need to look for higher paying jobs. And I should apply to 100s a day like the house is on fire. I do apply just as I have time. I have a weekday job at a nonprofit as well as a weekend job. My therapist say I have quality, respectful employment and I should be proud of what I do. Plus I work TWO jobs so I’m not sitting around being lazy.  She said the man should be the provider.

* she wants to buy the house so it’s in her name and not both our names and I pay the taxes. (But in this scenario I’m not building any equity). When I suggest splitting the mortgage 50/50 and both being on the deed she says she wants to buy a 1mm house out of my price range (which is 700k). When I bring up the 700k house she says she refuses to live in a “poor area” so then the only option is to each own different percentage of the house 60/40 and I pay 40% of the mortgage and she pays 60%. But she says that isn’t fair to her because she is taking “**MORE risk**” but I said you also get more of the upside by owning 60% (or whatever the split ends up being) when we sell it. It's like you invest more in the asset and you get more ROI when we sell. So the house thing is a standoff.

**The Root of the Problem**  
  
The income difference is a real point of resentment for her and she uses terms like ‘I refuse to be the breadwinner’ etc. I said that couples I know, where both partners work it is never the same income. Unless you have the same job at the same company with the same benefits it will be different. For example, my job puts 10% of my salary into a 4013b and I have great insurance. Her job makes a lot more but benefits are less.

I feel emasculated and worthless and like my jobs don’t matter. There is MORE to marriage than money. Who cooks, who takes care of the kids who does other stuff around the house? How can a marriage be defined by the take home pay. I know people who are miserable and work all the time and it’s toxic. But perhaps, to her point, I am not making enough in this world of high cost of living. We also live in a high cost blue state. I should make more and I am applying to 125k pay range jobs, but happy to do it slowly and not rush out of a job I like.

**Some other context**  
  
She also thinks she is poor and her parents (while very well off and have 10+ million) are the same way. They will take all the napkins and plastic forks from a restaurant or all the sugar packets from a diner. Or if there is cream and half and half bring cups and take it all. Just to save money on sugar, napkins and stuff.

There’s being intentional on spending and cost conscious but also frugal to the point of concern. People can exist at both ends of the spectrum. I feel like they think they are poor like anorexic people think they are fat.

I want to have kids and figure out the cost as we go. I mean college isn't for 20 years.

Should I adapt to her ultra frugality and try to make more money or is this relationship something that isn't going to work due to the income difference? Like I said I thought it would be a blessing if joint income is so high. Instead it is just a cluster of fighting, anger and resentments on all sides.

We are seeing a couple therapist for the first time today so any advice on what to bring up? Is this all a control thing? Thank you for any advice!

"I (33M) accidentally found messages between my fiance (30F) and her friend that make it look like they're planning to have sex when they meet up in a few months. What do I do? 
","I've been with my partner for over 10 years, we've always been very happy together, never any real issues. We live alone in our own house, and we're both avid gamers, with PC desk setups in a corner of our living room each. For the last year+ she's been working night shifts, so when she's off work she's up all night on her PC while I'm asleep. 

She has one particular friend she made online a year or two ago, a male friend from elsewhere in the country she met via an online game. Now I've never had any issue with her having male friends, far from it, I've always felt very secure - even when she told me a while ago that her group of friends, including this guy, frequently have quite ""smutty"" discussions, talk about their sexual preferences, fantasise about fictional characters, etc etc - not an issue for me at all, it's all discussions, chatting, venting, etc.

More recently I've noticed her referring to this online friend in new ways, using Japanese words like ""anata"" (my dear etc), or ""onii-chan"" (big brother) - we both enjoy anime and have made vague attempts at learning the language in the past so I know what these mean of course, and I know she has a particular liking for hentai, or pornagraphic comics/animation. It caught me off guard at first, but told myself it wasn't an issue, we're still happy together and she's still as affectionate as the day we got together with me.

One last background bit of note, over the last couple of months she's been planning a weekend trip later this year, just her, her mum and her sister - they're going to where this online friend lives, and she's going to meet him in person for the first time while they're there. She discussed this with me beforehand, and knowing they were good friends and not having any concerns at all, I said I was fine with it - she doesn't get to see her mum and sister very often as they live a fair distance from us, whereas we live quite close to my mum so I see her fairly often, so I understand wanting some time just with them, as well as taking an oppurtunity to meet a friend.

Background out of the way, to the reason I'm concerned, last night - it was a fairly normal night at home, she wasn't working so we're both in the living room, playing our games at our desks, having snacks, etc. While she's in the bathroom, I get up to take a few dishes through to the kitchen, and as I always do, go to her desk to get her dishes too - which is when I noticed her messages to her friend open on her screen, on some pretty intense erotic roleplay. I wasn't expecting to see that she was doing this while I was in the room, and for the first time I got a little concerned, which led to me sitting down and scrolling back through their messages - and earlier that same night, they had been discussing fantasies about what to do when they met up. Things like him asking if another friend of his could come along, and her replying ""I want onii-chan all to myself"". His response was along the lines of ""Oh? And what would you do when you get me all alone"" and then they got into, what I think is pretty hard to misunderstand, graphic detail - ""i want to snuggle up and cuddle, in a way open to more possibilities"". ""if my wandering hand found a tent, i'd keep wandering"". it went on in this kinda of vein, eventually getting quite explicit about what she likes and what she wants to do to him, before she then said they should stop as ""its a shame he's not gone to bed yet"". This being just before she went to the bathroom and i came over to her desk.

So now I'm sitting here in the daytime while she's asleep, a bit shaken up and unsure what to think or do. I know I shouldn't have scrolled back through her private messages but the fact she was talking about this with him while I was right there has really upset me. I wasn't aware she was in any way unsatisfied - hell even last night, the same night, earlier on she was her usual playful self, coming up to me demanding cuddles, kisses, general affection etc. But if I confront her about it she could, quite justifiably, say I was invading privacy by reading the messages, despite what she was doing in them... my feeling bad about reading it is conflicting with my need to ask her what the fuck is going on. 

That rambled on a bit longer than I intended, I'm still pretty riled up, thank you for reading anyone who read it all. ",1721814014.0,ThrowRA5649123,relationship_advice
Husband (36M) wants me (35F) to abort an unplanned pregnancy. We have a wonderful toddler. I don't know what to do.,"A throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years. We have a wonderful 3 year old, let's call him Bowen, who is a lot of work, but whom we both love to death. It was a planned and very much wanted pregnancy, and my husband is a very involved dad. He doesn't want more children though due to the amount of work and stress it brings. I would love to have another, but I respect his stance and have been on hormonal birth control since Bowen was born.

Fast forward to a few days ago when I started feeling constantly nauseous and took a pregnancy test just in case. Positive. I freaked out - not knowing that I was even pregnant, not knowing how my husband would react, not knowing if everything would work out. My husband took the news more calmly. He considered it for a day or two and finally said that while he feels sad and guilty about it, he can't do it (manage two kids) and wants me to abort the baby, as that's the best choice for our family. He thinks that one vote for abortion should mean abortion. I'm very much pro choice, but I feel like I don't really get to choose. I fully agree that our toddler needs two happy parents more than he needs a sibling, and it's unfair to bring a baby into this world if they're unwanted by one of the parents. But we're not discussing a hypothetical baby anymore. The baby is already here, and it wasn't my choice either. I know that continuing the pregnancy against my husband's wishes could destroy our relationship and make our lives much more difficult. As a mom, I also know that I need to do what's best for my kids, not what might be best for me. But I don't know how I can possibly go though the trauma of an unwanted abortion and then be a happy mom to our 3 year old and a good partner. How I can see my baby move on the screen (they always do an ultrasound before abortions here), just like Bowen did, and then take the pills. How I can live with this for the rest of my life, likely not being able to tell anyone in real life, and always wondering what could have been. I don't think that my husband's worst case scenario is very likely, but how can I roll the dice if he isn't on board?

Our local abortion clinic offers free counselling and we have booked an appointment for next week. I acknowledge that this is one of the toughest situations a couple can be put in, so it's not surprising that we haven't been able to come to a mutual decision on our own, or even to understand our own feelings. I hope that counselling will help us think through the choices (or help me accept the choice, as it looks now). But if any of you has been in a similar situation, either as the mother or father, and can share some advice or perspective, I would be grateful to read it. I will show this thread to my husband too.

\#TLDR: I got pregnant due to birth control failure, husband wants an abortion, I don't think I can do this, but I feel I must for the sake of our family. Words of advice appreciated.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for your comments, I didn't expect this much feedback. While I tried to describe my husband's reasons not to have another child (and the fact that I agree with most of them) well, I realize that I made him seem irresponsible and selfish, which was not my intention. Firstly, with the ""one vote for abortion should mean abortion"" he didn't mean that I don't get to decide, but rather that this would not be a good decision for our family (and the baby) if he is not on board. I regretted having written it this way the moment I saw the first comments - but I was away from my laptop and couldn't edit it. Regarding his reasons not to have another child, he simply didn't think he can survive the baby phase, cope with the workload and be a good parent to two kids. And now he doesn't want to take the risk of screwing the child's life. I fully understand that and have similar worries (except for worrying if he would be a good dad), but I simply cannot bring myself to accept the alternative (termination). He thought that he might, just maybe, feel ready to try for another once our toddler gets older, which is the reason he didn't get a vasectomy so many of you mentioned (and which he obviously regrets now). Both of us assumed that if birth control didn't fail for several years, it would never fail.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Once again thanks for all the comments, especially from those who have been in our situation - hearing your stories was my main motivation to write this post in the first place. Most of these stories were not as black and white as many commenters without such first-hand experience predicted (basically divorce either way), especially in situations where it was a long term relationship or at least both partners were open to communication.

My husband had a change of heart and agreed to keep the pregnancy. He is still very stressed and worried (so am I), but we'll take some steps to hopefully make things manageable. We still kept the appointment with a counsellor and it was good to feel heard; we also got a contact number to a local family counsellor if we ever need support in the future. We have many months to prepare, we'll make it work!",1692440272.0,Sensitive-Option314,relationship_advice
Husband (34M) says he regrets marrying me (32F) due to my lack of physical activity: where do we go from here?,"Hey everyone, I'm 32F married to 34M. We've been married 4 years and have a beautiful 2 year old 2M.

For our whole relationship, my level of physical activity has been a problem topic. My husband is very physically active. He used to play soccer (had to stop due to an injury), walks, bikes, hikes, etc. When we met, I also was reasonably physically active, but doing totally different activities (yoga, dance). We got married during COVID and I got pregnant relatively quickly. During pregnancy and since we’ve had our baby (now active, running-around-all-the-time toddler) I admit my physical activity has dropped to just functional things like childcare and walking around and running after our kid. I’ve done the odd dance workshop but am definitely not doing any regular scheduled exercise each week. I am of average weight (BMI in normal range) and am net 8 pounds heavier than I was when my husband and I met. In the 4 years we’ve been married, besides pregnancy and postpartum, I’ve also had another minor abdominal surgery. 

Every few months, my husband and I will have a conversation in which he expresses that he’s quite upset that my level of physical activity is so low, and that he wishes we were doing more active things together. Specifically, he’d love to hike more together. Hiking has never been an activity I’ve enjoyed — and since we’ve been married my husband hasn’t been hiking much either although he used to do a lot more of it before. 

A couple weeks ago, we had this conversation again, and he said if he’d known this is where we’d be 4 years after marriage, and if he’d known this would be my baseline level of physical activity, he would have reconsidered getting married (our sex life has been dead postpartum, and I think it’s due to this). My reaction was that (1) I am healthy and normal, and not on track for any kind of adverse outcome due to my health, (2) we have a good relationship other than this one point: he’s a great and involved dad, we live in a beautiful place in a house we love, and I bring a lot to the table (make as much if not more $ than him, am a great mom, am loving and caring and kind to him). 

His reaction was that being of average health isn’t enough — his expectation in a partner is that they be of above-average health and activity, and he’s not willing to reconsider that, but he does want to work on our marriage and relationship. For my part, I agree that I used to do more when we met, but it doesn’t seem right that there’s no allowance for the fact that in the 4 years we’ve been married, it’s been COVID, pregnancy, postpartum, and another surgery for me. I do wish I was more physically active but I don’t know if I’ll meet my husband’s standards even if I tried. 

Our marriage feels like it’s on the rocks, and my self esteem is really low at this point. Where do we go from here?",1717333053.0,ThrowRAphys_activity,relationship_advice
My (24F) boyfriend (29M) had  s*x with me while blacked out. What should I do? What do I feel? ,"We’re traveling with my boyfriend (29M) his brother and his partner. We went on a cruise and got extremely drunk. I have a good tolerance generally but yesterday for the first time I blacked out. 

I don’t remember how I got to my cabin and I woke up naked. Didn’t think too much about it because I had to rush and leave the boat that had arrived at our destination. My boyfriend was sleeping in the twin bed next to me. 

We start driving down and at lunch we have a moment alone and he tells me he fucked me while I was unconscious. He came in me and didn’t clean up afterwards. He starts laughing as if it was a really funny joke and I nervously giggle not knowing how to react. 

He says to me: “You like it right?”  

At this point I’m realizing I feel disgusted and dirty. I had realized I was wet during the day and didn’t understand why. When he sees that my reaction isn’t positive he gets mad. He expects me to find it funny. When I ask for space he gets annoyed. 

For the rest of the day I’m holding back tears and he’s started to realize he fucked up. I’m still so hungover and the group situation means I’m putting up an act as if everything’s okay. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel stuck. I lost my credit card yesterday too. 

He has had sex with me before while I was sleeping. I have consented to this and also I can stop him if I want to if it happens. But this feels so different. I couldn’t say no and I hate the fact that he came inside of me and didn’t clean up. I feel like so disrespected, mostly too because of how he expects me to find it funny. 

The time difference with my home country means I can’t talk to anybody. I’m at a loss on how to process this. Any advice is welcome. Thank you for reading. 

Edit: I just want to clear some things up

1. I have an IUD so I’m not worried about that aspect. 
2. When he initiates while I’m sleeping I always woke up and either continue or ask him to stop. 
3. Besides being blacked out I was told I was found sleeping on the floor. They could not wake me up despite trying to. 
4. My credit card appeared. It was in his Jean pocket. I genuinely don’t think he was hiding it from me he simply forgot. I usually give him my valuables when we go out because he has better pockets. 
5. Im now at the grandmothers house. I feel safe. Haven’t talked much yet. I will start looking for flights now with my card. 

Thank you for the overwhelming support. I’m very grateful for being able to vent when I didn’t have anybody. ",1725295025.0,Standard_Cat8726,relationship_advice
Update to- My(41f) husband(52m) has a second family on the side,"Firstly, thank you all for your kindness and for all the great advice you’ve given me. I am truly grateful! The past couple weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions. I have been able to engage the services of a great divorce lawyer and I was advised to not let my husband know that I knew of his affair. 

I was then finally given the go ahead a few days ago, and well at first he refused to admit to anything, but I was prepared for that and I showed him all the online posts his mistress made. I also showed him pictures taken by my investigator. He still denied it. Then accused me of being insane. Then after hours of me just throwing evidence after evidence at him, he finally admitted to the affair. He tried to twist things so that he could weasel and lie his way out of it but I was relentless. I did not let him twist reality and make me doubt the plain truth. We argued all day and all night, it was exhausting. The next morning he tried to get on my good side because I woke up to him having made breakfast and he was begging me to not hate him and to find it in my heart to forgive. I told him I could not and that I wanted a divorce. That brought on the waterworks and he called me a heartless and a unforgiving bitch. He then left to take his things to his parents house as I had asked him to leave. 

While he was at his parents I went to his mistress’s home. My sister went with me (she waited in the car) and well she let me in and we talked. She wasn’t even surprised I was there (I had already suspected she was aware of him being a married man but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt). She was actually gloating when she told me about how in love he is with her, how good he is to her boys and how he bought her the house, the car and all the other money he spent on her. She then told me if I wasn’t such a lazy bitch and gold digger he wouldn’t have been so easily taken and how my lack of submission and servitude was the reason he cheated (how am I a lazy bitch when I’m the primary parent and homemaker is beyond me and how am I a golddigger I don’t understand as I work and earn more than him). As she was flapping her gums, he arrived and he was pissed off at her. (he was calling me a ton and I had texted him that I was at the mistress’s house) They argued as he told her not to speak to me like that and he in no uncertain terms told her that he wants to be with me, that she’s ruining his chance at saving his marriage. I just thanked her for being forthcoming and continued to laugh my way out of the house because yes my husband makes great money but as his business partner I own half of his business and as his wife I own half of all his other asset’s. So I am glad that she gloated and that she confirmed that he paid for most of what she has. Now I know for certain that he nor she deserve an ounce of my sympathy, and I will take back everything he ever gave her, and much more!",1693263719.0,Throwra-brokenwife,relationship_advice
My (36M) husband says I’m ableist against his autism. Am (25F) I ableist?,"So for background my husband, I’ll call Danny, has autism. He’s not far on the spectrum but generally in the middle. My older brother was high on the spectrum so I know how to deal with people with autism well to a degree.

A thing about my husband is he’s picky. I mean, REALLY, picky! If even a bit of cheese or something drops the tiniest bit on another part of his food he’ll refuse to eat. He can get aggressive quickly and will throw, and kick whatever he can in sight! But he’ll sob afterwards and apologise to me as much as he can.

Everything happened last night. I was cooking spaghetti bolognese, my finest dish lol, Danny has these special plates toddlers have where they are silicone with little dividers in a circle. Because it’s toddler-sized he has two so it’s a more adult portion. 

I put the spaghetti, garlic bread and bolognaise down and passed him his plates. I turn to dish my food up when I hear this-
“Thanks, babe! …. Wait. I can’t eat this. You know I can’t. Why?” 

I’m really confused. I thought I did everything right but realised a bit of chunk of tomato fell from one part of the plate and went onto the garlic bread. I’m kicking myself at this point internally because now I know he won’t eat. I then realised!
“Oh sorry! Why don’t you eat the second plate and I’ll split my food with you-“

Danny gets up and slams the plate on the floor and I hear a splat and a rubber squelch noise. I turn and both plates are on the floor and he has a grin on his face.
“Make it again. You know it pisses me off. Do I need to remind you I’m autistic?”
I looked pissed. At that moment I felt my blood rushing. He sounded like a cartoon villain and was smiling the entire time! 

I’m annoyed so I just shout at him-“Why are you fucking smiling?? Your autism is more like an asshole-ism! I’m not your maid! You can at least help!”

I never swear! Ever! I work with children so even I was surprised with myself. Danny looked taken aback and flipped me off and just called me an “Ableist little bitch” and stormed off to our room and locked the door.

I flinch a bit and get more annoyed looking at that mess. I just leave it. I get my food turn off the stove and just eat on the couch and fall asleep on it.

I woke up the next day with him gone and a text saying “You need to be more open mind to my disability and realise the world doesn’t revolve around you. I hope this can be fixed when I’m home later.” 

I called in sick to work today so all I’ve down is clean, read and take a shower. I’m reassessing my whole relationship and maybe I am just a jerk. He does have autism so he probably can’t help it so I feel even more worse. 

Am I ableist? I feel so horrible about all this and I don’t know how to apologise or reconsider everything with him!

UPDATE! (I’ll keep it long since I’m 90% sure I can only do 1 update.)

So, first off. Hello!
I just wanna say thank you. I didn’t expect my post to get this much attention but everybody here has been beyond sweet to me and I can’t thank anybody enough! I’d love to reply but I’m not the best at replying and I get too worried if I’m rude or my tone off.
I’ll answer some questions but I’m sorry, Reddit’s a bit new to me!

People have private messaged me asking if I’m okay and checking up on me. I’m about too shy to respond but I’m doing a lot better! Anybody who’s tried checking in on me, thank you so much! I’m so much happier and making this post is somewhat clearing my head in a way.
(And to the comments writer out by the age gap it was kinda on me because I like older guys, when we met he thought I was around the same age as him 😅)

Anywho! To the main of what is going on right now. I read as many comments as I could and if my mind was a fan shits all over it! I’ve thought back to our whole relationship and I’m so blind! I know I’ve not had many partners before Danny so I kinda thought this was normal..?

So basically after reading them all I went to my eldest brother (Eli) and explained what was going on. Currently, he let me stay at his house so I’ve just been helping with my nieces and I called sick to work. I own my house and Danny kinda lives with me? The house is small and he stays Wednesday-Sunday and the rest with his mum to help her out. 

So Eli went to my house and packed up all of Danny's things while I worked on filing for divorce. Danny called me in the afternoon screaming down the phone that I was abusing him and this was disgusting. I had it on speaker and my sister-in-law chewed his ass out! 

I know it’s nothing major but after everything today and being scared I'm planning on calling a locksmith to change my house locks and I’m changing my emergency contact to my siblings.

My brother has been so nice to me this past day and I can’t thank him enough. His wife Linda is a dream and we’ve spent the day playing with their twin girls. 

As a lot of people have said he’s probably abusive I have had that fear to after reading the comments so any conversation is through his cousin (I and his cousin were childhood best friends) right now all she’s told me is that he’s been at his mum's screaming and crying to anybody who’ll listen!

And in case you find this post and you know who you are Danny. Fuck off and good riddance!",1717444492.0,ThrowRA_Kittykay,relationship_advice
Am I shallow for being disappointed my (28F) date (30M) showed up to our first date wearing sweats & a t shirt? ,"I feel like I’m losing my mind about this 😅 This guy emphasized looking for a serious, life partner. He’s been super thoughtful. Planned the date, picked me up. I open the door and was so disappointed :/ I was in a dress all adorable and put a lot of thoughtfulness to make sure I looked good. I couldn’t shake it and felt bummed out the entire date. 

Am I crazy that this bothered me? It was just mini golf but in my mind, first few dates you’re dressing to impress and not necessarily wearing your regular every day attire. I tried to share this w/ him and he said I was shallow, never wants to see me again and good luck because he’s sure I’ll get many future complaints.. 🤡 He interpreted this as me not accepting him for who he is..  but I feel like if you can wear it to bed it’s not something you wear on a first date!!

My (34m) wife (33f) cheated and is now pregnant.,"Long story short, my (34m) wife Anna (33f) cheated on me. I don't know why. She says she doesn't know why either. 

Anytime I ask anything, it's just a river of tears. She says sorry and begs me to forgive her and forget it but I can't. 

But leaving hasn't been easy either. We have 2 boys together. She's my high school sweetheart. Our families are longtime friends and are still tight with each other. 

They've all urged me to stay for the kids. To forgive her since it was ""one time"". To not give up all the good because of one bad. 

But the worst part is she's pregnant. 

I found out about the pregnancy from my mother as I had her blocked and wasn't living in the same house anymore. 

I demanded a paternity test. She readily agreed and swore she'd get rid of the child if it's not mine. She's had nothing but curse words for her affair partner. But then, all she's done since getting caught (didn't confess) is curse the guy and herself and cry. 

She's threatened to end herself. All she does is hug the boys and cry. 

I'm waiting on the results. I'll divorce her anyway but she says the baby is for sure mine. That she slept with him once whereas we'd been intimate pretty much every night the duration of her affair. It lasted 2 months I think. They met, talked and slept only once if I'm to believe her. 

I don't know why, but the idea of the child being mine disgusts me. It feels like she couldn't commit to anything. Not to me nor the other guy. Why was she cheating if I was satisfying her? How is it that she wanted to talk about her feelings with some random man but not me? How was she sharing her deepest thoughts and feelings with this guy and being with me at once? How does that even work? 

I've always thought cheating was because you werent being fulfilled by your partner at home. I've read all these stories of wives leaving their kids, denying affections to their husbands, making jokes at the husband's expense, ruining the men financially etc. She's done nothing of that sort. She's still the best mother I could have hoped for my sons. They love her more than they love me I know. She was still the same loving and giving woman I fell for while she was being with the other guy. I saw her texts (the ones she hadn't deleted) and every other text is ""I love my husband"". 

I don't understand. I can't make heads or tails of this situation. If I did give her a baby, am I expected to forget and move back in? What if I can't do that? It's easy hating the child now because that might be her AP's. But what if its mine and I still hate it? 

I genuinely don't know how to be without her. Our entire lives are interwoven. Some days I want to go back to the blissful ignorance I was living in. 

The DNA report takes a week I believe. It's been 3 days. 

My sister (she visits Anna regularly. I'm angry about that too because she's only visited me twice.) says my wife just looks at our wedding photos and cries. We have a whole junkyard collection worth of pictures and memories. She begged me to go see her once. 

I am clueless of how to proceed. It would've been so much easier if she had been a horrible woman for those 2 months that I could begin to look back and hate. But I cant. Life had been as normal and sweet as ever. I don't even have a bad memory of her I can use to hate her. Our last big fight before this, I can't even remember.

I'm going to see her and my boys tomorrow. I think I'll ask for DNA tests on them too. I know they're mine. But you never know. Maybe I'll do it just to hurt her. Maybe I'll find something and I'll just  hurt myself more. But that feels so unfair to the boys.

Just how do I make sense of this?

Edit: I called her. She was crying again but agreed to meet with me. I told her I was going with divorce one way or another. But whether we can ever reconcile a few years later or not fully depends on her honesty. She was crying and her voice sounded rough. But after a while she said she will tell me everything. (So she does know why she did it?) 

But for some reason, she asked me to bring my sister along. My sister hasn't said anything either. I'm only praying my sister doesn't turn out to be an accomplice or something. 

She didn't beg for forgiveness or say ""think about our kids"" after I told her how manipulative she's sounding. She seemed genuinely shocked to realize how she was holding me hostage with her threats. Does that mean something deeper? Are they actions of someone who has remorse? 

Edit: I talked to her. She showed me all the evidence and I found out which the man was. I am certain now that she was infact assaulted. However Anna doesn't seem to think so. 

She says she didn't fight back and had ""goaded"" him which made him attack her.

I cannot update because reddit is being strange. I have decided to put everything on hold for now. And just take her counseling. Nothing else until I get the paternity results on the baby.

I (m 26) am struggling with partner’s ( 34f) inheritance. Can you please help me get over my sense of entitlement?,"Hi all. My head is kind of spinning and I was hoping to get an outside perspective on financial situations within my relationship.

My partner and I have been together five years and make roughly the same amount of money a year. She purchased a home in February of 2022 after being gifted 100k from her father as the down payment.  The home was a bit more pricy than was realistic for our finances, but as she was the one making the purchase, I didn’t have that much input on final say. That said, we split monthly payment for mortgage + bills, which is honestly more than I’d want to spend each month. Since we have moved in, I’ve invested over 7k of my own money; new washer and dryer, a new fridge, and half of the cost of the AC installation. She recently agreed to deduct $100 off of my rent for two years to equal the cost of the fridge. This agreement came after she dumped me for a week before we eventually got back together after seeing a couples therapist, which is another long story.

We recently both accumulated quite a bit of credit card debt. Mine mostly due to the aforementioned appliances and hers due to cancer treatment for her cat. We frequently would discuss our stresses over finances and our plans to get back on track. Three days ago, she found out she is inheriting close to 200k from the passing of a relative. While at the funeral for said relative, her father assured her of her inheritance of him which will be a few million. I feel so guilty to admit that the moment she shared this, I felt kind of deflated. She shared of excitement to be debt free and the investments she wants to make and the trips she wants to go on. She is now on this “environmental kick” where she only wants to purchase sustainable and thus more expensive items, with the implication being I pay for half. Today, as I was discussing finance stressors as I talked about our plans for family gifts, she looked at me and said, “it’s okay, I have debt too!” Then back tracked after realizing what she said. 

We have always had a challenging time with finances. Last Christmas, I spent a stupid amount to get her a dream gift and she didn’t get me anything until nearly two months later. She eventually got me a nice jacket which I love to this day. I think what hurt was just her total lack of effort. Had she made me a card or painted me a picture or anything, it would’ve been different. But she just didn’t. I feel a lot of hurt of the routine in our relationship, both financially and otherwise. 

I have only focused on the negative aspects but I do love her and we do have a lot of fun together when we are in a good groove. I’m just really struggling with her new inheritance. I come from poor parents but my mother always goes above and beyond for her on holidays while her father barely acknowledges me and instead gives her a lump sum that she never shares. I feel angry with myself and my sense of entitlement. I just want you Reddit folks to help humble me with outside perspective and to help me get my head out of my own butt over this inheritance.

Thanks for listening to my rambles!

Wow! Okay, I did not expect this much feedback. I apologize for the delay in posting an “update” of sorts. I honestly have felt kind of overwhelmed by the sheer number of y’all! 

I just wanna start out by thanking you all for taking the time to read and respond. I really appreciate it. Trust me, I have read and mulled over every comment, lol. My poor mother is probably tired of me calling her.

I also want to state that I don’t believe my partner is a bad person or being malicious. I think she is just showing the behaviors she was taught in life. I have no doubt that she loves and cares me in the ways she knows how to/the ways she was taught as a child by her parents. She really is a good person. She tends to immediately go to self-preservation, hence the lack of financial consideration but when I share my perspective, she often comes around. I guess I just feel uncomfortable asking for payback on what I have invested. I also want to state that I am a very sensitive person, perhaps to a fault, lol. And that there is more nuance than I could probably capture with a single post on Reddit while using my silly phone!

Thankfully I do have an individual therapist and really supportive family/friend group, in addition to our couples therapist. I plan to work on setting more strict financial boundaries in couples therapy this upcoming week. But your comments have certainly shifted my thought process in terms of what I want long term. I.e., seeking a partner who is more thoughtful/sharing. I have no issue sharing what I have in life with partners/friends/family, etc. Life is so fucking hard and it takes a village just to exist. I would like to see that care returned to me in my romantic partnership. So, I really do appreciate you all for that. 

I have no intention whatsoever to sue or pursue any avenue that gets the money I have invested back.  I did it on my own volition as a way to take care of her prior to ever having an idea this inheritance would happen. I know this sounds stupid but it is what feels most right for me. And I promise I have no intention to invest in anything else unless there is a formal, written agreement ensuring I receive what I have invested back. I plan to see how our conversation in therapy goes before I take the steps to find housing elsewhere. 

I know that this doesn’t address every comment and I am sorry if I glossed over anything or left things unclear or if this wasn’t really what you wanted to see. It just feels sort of overwhelming to process because there is so much nuance tied into it. Beyond the glaring financial disparity between us now, the layers of hurt that have happened feel highlighted. I am working to make peace with it all. I know that she and I try our best, even if/when it falls short. All we can do is our best, I suppose. 

Anyways, thanks for reading my wordy novel. Again, I appreciate the grace and advice you all have offered! ",1732948858.0,ThrowRA__clueless,relationship_advice
I (37F) suspect infidelity because I found condoms. Husband (38M) and I have not used condoms in years. What do I do next?,"UPDATE 06 Aug 2024
TLDR I found a ereceipt for the rubbers. They are his, no other *obvious* signs of infidelity 

Hello all
Sorry it’s a long one

It’s been a little while. RIP my inbox, I read so many comments and messages; many or most of them were helpful. I was so shocked and frightened that I just could not think calmly or what to do next, all of you helped me, you really did and I am thankful.

Last week I had probably one of the most horrendous days of my life. Let me try to explain a bit more clearly what happened and what’s happening. I won’t give exact details to preserve anonymity.

I was away from my husband 38M and 3 kids for almost 6 months. This was because I had to go with my sister to help our mum. She had a severe stroke and was not expected to make it, my sister was in pieces (she still spoke with mum even though I didn’t). Husband encouraged me to stay, he helped pay for ticket.

Originally I was only supposed to stay there to pretty much help bury her and then come back after a few weeks. However she’s surprised us all by staying alive and recovering somewhat, anyway there were still complications with her recovery physically mentally financially and I could not leave. I did not want to go in the first place, I did not want to stay and I sure as shit didn’t want to deal with her. I had not spoken or seen my mother in about 17 years because of her addiction issues. I never thought I’d ever see her again and I had massive emotional trauma to deal with.
But you know what? I’m glad I went. I faced my demons and showed compassion I did not know I was capable of, whilst I shall never be buddy buddy with mum, it has done good for my psychological/mental health.

And I realise now… my mental health has been shit. For years. Even before the kids were born. My husband tried to help but I was stuck fast wallowing in a depressed funk, I blamed my mum for my poor mental health and let myself go (physically and mentally).

For years I’d been sinking further and further down and yes it affected my relationships particularly with my husband.

My husband is a hard working insightful generous man. He has always supported me, never laid a finger on me and I feel safe around him. He is and always has been an excellent father. He has his faults, don’t we all?  But I love him and I know he loves me.

When I came back from my journey of rediscovery, my husband was expecting ‘the old me’. The depressed miserable bitchy moany not-sexy pessimistic me. I admit it to myself and it’s a hard pill to swallow - I think back at how I treated myself and my husband, the awful negative thoughts I had and I am ashamed.

Needless to say in all these years our physical/sex life was in the pits. Our marriage was crap. I admit it and I’ve cried all the tears I’ve had crammed up these past 17 years since I locked my hurt and pain away with my mother’s abandonment and abuse. 

I lost weight on my trip (almost 15kgs!) I’m off my antidepressants and eating healthy (without even trying!) In the past few months I’m actually interested in the day and what it brings, I’m present for my children and I feel like I’m in control.

However, when I came back I had to not exactly grovel, but a big apology/explanation was owed and it was hard to get the words out but I said them and I meant them.

I was unpacking drawers and I found condoms. I have an IUD and we haven’t used rubbers in years and years. The expiry date on these condoms was 2027 so not a chance they were old. I am a bit shamed to say I did discreetly search his email/messges and found the receipt for them in Amazon, he did buy them about 1 month ago. Only one is missing and I noticed the toys had been moved so I am certain that he used it on himself. I did search for other suspicious items etc but there were none.
I did check messages and there is nothing suspicious. Nothing at all. My husband hasn’t been behaving suspicious and I think when I confronted him with the condoms I found he just blurted out a bs excuse and because of the distance between us he wouldn’t admit using them on himself (yet).

I also had a look at our finances and I am ashamed to see how hard my husband has been working to keep a roof over our heads. Nothing suspicious going on and we are lucky to have him so committed. I have sadly heard in other comments about how some people just dump the partner with kids when it gets too tough.

The fear I felt in that moment, that yes, he was cheating, was overwhelmingly real. I can see how my refusal to get help, not be physical and always a moany cow could push him away. I don’t see him starting another relationship, but I could see him maybe using a service. Maybe? I dunno.

So Will I throw away 15+ good years (mostly) away for this? No. I am going to do the best I can because these past years have been pretty fucking awful and he has been working so damn hard and I have just been… consumed with self loathing. I know I know I can’t take the blame for absolutely everything that’s gone wrong. However I’m starting with what I can. I have for the first time in a looooong time felt actually excited about what I can do with the future.

BUT I will definitely 100% be getting a job to make myself self sufficient. Cheating/divorce isn’t the only way a partner can leave you and this whole event has shown me a warning shot that I need to get a grip and find a job. I have also started some online courses to brush up on skills I haven’t used in years. I’ve updated my cv again (using AI software what a trip!) and I in fact already have an interview set up 2 weeks from now.

AND I will also discreetly consult a lawyer/citizens advice bureau to find out the ‘what if’ we get divorced because knowledge definitely is power.

And I must explain that I didn’t cry my eyes out and terrify the children like some comments suggested. There is no trauma, they’re fine and I’ve gotten a hold of myself. I cried once or twice coming out the bathroom and then went for a long ass walk to cry and try get hold of myself.

So… one condom missing from a box seems to be the catalyst for my life. Made me look at what is actually of value.

Whatever happens, I know I’ll be fine. I realise now how difficult things have been for my husband and how I wasn’t helping at all. The shame still makes me cry and I am hoping that’s a good thing actually, because I year ago I wouldn’t have given a shit, just would have done some more self-destructive behaviour probably. 

Thank you all for your comments. Really. I really mean it, a lot of them helped me shake some sense into me and allow for self-reflection.

It is early days yet, but I am hopeful. My husband was smiling at me across the room the other day after I had done something for him and it’s the first time in ages I saw that. He said something flirty and I felt butterflies. Not disgust and contempt like a year or two ago.

Anyway. I have rambled a lot and I’m not going to edit this. Maybe I’ll update again, maybe I won’t. But yes again thanks so much for your help.

Married 15 yrs have had an ok marriage, went a bit pear shaped after having 3 kids in 4 years (9f 7F 5M).
I found a box of condoms on the drawer after I’d been away for a while, he denies they’re his just said he accidentally found them in a box in garage somehow. It’s a pack of 30 and one is missing…
I am freaking out crying my head off my marriage is over I think.
What do I do next? How do I get a lawyer? I can’t afford one I’m a stay at home pastime time working mum with no savings. I don’t see us getting through this (he’s checked out I can feel it)
Oh god the pain the pain the pain I have never felt this pain, people driving by acting normal with their lives and I am dying agony inside.
I want to check his emails/messages but is that a bad idea? Sorry for a mess grammar I can’t see through the tears. Kids keep asking me why I’m crying 😭 
Tldr found condoms in drawer, we haven’t used condoms in years. I suspect cheating, what do I do next?

I (M35) regret leaving my wife (F29) at the airport,"My wife got a new job where she started making several times what she was making before. I was incredibly happy for her since this was her first time making six figures. I've been making six figures for several years now and have funded most of our lifestyle. She had a history of putting me down, but as soon as she started making more money, it amplified considerably. She'd criticize everything I would do and nothing I did seemed to be right in her eyes. As an example, we'd go on several trips a year (at least one international and a few domestic) which I've always fully paid for. Although we travel more than most people, she said that she wasn't satisfied because I ""never flew her first class."" Although we stay in nice hotels (clean and safe 4+ star hotels), she said they were ""never Instagram worthy."" She'd often compare our life to influencers and I'd have to remind her that what she sees on social media is not real.

We went on a vacation along with her parents and sister. On the last day, we visited a few sites and we began the several hour trip to the airport. Everyone slept while I drove the family around. We flew back home and as soon as we deplaned, she started yelling at me on the concourse. She said so-and-so's husband is doing X for their wife, and demanded to know why I'm not doing the same for her. She kept yelling at me as we made our way through the terminal. It was all just one big blur.

As soon as we got landside, I suggested I get the car from the parking garage while she grabs the checked in luggage. I see her waiting by the door and I pulled up as far as I could before I got to the handicap loading zone. She was yelling at me to move closer and ""it didn't matter because it was late at night."" Although no-one was around, it still doesn't sit with me right to park in a handicap loading zone. She was mad and came up to the car and started yanking on the door handles. She dropped something in the car and went back for the luggage that was about 30 feet away. I was getting out to load the bags into the trunk.

She yelled something at me and something in me snapped. I told her I was not going to put up with this anymore and told her to call an Uber home as I drove off. As I was leaving the airport, I had a change of heart and decided to turn around and pick her up. I came back to the terminal and she wasn't there anymore. I checked Find My and it looked like she was moving along with the AirTags in our luggage, so I assumed she must've gotten an Uber home.

I come home and see a taxi in front of our home. It turned out she left her purse and phone in the car, while she went to go back for the luggage. She said it was some miracle from God that she found a taxi driver willing to drive her home without her wallet or phone, and that it was a sign for her to leave me. She moved out two weeks later and ultimately filed for divorce.

I still think about that night. I question myself if things would've been different if I just kept my cool. I've lost my partner but I'm in a state of peace that I haven't been in a long time. How do I stop reliving that moment? ~~I've since taken several trips through that airport and relive that incident every time.~~ I've taken several flights since the incident and every time I pass by the area where this happened (the bottlenecked exit out of airside), I'm reminded of what happened. Sorry for the confusion.

TLDR: I snapped and left my wife at the airport. It was the straw that made her leave and file for divorce.

EDIT: It's sad that people seem to think this is fake. I'm trying to be as detailed as possible without doxxing myself.

Why did I put up with it so long? We built a life together. We had our home, our friends, our dog, and it felt like it was time to start a family. When things were bad, they were terrible, but on the good days, they were amazing. We're both South Asian, and divorce has a terrible stigma in our culture. I made a commitment to this person and I planned on sticking with it.

I'm not innocent. I have a terrible time communicating when someone is yelling at me. I walk away from the situation rather than fighting, especially in public. This in turn upsets her because she feels like she's not being heard, which makes her even more upset.",1691548723.0,Medical-Meat-7248,relationship_advice
"Wife (F33) gave me (M35) an ultimatum that I can't fulfill, but it's hard to set a boundary. How do I best navigate this?","Throwaway because I fear that reddit-using friends will identify us.

So, we're together for 4 years, married for 2, and it's been rough for the past six months or so. Something about my spouse has changed - she started having really powerful and increasingly frequent emotional outbursts when something doesn't go her way, or her expectations are not met. During those she will drag me (and only me, she doesn't do that to others thankfully) down and treat me like the worst human being in the world, berating me and sometimes threatening divorce. That said, after an outburst is over, she will always apologize and outside of them she is a very supportive partner who I believe genuinely loves me and who accepts my expressions of love as well. To avoid running afoul of rule 4, I won't go into detail about her mental health, and the actual advice I want is about a more specific situation. The outbursts are just part of the context.

So, a couple of months ago I quit my job to start my own business in my field. This was something that I did after thoroughly discussing it with my wife and with her explicit encouragement. I articulated numerous times to her that the transition most likely would cause us some financial hardship for a period of six months to a year, and she always told me she would be fine with that and would also work to support us. Currently she is between jobs. Her taking up even a modest part-time job would be enough to keep us safely afloat.

Now, the same week I quit my corporate job she sat me down and told me that she wants to start trying to a baby. Like, now. When I pushed back on that and asked her to wait until my business is a little more off the ground, it led to a big fight and a divorce threat - or rather, for the first time in our relationship, a divorce ultimatum: start trying now or we're done. After she calmed down, she agreed to wait a month, which frankly is nowhere near sufficient but it is what it is. When I asked her what we're going to do if the child is born before we're financially secure, her response was that she'll get jobs, I'll get more jobs, her family will help with childcare, and we'll pull through. Not easy, but okay, if we both work, if we both commit to it, it's doable.

The transition to running my own outfit started better than I expected and I was able to make a slightly bigger chunk of money at the start than we planned for. Still, this doesn't change the fact that I need my wife's financial support during this stage. And yet, just a few days ago, during another outburst caused by an unrelated issue she suddenly told me that she doesn't feel secure with me anymore, doesn't believe I can succeed independently, and (and that part was the real kick in the stomach) doesn't want to balance childcare with work and so wants to be a SAHM for the first 2-3 years of our child's life. And finally, she gave another ultimatum - secure a ""sufficient"" (she declined to name a sum) income by the end of next year, or we're done, regardless of whether we're parents by then or not. After she came back to her senses she did apologize and claimed she ""didn't mean"" what she said, but I haven't quite had the courage to ask if that includes the divorce ultimatum and the SAHM part. Realistically, given the conditions she has set, I would need to be making enough by next year to provide for a SAHM wife and an infant. I'm not sure I can meet that within that timeframe - which is exactly why I wanted to wait before trying for a baby.

Now, normally ultimatums like the ones she gave me would be where I would set a hard boundary. To her last one I would say ""Honey, I would love to provide that lifestyle for you, and I plan to eventually, but getting there in one year is not something I can honestly promise. More likely than not I won't achieve that so soon. If that's a deal breaker for you, if waiting longer and/or working yourself is totally unacceptable to you now, then we might need to start thinking of separation"" As much as it would break my heart to even talk of separating, let alone actually going through with that, I believe in the importance of setting and maintaining boundaries to have a healthy relationship, and also in good old honesty and not making promises I'm not sure I can keep.  
The problem is, I'm an immigrant and depend on my wife for my residence status here (not the US). In fact, until I can secure permanent residence, which is a couple of years away, my ability to even run the business hinges on maintaining my spousal visa here. So if I set that boundary and she decides to separate, that's it, I'll be finished. My best hope would be to try to quickly get a job that can sponsor residency for me, but that's *extremely* unlikely to happen and realistically I would probably have to go back to my country of birth where none of my skill sets could land me a job and where, due to international sanctions, I wouldn't even be able to transfer any of my savings or even just carry them back as cash. I'd be destitute.  
My wife doesn't know how much I depend on her. She understands that the spousal visa affords me more freedom but doesn't quite realize how bad the consequences for me would be if I were to move back. Initially I didn't want to tell her that because I didn't want it weighing on her in case she ever considered divorcing me, and now that she's been having those emotional outbursts I'm also wary that if I told her, she might impulsively use that knowledge to do something we both might badly regret later.  
Now, many will probably ask why I chose to become so dependent on my wife. Before that, I was relying on employers to sponsor my residence in this country and going from that to my spouse, someone I was marrying because I saw her as a kind and supportive partner and the love of my life, felt like an upgrade. I trusted her more than any of my employers and generally still do. I just didn't expect that she would ever make such demands on threat of divorce. If there were any red flags I sure as hell missed them.
As it stands, it's been a few days and things between us are back to normal except obviously her ultimatum still weighs on me. So far I just can't find the courage to talk about it with her.

I'm already talking with a legal professional about my options in case she does decide to end the marriage, but my question to the sub is - how do I best navigate this going forward, if my ideal goal is to save our marriage and relationship?  So far my plan is to just sort of hope for the best and keep the current course. I understand that the outcome is not up to me only, but I'd like some outside opinions on how best to move forward - perhaps tell me what you would do in such a situation?  
Thanks in advance!",1733990944.0,Hour_Industry7887,relationship_advice
"My [40M] date [39F] said I violated her consent in terms of kinks. What exactly is a ""kink""? I thought I was vanilla...","**EDIT: Thank you everyone for the replies! I need to head to bed now, so I can't reply anymore. But be assured that I got the confirmation from you that I needed and that I won't repeat the mistakes I made. I am very upset that I had to learn my lesson by hurting a really awesome woman and will make sure to be a better person in the future and communicate a lot more before and during sex.**



Hello community! Sorry if parts of this are NSFW and also for mistakes, as I am not a native speaker.
  

  
I \[40m\] need help to understand if I really messed up and need to reevaluate myself or if the woman I was seeing \[39F\] was just incompatible with me.
  

  
I have been single for a bit over two years after a 14-year-long relationship and ready to put myself out there again. I used a dating app for the first time and after a few dates not leading to anything, I matched with who I will call Dana. Dana and I got along amazingly. She had a good job, but valued free time and family over career, we agreed on everything important (like being childfree) and she was an even bigger gamer than me, which is pretty rare in my age group. In the almost two months we dated, we had a blast.
  

  
One of the things on her dating profile was that she directly said that she was only really into vanilla sex. So obviously, after a few dates, I asked her about that. She very openly told me that she had tried quite a few things in her life, but most things simply hadn't appealed to her. My worries that oral was off the table were also not warranted; she was completely fine with that, but said that for medical reasons, anal was not possible. All totally fine with me and I also never thought of myself as kinky and more vanilla. As in, there were no red flags showing.
  

  
After seven weeks, we had sex for the first time and that's when it all went wrong. At first, it was great because she was an active participant and also vocal, but maybe it should have tipped me off that she stuck with things like ""You're so handsome!"" and ""You smell so good!"". Well, things got more heated and I just instinctively said stuff like ""Your ass is gorgeous!"" or ""Your cunt is so wet!"" and that's when I noticed that she withdrew and asked me if I ""couldn't call her body parts something that isn't also used as an insult"". I was a bit taken aback and I think I muttered an apology, but we then continued and she went back to being into it as well.
  

  
But then we decided to do doggy style and well, after a minute or so, I slapped her butt. I didn't even think about it; I had always done that sometimes in my old relationships and it wasn't hard, just a very light smack. She, however, immediately said ""STOP!"", got up, turned around and asked ""Did you just hit me?! What the hell!?""
  

  
I apologized again while she got up and got dressed and I sat there like an idiot before also silently grabbing my clothes. Thankfully, she had calmed down a bit once she was dressed, but she then informed me that we were clearly sexually incompatible and that either we understood ""vanilla"" as very different things or that I violated her consent because she hadn't agreed to a dirty talk kink (which she finds demeaning and insulting) or S&M, ""no matter how light"", as she isn't into pain at all and ""doesn't appreciate being treated like an animal"". She then wished me the best and that I find someone who is into the same things as me soon, but advised me to ask women beforehand before I engage in kinks with them, at least for the first time.
  

  
And so, I need to know: Did I actually violate consent here because I didn't ask if I could lightly dirty talk or slap her butt? To me, with all prior partners, those were always very normal things. To me, those things always were vanilla and never fell under kinks. But I might be very wrong. The friends I asked all basically agreed with me, telling me that while harder slaps or hair pulling or more elaborate dirty talk would be considered kinks, but just using a few dirty words like ""ass"" and not-painful slaps hardly is.
  

  
I genuinely miss Dana, but she obviously removed me from the app. I thought we were a perfect match and I would have been absolutely willing to go along with her wishes in bed - those things are hardly something I require for satisfaction. But I guess all I can do now is ask here if I fucked up or if we just had different definitions of ""vanilla""? I don't want to repeat a mistake, but also not look weird if I ask the next woman I date if I can call her butt an ""ass"".
  

  
Thank you!
  

  
TL;DR: Lightly slapped my date's butt during our first sex and said things like ""Your cunt is so wet"". She said I violated consent because she hadn't agreed to ""dirty talk""- or ""light S&M""-kinks and had told me before that she's only really into vanilla sex. Need to know if I am kinkier than I thought and fucked up.",1717872918.0,ThrowRA_consent101,relationship_advice
I [F45] lost one eye. Boyfriend [M57] of 5 years just told me he no longer finds me desirable,"My partner/boyfriend (M, 57) of 5 years just told me (F, 40s) he no longer finds me attractive since my brain surgery that caused me to lose one eye. So he has gotten a mistress in her 20s for sex. 

I have an eyepatch now and probably will for the rest of my life. But really?!!!! 

I’m not even sure what to do with this.

I’m still recovering so can’t quite leave yet (we live together). But I’m just in shock.

Besides the 10 pounds I gained and the eye patch. I look the same as I did when we started dating.

I’m a former model but I wasn’t when we met. I did my best to find a man that I thought wasn’t with me solely for my looks (cause I knew one day they would go). 

The irony is I stood with  him through chemo. He lost his hair and then he gained 25 pounds and I still made sure he felt desirable. And managed his business while he was sick. 

Im mad at myself for letting this put me in a deep depression. My surgery was a two months ago.Strangers still compliment me on my looks.. I graciously say thank you and move on. So I still believe at least one man will still find me attractive with an eyepatch.

But I just feel awful cause this one person who Ive shared my life with looks at me with disgust. So I cry and then I get mad at myself for crying.

I keep thinking he is crazy but that doesn’t stop the tears. 

So I guess I’m just asking for encouragement from people who are on the other side of leaving an unappreciative partner and now with a good one. And really any encouragement.

I know I’ll get to the other side. But right now this stinks.

EDIT: Wow! To wake up to such support has literally brought me to tears. I’m just overwhelmed with the encouraging words. To know that so many people would take a moment to encourage me will help me greatly as I continue to heal my body and begin my solo chapter. I may not be able to respond to each comment (I have to rest my good eye), but I appreciate every one! Thank you so much!",1691377222.0,Purple-Apple-234,relationship_advice
Wife(26F) said I(31M) have a small d*ck during a fight,"Hello folks,

Me (31M) and my wife(26F) have been married for a year and ever since that, we've been having a lot of fights. It is always an emotional outburst from her where she is crying profusely, telling me how bad of a person I am, shouting and slamming doors at my face. For the last one year when she went into her emotional outburst mode, I would shut down mentally and it would take me 2 or 3 days to recover to even talk to her. 


She keeps saying I'm not there for her emotionally when she is low and sad but how can I be there for her, when it is always an emotional outburst and pretty much telling me how bad of a person I am? 
I told her so many times, please be calm and communicate your issues calmly. But that is never the case. Her discussion of her issues start with emotional outbursts.

Last night, we had a big fight and during the fight she said I have small dick. That she wishes if she was having sex with somebody who has a bigger dick, who could make her orgasm. I was taken aback by this as it came out of nowhere. She also proceeds to say, ""why are you acting surprised, don't you know you have a small dick? Life must be difficult with a small dick"". 

This hurt me so much. And I said I don't want to be with her any longer and I want a divorce. 

The next day, she has been apologizing profusely. She told she said all that deliberately to hurt my feelings to get a reaction from me. Who would even get so nasty deliberately?

Two weeks before this, when we were having a good time and having sex, I just passed a comment in an amusing way that she has loosened up compared to the year before as it was a struggle for me to put it in back then and now it goes in so much easier and we continued to have sex.

She is now accusing me of calling her loose when I said it in an amusing way whereas she said I had a small dick to hurt me deliberately. 

I want to forgive her, she has been apologizing profusely, but I feel like it has done irreparable damage to my confidence and I can't see myself being intimate with her again. 

Lately, even before this incident happened, I've had so much resentment towards her because of her emotional outbursts and how rudely she talks to me, that even I have started to raise my voice and answer back the same way she does. 

I already have so much resentment towards her and with this small dick comment, I just want to call it quits. What should I do? Is there anyway to recover from this?


EDIT:

 you guys have been asking me what are the kind of things that cause her to lash out. These are some of the examples.
1. In the first few months of our relationship, she always wanted to hold my hand and be lovey dovey in public. I said holding her hand in public is making me self conscious. She got very upset and created a scene out of it. I know I was wrong here. I never made that mistake again.  Still to this day, she says I'm not a good husband because I refused to hold her hand almost 2 years back. I never did that again, by the way. 
2. One weekend, I told her we were meeting my friend and his wife for lunch. She got pissed off that I said ""yes"" without consulting her. She was half-heartedly getting ready and was pissed off, to which I said you can stay, I will go. She was enraged that I said that and started a big fight. My friend and his wife were already at the restaurant. I said it would be rude to cancel at the last moment, so I went alone. She was fuming the whole time that I left here there and went without her. And when I got back, it was one of the biggest fights we've ever had. It still scares me how bad it was thinking about it. I have apologized and have always consulted her since. Even to this day, she recounts this incident and says I don't give her importance. This was 1 year back. 

I try to do my best. I always help her around the house. I cook, I clean, I do laundry. Everytime she wants to go out, we go out. It is never enough. I'm always the bad guy. 

I have tried to amend my mistakes, but everytime, she recounts all these incidents and portrays me as a bad partner for incidents which have happened almost 1.5 to 2 years ago. ",1709542832.0,ThrowRA56765,relationship_advice
Husband (33M) said he would kill me (33F) if I cheated on him. Do I need to run?,"My husband has told me multiple times “if you ever cheat on me I’d kill him, kill you, then kill myself”. 

He seemed serious but calm at the time - just like he was stating a fact. When I brought it up later he said it was a joke, but it wasn’t said jokingly. I saw it more as a manipulation tactic than an actual threat. 

He’s also mentioned things like how if he didn’t have me, he’d have no reason to live, and that he wanted to khs before we met and then he didn’t because he met me. 

My question is: for those of you who have experienced similar, did it escalate? 

EDIT obviously I don’t plan on cheating on him, but I’m wondering *how* concerning these sorts of comments are in a marriage 

EDIT 2:
I’ve put additional context in one of the comments but I’m going to put it here too for new commenters etc. 

Yes, his comment like this was concerning at the time he first made it, but I didn’t really take it seriously. Since then I’ve heard it so many times that it doesn’t bother me any more. Recently there’s been a bit of a development and now I’m questioning everything trying to work out if the man I thought I married was real. 

So, buckle up, this one’s going to be a long one. I’ve left some of the finer details out for the sake of trying to streamline this, but let me know if anything is unclear in the comments. 

When I first met my husband (on hinge) at the end of April 2022, he was suuuuuuper insecure and controlling. About 4 weeks into the relationship, he discovered (by going through my phone) that I’d had a thing with someone like 2 weeks before I met him, and accused me of cheating on him. I’d stopped seeing the other guy (let’s call him K) as soon as I’d met my husband in person, because I knew it was something I wanted to pursue, but at the same time I was telling Husband I wasn’t ready for a relationship, that we needed to take things slowly, that I wasnt his girlfriend. Apparently this didn’t matter because when he found out I’d “cheated” he flipped out, threatened to kill himself, threatened me with violence (“I should be kicking your teeth in”) and overall made my life a misery. I was scared to go to sleep because I worried that he would hurt himself while I was asleep, or go through my phone and find things from before I met him to start worrying about. If he did, I’d get woken up asking who I’d sent this or that picture to (like a month or two before he and I even started talking). I was told it was gross and that I needed to cut every guy in my life off. 

I did what he asked because I loved him, and because I was scared if I broke it off that he would do something really rash. 6 months later, I was tired of having my location tracked everywhere I went, I was tired of him leaning on me for emotional support, so I tried to break things off. He sat there and cried and told me he would change and he wouldn’t be the same person again. I asked him to leave the house, and he said he would go sleep in his car (his brother lives a 5 minute drive from us). I said I wasn’t going to let him sleep in his car, so I let him stay in the house on the couch on the understanding that he would not come into the bedroom. I woke up at 2am or so with him standing over me, telling me he was looking for something I’d already given him (I suspect he wanted to look through my phone again). I came home from work the next day to find a list of homeless shelters on a piece of paper beside his bed. I figured that I was *supposed* to see this and feel bad for him. 

The next day he promised to change, so I gave him a chance to make things right. He promised me he would be the man I deserved, treat me like a princess, etc etc. 

Everything’s been mostly good since then, he seemed perfect, I thought I’d found my soul mate. except for one night about a month ago when I was using his phone and I needed to go back in his browser history to find something. I found a load of links to male escort listings on Locanto, and then a load of gay porn (he’d searched specifically for like “young hot cock” and “cute young guy jerking off”. When I asked him about it, he at first he pretended he had no idea what I was talking about. He then said “I don’t even know what that was for” and THEN he told me that he was scared because his d!ck was unresponsive, that he was trying to “handle himself” to pics/videos of me/us and it wouldn’t get hard. He then said he freaked out and that was his reaction - “to see if it did anything”. He said he started with the listings and then went to porn, “had a flick through” and then closed it when it didn’t do anything for him. I said I didn’t understand, because we had made love the day before and it seemed to work fine then, and that he had a doctors appointment the next day so he could have asked about it then. 

I asked him if he had tried gay porn before and he said yes, when he was much younger, and that it didn’t do anything for him. I said I was struggling to understand how he would turn to this suddenly if he’s never been interested before. He ended up getting really defensive and screaming at me that he was “freaking out” and “I can’t believe you think I’m gay”. I said it was no problem if he was bi or bi-curious (I’m bi) but that the escort listings were a massive concern to me (and he knew how I would have felt about it). 

I ended up speaking to someone close to him about it and then it came out of the bag that something he’d told me at the start of our relationship was a complete fabrication. He’d told me that the car accident he was in when he was 18/19 was a suicide attempt - turns out this was a lie, and that there was someone else in the car with him. I told him I didn’t understand why he would lie about that, and he was super evasive and defensive. At the same time, i questioned him about a few other things that had been weird throughout our relationship and it turned out that they were all lies too. 

Throughout our relationship, he’s told me how much he values our openness and honesty and how he could never lie to me, even if it was a white lie. I told him that all of these things being untrue was extra concerning considering he was always so vocal about the importance of honesty and trust with your partner. I told him that I was struggling to trust him at this point and asked him if there was anything else he had lied to me about or hidden from me throughout our relationship - told him it was a lie amnesty, and that I just wanted everything else out on the table so we could go ahead with a clean slate and a bit of therapy. 

This whole time he was being super evasive and was telling me that there was nothing else he’d ever hidden or lied to me about, that he was going to be completely honest from now on and that I knew everything now. I still didn’t believe him so he offered me his phone and Google account and told me to put my mind at rest. 

Turns out he didn’t clean up as well as he had thought because I discovered:
- No, it wasn’t the only time he’d looked at escort listings since we’ve been together. 
- A few months prior, he’d google searched his ex, then searched for her name and “nudes” and then immediately watched porn and jerked off. 
- The day after my birthday last year, he had been searching for “booty call apps”. 
- Right before we met (when *I* was the gross one for flirting with a guy) that he’d been signing up to no less than 15 hookup apps (with names like “sex finder” and “Aussie milfs” and “one night friend”)
- He’d signed up to “my transgender date” the night before we met in person (after talking for a week and telling me he was smitten with me and couldn’t wait to meet me). 
- Four weeks before we met, he was swapping pics with men on fetlife and talking about what he wanted to do to them, whilst telling them he “likes trans/femboy stuff”. Also liking a lot of pre-op MTF pics on the same site. 
- He’d had some sort of contact with an escort previously (her email address was in his contacts) but couldn’t tell me when or what for. 
- That even though he told me repeatedly how he didn’t see the appeal of onlyfans/sex workers, that he was still searching them more than he ever admitted to watching porn.  
He later admitted that he didn’t realise that Google still saves your searches even if you clear your browser history. 

I tried to understand why he had done these things, whilst also feeling like the person he’d always portrayed himself as was a complete fabrication. When i asked him about searching for nudes of his ex, he immediately flew into a rage, no build up, just straight to 10/10 fury. He screamed at me that he would never ever do that, that he would admit to anything else but not that. He completely lost his mind, I’ve never seen anyone react in that way before. 

Everything else he said he “just didn’t remember”. 

A few days later, I asked him to go stay with family for a bit, so we could clear our heads. A few days later, I decided that I couldn’t ever get over the betrayal that I’d felt, that I felt like I’d married a lie, and that more importantly, the trust was gone. 

About a week later he told me he wanted to come home so he could return to work (his family live 2 hours away). I told him he could stay in the house as long as he respected that we were still separated, and that I didn’t want him coming home and pretending like everything was back on track. He said he totally understood. 

So far it’s not been like that, and he talks about “when” we do stuff and talking about how much he loves me and it’s kinda sent me back in time 2 weeks. I don’t know how I feel and I don’t know what to do. 

He’s since admitted to everything (even though he said he would never do some of those things) and his excuses/reasons just don’t gel. He’s also admitted he’s got a problem with lying and that he doesn’t know why he does it. I told him that I hate that I even felt like I needed to second guess him and that I do NOT want to be the kind of wife who looks through her husbands phone. 

Part of me is hopeful that with enough counselling, we can make this work, but the rest of me fears that now the trust is gone, the relationship is done. 

Maybe I just don’t love or respect myself enough to see how fucked this really is. Maybe I’m gaslighting myself. 

*TL;DR* Husband said he would kill me if I cheated on him, multiple times. I didn’t take it seriously but I’ve since discovered he’s been looking at male escort listings, searching for his ex’s nudes, and compulsively lying.  ",1717865610.0,LucyLamb7,relationship_advice
Boyfriend (37M) and I (40F) have discussed moving in together and he doesn’t believe he should contribute any rent because I make significantly more than him. Can 2 people with such a large disparity in income make it work? ,"My bf and I have been dating for almost 4 months. We have incredible physical, emotional and intellectual chemistry. He’s currently a grad student and living off a stipend where he gets about $30K/year. I’m more established in my career in sales and I make about $150K/year. 

He’s recently divorced, lives at home with his mom and pays her $800/month (not including utilities). 

I just bought a house and he’s been helping me with the move and building furniture. We recently discussed living together because he practically stays over every night anyway. We agreed that instead of him paying his mom $800, that amount would go towards helping me out with the mountain of household expenses it takes to own a home.

The issue is, we’ve had several disagreements regarding finances in the past. Initially, it bothered me that he couldn’t afford to take me out on dates. I’ll admit, I’m not a cheap date, I enjoy good food and drinks. However, it makes me sad to see him struggling to afford taking me out so to compromise, I’ve been cooking almost daily to help both of us save money. 

Recently, we got into a big argument because he was pushing the subject of officially moving in with me and I asked when he would start contributing to our household bills. Outside of occasionally pitching in for groceries, he hasn’t given me any money, I also pay for more than half of our dates. He got angry and said he would not pay me the “rent” we agreed on and instead, he would just pay anything extra in what he uses in utilities since my household expenses would be something I was paying regardless if he moved in or not. 

I got upset and said he would still be paying rent regardless if he didn’t move in but he said the difference now is that I’m profiting off of him. He said as a partner, I should want to cover more (AKA all) of the household expenses since I make significantly more. He said me collecting rent from a partner who barely makes much is like me being a greedy landlord. I took great offense to this and was shocked he would think I’m profiting off of him. He stormed out after I called him a mooch and we haven’t really been on speaking terms since.

Am I being a greedy landlord for wanting him to pitch in $800/month (an amount he’s already giving his mom)? I’m not asking him to pay half of even a third of what my expenses are, not even a quarter. I’m so appalled and disappointed that we get along so many ways but can’t see eye to eye on money. 

What should I do here? Can 2 people with such a large disparity in income make it work? 

*** EDIT/UPDATE: Thank you everyone for all your advice. I have put a lot of thought into my relationship and have decided it's best not to continue.

My now ex saw the post and he did not take responsibility for his actions. He said I was mean, unappreciating and domineering during our relationship which threw me off because practically everyday we were together, he would constantly tell me how sweet and amazing I was. He said he contributed plenty by helping me out with dishes, building furniture, groceries and meals he would buy me. Whenever we went to a nicer restaurant that I wanted to check out, I would foot the majority of the bills for those (over 80%) because I knew it would financially burden him too much. I want to make it clear that he did pay for some of our dates and meals, the ones that were more feasible for him. I was cool with that and appreciative, it worked for us. We went on plenty of low cost dates like hiking, game nights with friends, movies at my house, etc. During our relationship, I never felt like he was with me for my money, we mostly enjoyed our time together and had amazing chemistry. I love to cook and it never bothered me to cook most our meals at home. 

To answer some of your questions and to clarify a little more - his father was gravely ill last year with cancer so he moved home with his parents to take care of them during his separatation. His father has then passed and he lives with just his mom now and has been helping her out. I don't want to comment on the reason for his divorce because I truly don't know. What he told me were the reasons may not be the full truth. 

When we had initially talked about him moving in with me, my plan was to wait until after he had graduated and found a stable job. We would have been dating for a year then. The $800 he normally gives his mom would go towards utilities and groceries, not rent as I did not want to view him as tenant. At the time, we both agreed that would be a fair split. 

As we were talking yesterday, he said I was misleading in my post and the reason he pushed to move in was to help *ME* out. Which doesn't makes any sense to me because when it actually came time to contribue to the bills, he never offered to pay anything and when I asked him when he would, he lashed out, called me a greedy landlord and that he would only contribute anything extra in utilities that he incurred as anything more would be me profiting off of him, which is how this fight started. 

Instead of being humbled by the really insightful feedback here, he proceeded to say my comment section was filled with all the bitter, single feminists on Reddit telling me to run and that I could do better. He said my clock was ticking and I don't have much time to find a man. I also don't want children btw so there really was no rush to move in together and I was naive and blinded by love, which caused my temporary lapse in judgement. That's definitely not happening again. I've worked incredibly hard to get to where I'm at and during the breakup, he said that my skills aren't worth half of what I'm getting paid. 

So yeah, we're no longer together and I have peace in knowing it would have never worked out. Thank you Reddit for helping me realize how incompatible we were and had he moved in, it would have been a disaster. ***

My 29M partner left me 32F behind during an earthquake while I'm pregnant,"This just happened: I live in a country known for earthquakes this time of the year. We were together in the living room, while I was on a work conference video call, when the alarms started going off in our building and on our phones, and the building started to shake a bit. It took me a moment to register what was happening but by the time I got up, he had already taken the two dogs and was running downstairs. As mentioned, I was on a conference call, no shoes on and no bra on and I'm 6 months pregnant. I tried to act quickly and made it downstairs where he already was with the dogs.

Luckily everyone was fine. When we got back to the apartment , I told him how he acted really upset me. He did not even hesitate to leave me behind to fend for myself and his unborn child. He defended his actions and basically told me I needed to act quickly or I'm fucked in those situations. 

It's not as if I needed him to hold my hand during that moment, but he didn't even wait a second to make sure I was good to go. I'm really upset because obviously I'm not in able bodied shape due to being pregnant and im hurt his reaction was basically , it's your fault you're slow I'm not going to wait for you. 

I need some perspective on this. I think it's pretty obvious why I would be upset about this, but can someone give me some perspective on his side so I can understand why he's defending his position? Are we both valid? Or is he being an AHOLE?

Also, for some quick background: I am foreign to this country and have been here a year and I'm not very experienced in these situations.

EDIT: thank you guys for your overwhelming response to this. We finally talked when things calmed down and he agreed he reacted poorly, he should not have defended his behavior, and that moving forward his priorities would be (and should have been in the situation) me and the baby. We also discussed what our earthquake plan would be since we live in a country where they happen frequently (I upset some people with the seasonal comment...) and we will be talking through this with our therapist next week 

To the people saying : ""well what did u expect him to do!!! Die with you??"" And ""I was perfectly capable of EVERYTHING  during my pregnancy!!!"" - congrats for missing the point and I hope your reading comprehension and empathy skills improve. It's truly weird to see people in the comments saying things like ""being pregnant doesn't give you an excuse for special treatment"" 😐

Just wanted a quick update to the story. I appreciate all of your comments.

Affair partner (25F) attacked me (30F). Struggling with resentment towards my husband (27M) and fear of her.,"My husband and I used to have a good marriage.

I have a lot of work after I moved job roles. We couldn’t spend as much time together. I was exhausted and addicted to my phone. Edit: I spent two hours a day on my phone, I wasn’t cheating on him with my phone.

My husband was convinced I was pulling away from him.

He confided his worries with a female friend, a woman who was interested in him. She convinced him I was cheating. He sought refuge in her. She was very manipulative and capitalized on his childhood trauma.

It was an emotional affair. Then she kissed him. He told me out of guilt the day of. I was crushed. I had never cheated on him. Had never even thought of another man.

He begged me for a second chance. I thought I could move past it because his cheating was “not as bad.”

I have access to his phone, his computer, his location, everything. He gave it to me willingly. I didn’t ask.

His affair partner flipped out when he told her he confessed and that we were going to try reconciling. He was texting her with my permission because I wanted to know if he was telling the truth.

She tried to convince him that I was cheating. Otherwise I wouldn’t have taken him back. Then she said I had no self esteem. He went no contact with her.

After three months, we were both in individual and marriage counseling. We were doing well.

Then his affair partner and I ran into each other. I don’t know if she was stalking me or not. She verbally attacked me before she escalated.

I filed a police report. She was arrested and released on bail. However, it will take months before anything happens. I also tried to get a protection order but it’s harder than expected to get.

I found out that she was making TikToks about being the other woman.

My husband has been a model husband since then but my gut tells me to file for divorce. She genuinely scares me.

What do I do when my husband has been a model husband since then but I resent him for bringing her into our life? How do I stop being terrified of her and looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life?",1710772060.0,Throwra_Onion_100,relationship_advice
I (f26) accidentally made my partner (m27) wait outside at 4am for over an hour. Is it over?,"So for context,me (f26) and my partner (m27) have been living at my moms house for a while now…. Things have been up and down for us both so although it’s not the most ideal living arrangement it’s made things slightly easier during this rough patch. However with situations like this it’s becoming a problem. I’ve never been so serious and so in love with someone so I believe sometimes it definitively clouds my judgement on situations but, this time I think I really messed up unintentionally. 

Last night he messaged from work to say he wanted to come home early as he wasn’t feeling too good, (he works nights). I agreed to stay up until he was ready to come home so I could order him a uber cause public transport is not 24hrs here and we don’t drive. Originally he said he’d be done by 2am so I waited up, he then didn’t communicate with me until 3am and at that point I was shattered. I didn’t complain though, I just ordered him the cab and waited for him to be in it so I knew i’d done what I needed to help…
This is where it goes tits up. Sidebar before I continue, EVERYTIME he leaves for work my first question is “do you have your key?” His response was “yes it’s in my pocket”. So as far as I was concerned i’d done my job for the night I could finally rest, phone back on silent and he’d be home soon for cuddles.
But no, he didn’t have his key and of course i was fast asleep and didn’t hear my phone to the point he rang it so many times it died! 
He didn’t ring the bell cause he didn’t want it to wake up my mom or son(5) but 2bh I would have rather he did. So he ended up waiting outside for over an hour until I eventually woke up realised he wasn’t in bed and my phone was dead. I could literally feel the panic rush throughout h my body and I shot up to rush to the door and saw him standing there, I was met by some f’s and offs’ and I knew it wasn’t good.

He is so so so so so angry at me and I completely understand why but then my argument is, I ask him about his key to avoid this very situation from happening because I know myself and I can drop like a fly when i’m tired.
Anyway I’m not asking who’s in the wrong because nothing was done intentionally or maliciously it’s just a shitty situation. 
I just have no idea how to make things right, I know we’ll probably get through it but then I also can see that this is bigger than any other time we’ve “argued” and I genuinely do feel so horrible about it.

Tl;dr: boss decides to split company up between other employees and leaves me out of it. My partner got a slice though and now maybe I’m getting divorced and quitting my job.

My partner (43M) of eight years and I (36F) both work in management at the same small company. Our relationship is generally good, and not in the “it’s good but he hits me sometimes” sense. We have both worked at the company for about nine years. We work in an office with three other managers and the company owner. I would have described my relationship with my colleagues as generally close and friendly. Up until today I thought my job was going pretty well. I thought both of our jobs were.

My job is demanding, and everyone in my office puts a lot of time in to make the company successful. We each bring our own skills to the table and we are all very dedicated. I probably spend way too much time at work, but we all do. I had a pretty productive year last year, and I got my profit-sharing bonus today. It was double what it was last year. I don’t think I am underperforming at work.

Today, everybody but me and our bookkeeper left the office mid-morning for “a meeting”. I asked one of them about it and they wouldn’t tell me. It turns out that my boss wants to retire (not a surprise) and he wants the four other managers (including my partner) to gradually buy him out. He had discussed this plan before, but those times I was included and it was extremely not concrete. Apparently this meeting had been arranged over the weekend over email, and my partner didn’t tell me about it. Nobody told me about it until it was happening. I was deliberately excluded by literally the entire office.  

I was gobsmacked.   

They all went to fucking lunch afterwards and didn’t tell me. 

It feels like I’ve low-key been fired, and I have no idea why. I talked to my partner and he apologized (not gonna cut it right now) and said the reason was something like my boss didn’t want a couple involved in the company split.

"After 9 years I,31f, want to leave my 42m fiancé even though he is a genuinely good man/partner. How do I know this is the right decision? ","What is it like leaving a long term relationship with a good man? 

Me 31F and my fiancé 42M have been together for 9 years since I was 21. In the beginning we could have written a movie for how deeply we fell for each other. 6 months into our relationship his father got diagnosed with ALS and that was our life for 7 years.  We built an addition onto his parents home which we still reside. His father died in 2021. After his death it’s as if my partner and I had to get to know each other all over again. The constant looming  black cloud of his father dying was no longer in the air and things felt peaceful. 

However, I’ve grown so incredibly much during the years of 25-present and I fear that we have grown apart. He’s an incredible man. He’s kind and thoughtful and extremely generous. He would absolutely take care of me in sickness and in health. He always wants the best for me and for me to take care of myself. He tells me he loves me constantly and he’s very sweet. 

But I have this insanely apparent gut feeling that we just aren’t meant for each other. I can’t even tell him exactly why I want to leave and that is the hardest part. He’s so confused and I totally understand. I just know no matter how disconnected we feel, he would never leave. 


I don’t want to be touched and I don’t want to touch him. I don’t want anyone. I don’t love myself and I don’t even recognize the woman in the mirror anymore. I told him that I feel like I need space to learn who I am and who I am destined to be. I believe that for some reason he is holding me back from my true potential. 

There’s core values that we both have that just don’t align and they never will but he won’t acknowledge that. He is an extremely logical and type A person and I am an artist. There’s a huge disconnect in our souls and I’ve tried to explain it to him but I don’t know if he pretends he doesn’t feel the disconnect or what. But it’s so very obviously there. 

We had the conversation tonight and it didn’t go well. He’s going to stay here in the addition he built because it truly is perfect for him. But now I have to completely uproot my life and start over. 

I’m so scared. But this gut feeling is so strong.

My question is does any of you have any advice or stories about leaving a long term relationship based solely off of gut feelings and not by your partner doing anything truly specific to make you leave?",1733474211.0,bria-fox,relationship_advice

**TL;DR** My gf is a passionate vegan and wants me to get rid of my beloved cat because cats eat meat and kill mice.

First of all, let me say thank you for everyone who offered advice. There are over 7,000 comments on my original post and I have dozens of PMs. Frankly I'm still pretty overwhelmed with the magnitude of the response. I did my best to read most everyone's comments but obviously I couldn't get to everything!

I would also like to preempt this post by saying, as many users pointed out, that my GFs extreme views on domestic cats are not representative of the vegan/vegetarian community as a whole. I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.

So, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.

I called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. 

So, yeah. That's really it.

Oh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:

Ex-wife(F36) shared online that I(M36) left her because she couldn’t have kids. Should I even say anything?,"We divorced 3 years ago. We were trying for kids for about a year, but to  no avail. One day, out of nowhere, she drops on me that she doesn’t want kids. I tried telling myself that maybe I don’t want kids also, so I stayed to work on our relationship for another year and ½. Needless to say, I realized that not having children was not for me and I definitely did want kids. When I told her this, she said that she still didn’t want any kids.  It was over after that.

I am now in another relationship and engaged. My current partner and I are expecting and she announced it on instagram. She does have quite a big social media fanbase, so the post did get some attention.  I’m not really interested in the social media, that’s her thing, I’ll appear in her videos occasionally but like I said, thing not mine. All was well, generally good responses. This was around 2 weeks ago.

I went to a gathering with some friends on Saturday. As soon as I walk in…silence. (These are mutual friends of my ex-wife and I). One of my actual friends pulled me aside and showed me something my ex-wife had said online and even attached pictures of us. What she said was so far from the truth. Think of it as a podcast style video, just not too long. She said that she was left because she was infertile. Then she started explaining how she feels like all the progress she made is set back to 0 because I announced I’m having a baby.

I mean this is…such a lie. She does have a low fertility rate, that part is not a lie, but I did not leave her because of that. I was very into exploring other options, but she did not want to, and I wanted to be a dad. We were incompatible at that point, that is why I filed for divorce. I prefer to keep all of this offline, so when I am asking should I say anything, I am asking if I should say anything directly to my ex-wife? I was thinking about 1. Asking her why she would lie and 2. Asking her to tell the truth (this might not happen, but might be worth a shot).",1696335162.0,throwra513l,relationship_advice
"I (39F) heard something my husband (45M) said on a phone call, and it shook me. How do I talk to him about it?","I (39F) have been married to my (45M) husband for eight years now. He has a friend, ‘Brian’ (40M), who worked with my husband at his old job. Brian has a wife, ‘Helen’ (39F), and young daughter (4F). Brian and my husband used to be close friends and drinking buddies, but they haven’t hung out in person for several years. My husband has told me in the past that he no longer wants to talk to Brian because he’s a negative person, but they still text and call each other sometimes.

Last week I heard my husband on the front porch talking on the phone. I thought he sounded different, so I put my ear against the front door to listen (I know, I know). Basically, I pieced together that Brian cheats, or tries to cheat, on his wife when he goes out drinking, and my husband encourages it.

They were joking about Brian’s friends switching partners and having a threesome, which I thought was weird and out of character. Then I heard my husband say, “So, you went to the bar. Did you get any action?” like it was a normal question he asked all the time. They also mocked Helen for “calling Brian 50 times” to check up on him while he was out and joked about her installing a GPS tracker on Brian’s phone. My husband said that Brian used to be careful with his phone because he “didn’t want Helen to see the texts between (Brian) and (my husband).”

Guys, my husband sounded like a totally different person. My stomach dropped as I heard everything. I’m still in shock. I never thought my husband would condone cheating, but to also be so calm and almost gleeful about it? I’m feeling hugely disillusioned. And I’m thinking about all the times Brian and my husband used to go out to the bars years ago, and was this or something worse happening then? My thoughts have been spiraling, and I’m walking around in a daze.

My husband doesn’t know what I heard, but I feel like everything has changed. I know I need to talk to him, but I don’t know how. I’ve never been good with confrontation or speaking when I’m emotional. How do I handle this conversation?

TL;DR – I overheard my husband on the phone encouraging his friend's cheating and bad behavior, and now I'm spiraling and don't know how to talk to him about the breach of trust.

[UPDATE] You were right. I ignored every single one of your comments and eventually caught my wife with the other man,"This is a tough pill to swallow, and I can't say I hadn't been warned. [This is my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said) Many folks asked me to follow up with an update so here it is, fresh from the oven.

After reading every single comment of the reddit post, my brain just couldn't overcome the catastrophe and the collapse of the world I had built for me in which my wife is my love, my best friend and partner, as well a the person I admire the most. She was entirely perfect, and made me happy for many years. I thought no couple in the world could have what we had. We were both very happy for a long time. We were both attractive, we were both inherently good, had big hearts and were individually wildly successful in our careers.

After the reddit post, I moved to an airbnb and eventually with family to think things through. It was a terrible time but a psychologist helped me recover from a terrible mental state. It coincided with the pandemic hitting very hard in my city (I caught the virus), which didn't help.

During this time, we kept talking and my wife was very sorry and continued saying they hadn't met. I knew it wasn't true but was willing to forgive the woman of my dreams, who continued being in the highest altar of my universe.

Fast forward last saturday morning, I went back to our place, ready to forgive her and talk things through in the most mature way possible. And well, there she was, but I was the one who received the biggest surprise, to say the least. The guy was in my house naked, and so was my wife. The guy from the messages, the guy from the pics. The one she said she didn't even like. I caught him hiding in my bathroom as my wife was putting her pajamas on. When I saw him hiding in my bathroom, he uttered ""sorry dude"". For a second I asked myself, is this were I kill him? But I instantly replied ""I got nothing against you"", because the guy was just nailing this hot woman. Even if he was doing so in a house full of pictures of me. Pictures of our wedding and our families. Pictures of my dead father who would be so sad to see how the marriage he never witnessed was going to end. He has always been the reason I try to make the world a better place. He passed away two months before our wedding.

I'm sorry. I still love her to death. But I understand enough is enough. Even if my world collapses, I hope I can build a new one without lies and in which I'm not just a blind believer under an altar of a fake god.

My (20F) boyfriend (20M) said that I was embarrassing him while I was giving birth to our baby,"Update post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hv4wc1/update_my_boyfriend_said_that_i_was_embarrassing/fyt0y1e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and we had a baby boy last week. I had a natural birth and my bf was there throughout the whole process. I screamed A LOT and each time I did he whispered something like ""can you stop screaming, you're really embarrassing me"". I also threw up a few times and I saw him cover his face in shame. When I held the midwife's hand for comfort he whispered ""let go of her, stop being so embarrassing"". He also said that my birthing position was embarrassing and called me a few vulgar names.

I'm really upset about his behaviour that day, especially when it was when I needed his support the most. When  I try to talk to him about it he denies ever saying it and that I'm being silly...

Edit: I know that there are a lot of comments but I am reading them all, and I just want to thank everybody for the advice and support so far. :) 
I spoke to my mum about this but she is the very traditional type and although she said his behaviour is wrong, I should try couple counselling first. I really don't think he is going to listen to me when I suggest getting help but I'll try. I am also going to talk to my public health nurse.

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everybody who commented and dmed me with words of support and those who have also been in similar situations. I have since tried to discuss the option of couple counselling to him but to no avail, which didn't surprise me. My mum has agreed to let me stay there until I can find a new place for myself and baby. I haven't said anything to him yet, I've been advised not to so I am still planning out how I am going to take the next step.",1595074903.0,ThrowRA540098,relationship_advice
My (39F) partner (40M) has trouble letting things go,"I (39F) am very much in love with my live-in BF(40M). We're 3 years or so in, and it's at the point that we've identified some unresolved issues between us and are working to improve communication and improve ourselves - both for ourselves and for each other.

I'm fairly good at moving past issues if I feel they've been addressed. I work hard to provide for us (I have 2 kids from my previous marriage). Admittedly, I have lead a fairly sheltered/privileged life. I have supportive family, decent education, not rich but feel secure in my job and future opportunities. I'm white, which comes with it's own unintended privileges, but I can certainly identify how the system has paved an easier road for me. Worst thing I've been through was a toxic 14 year relationship, but honestly, I feel over come through it better. 

My man has been through more than most people. Past relationships, jobs, betrayals by family members and friends, literal war, on top of having to deal with being a black man in America. But in addition to that, he is successful, loving, great sense of humor, a consistent provider, father, and natural leader - truly the kind of man that can bring out the best in people. And he loves me without a doubt and loves my kids. A lot of our life is fucking great. But then there's also the guy that gets overwhelmed and anxious (which, me too. We all do) - when that takes over, he kinda ruminates on past hurts; the big ones that have changed his life, but also the issues that we have gone through. Even the issues that we have addressed and behavior is changed, issues get brought back up, I feel blamed/defensive because I know the progress we have made that feels dismissed. He's expressed he has a hard time letting things go. In his words, ""I've been salty my whole life"". And I can understand this. It's valid. There's been a lot of just shitty things that were out of his control that disrupted his life and set him back for no good reason. But at the same time, his life - our life - is pretty good. He has come so fucking far and worked so hard - he deserves to be happy about it. The woulda/coulda/shoulda's really, really bother him. Again, life is short. I can understand the hurt for wasted time and missed opportunities - but it seems counterproductive to continue to allow these things so much influence on ones mind and behavior when they can't be changed - the present is pretty good all things considered and we can put down a solid foundation today for the future we want. Things outside our control will still happen, but...I choose hope over defeatism.

Obviously, I can't fix his.mindset for him. And I don't want to invalidate his feelings and experiences by comparing them to things I've been through and dealt with. For me, acknowledging that there is absolute shit in this world - but there's also some absolute beauty, helps me to cope with the bad stuff. There's a lot of awful, but also a lot to be grateful for. The present is pretty good and getting better for us - even if it can be exhausting too. And the biggest thing is - the world is outside of our control, we can only choose to make the best of it. I want to support him. But I need help. I'm trying not to take it personally, but sometimes I do feel like his dismissal of my worldview negates the places where we could connect and move forward and make him feel less alone. I know there is a lot I will never experience or understand. But at the same time - it does also start to wear on me that he feels so stuck and salty and applies this mindset to issues in our relationship as well. How can I encourage and support him in processing our spats as well as past traumas? Does anyone have any tips for helping a partner through similar issues? How do we break cycles like this?

TL;DR - Partner acknowledges he can't let go of both his past traumas and our own issues despite us working together to resolve previous miscommunications and hurts. How can I encourage him to healthily move forward without making it seem like ""just get over it"".  Does anyone have any tips for helping a partner when they are stuck?

ETA: Thank you all for being so compassionate and supportive! I truly appreciate the tools, tips, advice and success stories! It's refreshing to see so many people advocating for ways to work on ourselves together and how they fared through that process. Since I didn't put it in the original post, my partner HAS recently started therapy. His therapist is POC with military experience. I also have a therapist I've been with for a number of years. 

My take away is that I can do a better job of holding space for him and only listening (not trying to fix). While not my intent, my ""help"" is landing as dismissive/invalidating. If I'm starting to feel triggered/frustrated, I need to take a break and acknowledge how I am feeling without making him feel badly (making my feelings about his feelings forefront). However, if it gets nasty or disrespectful, disengage and take space until he/we are better regulated.  

You all have given us so many different therapeutic options  to look into and he will discuss with his therapist what he thinks would be beneficial. 

Thank you all so very much and from the bottom of my heart ❤️",1700167775.0,scienceandpuppies,relationship_advice
"I [31m] told my girlfriend [30f] that she is not a trophy wife or status symbol and that we are similar in attractiveness, she views it as me calling her old and ugly","A bit of background my girlfriend and I are 30 and 31 respectively. We have been dating for about a year. I work as a high-level engineer at a good firm and my girlfriend works as a payroll specialist at a good firm too. I make significantly more than her (3x).

Things were good in our relationship until I showed her my retirement/savings. She now doesn't see the point of working and has started framing our relationship in that, she is the beautiful one and that I am the nerdy engineer that was lucky to have her. Before, when we met she was all about making it her own way, eventually starting her own company with her sister in sourcing and recruiting. But now she jokes about driving a Range Rover and wearing Lululemon and going to Yoga.

We were having a discussion again about this 'trophy wife' stuff she brought up that I was nerdy back in the day while she was very popular. I told her she is not a trophy wife, that yes she is attractive but its not a huge difference between us.

I told her had it been the case that I met her when she was 22 and I was my current age than sure, but she isn't 22 anymore. After I said that she just started crying like crazy.

She started saying that I think of her as ugly and used up that her best years are behind are. She just told me that if I am not happy to be with her, why am I even here? to stop wasting her time.

I tried to talk to her but she was in no state for a conversation. I don't know what to say, guys, for me, I just wanted to say that I think we are of similar attractiveness. Like I don't think anyone when they see us turns their head and is like oh she is with him the cause of money? Or damn he is so lucky to be with her. I think it's mutual. She was the one that if anything went after my attractiveness first.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I like the fact that we both work and I don't want to change that dynamic. And I don't want her to think too that she is above me that I am so lucky to have her. I want her to think of us as equals and in my attempt to do that I hurt her feelings. What's the next move?

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr- ever since my girlfriend found out about my savings she has more often entertained the idea of being a stay at home wife. She has tried to bring up the fact that she was more attractive than me as justification why I am so lucky to be with her and why I should accept this.**",1591722406.0,throwRA_trophy_gf,relationship_advice
My (24M) girlfriend (27F) doesn't think I make enough money,"I'm 24 years old, and I currently earn a salary of 130K. My girlfriend of nearly 3 years often compares me to her friends, coworkers, my friends, anyone who she knows earns more money than I do. She constantly tells me she thinks I'm underpaid, she's extremely driven by money whereas I am not. She's 27, most of her friends are a year or 2 older than her, those friends have partners who are older than even they are, and so a few of them make a decent amount more than I do, and I'm reminded of this every so often and I'm so tired of it. For comparison my girlfriend just got a raise and is making around 115K now. Also for more info I was making 70K when we started dating, so have gotten 60K extra over 3 years, but it's still not enough.

I'm not bragging here, but I flatout know that I'm on good money for someone my age, but it hasn't ever been about money to me. As a teenager I was very depressed and insecure and when I finished high school I vowed to turn my life around and make happiness my number one priority, and that's what I did and that's how it's remained. The problem is that happiness isn't her top priority, it's money, she just wants to be rich and personally I don't care enough about that to sacrifice my happiness.

Her boss is about 15 years older than her, makes about 400K and flys business class everywhere, and when my girlfriend found out about this she said her number one goal is to fly business class everywhere. Sure business is nice but I'm just so not aligned with what she wants in life and at 3 years into this relationship I don't know what to do about it.

I'd say about 75% of the time together we're happy, usually when we're not talking about things related to money. She's constantly pressuring me to leave my job while I love my current job and have continuously gotten new opportunities internally and really don't want to leave. She makes me feel inadequate when I know that I'm doing really well for my age, and it sucks. As a person who wants to prioritise my happiness, my current job and pay should be a reason for me to be happy, and it usually is until she makes me feel unhappy about it.

I guess I'm struggling to work out what to do. I feel like I can't take this for much longer but honestly I'm afraid of breaking up. How should I handle a situation where my partner values money more than I do to the point that it makes me so unhappy, but I'm happy with many other aspects of our relationship?",1709811705.0,joshthrowaway1111,relationship_advice
"I[M24] made a word document with all the rules of valentines day, and now my GF[F23] is upset. ","Okay, so.. here's the issue.

I've[M24] been with my GF[F23] for a year. We began our relationship on october 2022. When february 2023 came around, she told me that I had to ask her to be my valentine. I thought it was a bit odd, since we were already in a relationship, but I still asked her anyway another day by text. 

Two days before valentines, she calls me crying because apparently I didn't ask her right. Apparently you have to do it in person or else it doesn't count. I didn't even know valentines day had rules so specific, but I stepped in to fix it anyway. I visited her a day before valentine, brought her a small gift and asked her to be my valentine. All good.

Now, a year later, february 2024, I remembered that I have to ask her to be my valentine. What I didn't remember is that it needed to be in person. She was sad that I didn't remember, so I stepped in again and fixed it. Picked her from work and gave her a small gift, asking her in person. Valentines day rolls in, I buy her five yellow flowers that I thought looked pretty, a vibrator, and a book that she likes but couldn't get. Everything on the date seemed alright, she seemed happy.

A week later, this sunday, she told me that she needed to talk to me, so we planned to talk on monday night as soon as I came home from college. I called her and she was crying. She told me that I should've remembered how I had to asker her to be my valentine from last year, how the flowers where the wrong color, how the flowers didn't even look like romantic flowers and just some flowers with a few leaves that I plucked from somewhere, how I should have given her a gift that she was actually waiting to recieve instead of a vibrator, etc.

At the end I just said that I will do better. To be honest, I didn't even know valentines day was so complicated, I didn't know there were so many specific rules and restrictions about what to do and what to gift. I have to ask her to be my valentine, but only if it's before valentines day and only if it's in person. I have to give her flowers, but only if they are red and only if they look like a romantic flower arrangement. I have to give her a gift, but only if it's a gift that she had previously mentiontioned that she wanted such gift and only if it can be showed to her mom.

Man... what the fuck. I'm just trying to be a good boyfriend. Where does she get all of these specific rules and restrictions? Is this like a normal thing that women expect? where do they even learn all this?from rom cons and instagram reels? I'm not trying to be sexist, I just want to know where I can read the rules of this fucking game. 

This might sound like I don't love her. I do love her and she makes super happy, I'm just tired of being told that I'm doing things the wrong way. I really thought that being romantic was about the intention, not the action within a list of parameters. So today I made a Word Document in which I wrote every detail that I remembered.

I know, kinda weird, but I really needed to have all of these valentines day rules written somewhere. I don't want her to call me crying again because I forgot to wear the appropiate shoes or because the flowers didn't have the correct number of petals. I sent her the word document so she can verify that all the rules are written clearly, and she just got more upset because ""this doesn't feel right : ( ""


I don't understand how to do better.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind responses. I needed some outside perspectice because I didn't feel like it was fair to ask her to ""lower her standards"", you know? 

Also, I genuenly wasn't trying to be sexist, I too see some instagram reels where boyfriends go absolutely romantic with their partners and I wanted to know if women make real expectations out of those. Again, thank you for your kindness.

Edit2: Okay a lot of people are asking what did she do for me on V day. She gave me a small lego set as a gift, which I liked. But the rest of the day, I was the ""lead"" on the V day date. I took her to a park with little boats that you can ride and I took her to a restaurant. I never thought she had to do something too, she always says I have to be the one who plans stuff so she doesn't have to make ""stresful decisions"" thinking about dates.

Boyfriend (20M) did something very scary to me (21F) any advice on how to handle this?,"My partner M20 recently lost a vital family member in a horrible accident. The following weeks after this I F21 took care of him as much as I could, taking time off of work to do so. About two weeks after after the passing, I was sitting in my partners bedroom and he left. I later heard a creek at the door and saw a shotgun opening the door, without seeing a face behind it I immediately got scared. Some background info: My partner knows how uncomfortable guns make me, I don’t like to see his guns, hear about them, have it at my house, etc.. it’s just my own personal feelings and opinions. He’s known this through the 4 years we’ve been together. Back to the story, I saw him emerge as well, holding up the shot gun which he previously in the week told me he inherited from the deceased family member (not pointed at me but at the wall adjacent to me). He’d asked me previously if I wanted to see it to which I declined. I was in shock and confused why he would even bring this gun in his room, but then he cocked and shot the gun straight ahead. I was about 5 feet away on the bed and it went through the wall. My eardrums were blown and I couldn’t hear, I just smelt smoke and curled up in a ball crying and I think screaming. Long story short he profusely apologized stating he did not know the gun was loaded and has never handled a shot gun before. And was incredibly sorry and seemed shocked himself. I’ve had nightmares about this ever since and loud sounds set me off. We didn’t have a further conversation about it because the scenario was pretty troublesome considering he’d just recently lost someone. I did end up talking to him about it a week or so ago, mostly wondering why he even brought the gun in the room at all to which he said he didn’t know and wasn’t thinking. This scares me a bit… he again apologized saying he didn’t deserve me and he truly didn’t know it was loaded and would never point a gun at me and it would never happen again. And that he learned from his mistake. I’m unsure if we need some time apart.. it feels conflicting because other than this our relationship has been good for the past 4 years.

EDIT: To add some info he had unloaded it earlier in the week and his dad reloaded it without his knowledge. I felt that afterwards he didn’t take it as seriously as he should’ve (the following weeks), however I’ve been struggling because of the fact that this was freshly after he lost a vital family member. He did just start therapy but I wanted to make this to see others opinions. I know this is silly but we’ve been together for so long that It’s scary to think of separating. It is more so the fact that he brought in the gun especially in the context of holding it up knowing how uncomfortable they make me. 

EDIT 2: Since this he has taken a gun safety class if that makes a difference.",1730227025.0,RevolutionaryFile305,relationship_advice
My (M32) fiancee (F32) suddenly doesn't want to marry me anymore because of a disagreement we had a year ago. What now?,"Hi everyone. I've been with my fiancee ""Lola"" for almost 7 years now and we've been engaged for 2 of those years. We have twins together (M&F, 3) and I thought we were happy.

About a year ago we had a small fight/disagreement about how she was raising our kids, but after receiving some feedback from Reddit, I was able to see that I was in the wrong and I was being incredibly offensive toward my wife (this was on a different account that I lost the info for, but everyone was very helpful so thanks again). I apologized and she seemed to accept my apology, and I thought things were back to normal after all of that. She seemed to be her normal self again and we didn't argue/disagree about that topic anymore. In fact, we hadn't had even a minor disagreement for months after that. I thought we were happy.

Well, we were originally planning to get married last year (October of 2023) but she ended up changing her mind and saying she wanted to push back the wedding a bit. I was a bit confused and she wouldn't really elaborate on why, she just said it was stressful to plan a wedding with toddlers and she needed some time so I agreed.

Well, she just dropped a bomb on me out of nowhere a few days ago when she randomly stated that she doesn't think she wants to get married anymore. This was heartbreaking to hear, of course, and I asked that we sit and talk it out. She ended up telling me that she doesn't think we are compatible (after 7 years?) and that she thinks we should go our own ways and co-parent. I'm devastated. I pressed for more information, like what made you realize this? And why now? And she basically said that she felt like I didn't really ""know"" her and that I didn't want to know her. I thought this was ridiculous! I know everything about her! I know her favorite color, movie, and song, I know her favorite food, I can read her body language extremely well! I DO know her, we've been together for years! She said a few more things and apparently, she's been thinking over our relationship since that fight happened a year ago. She said it was ""eye-opening"" for her, and that when I let her see the post and she looked through all the comments, she realized things about me that she had swept under the rug for years and blown off as one-time issues. She went on a whole schpiel about all these things she had realized about me and how she didn't think we should be together anymore.

I don't even know what she means. I think I zoned out for most of her rant because I was so blindsided and hurt by this that I was trying not to break down in tears. I offered to go to couples counseling and individual counseling but she said it was too late and that I should have done that/offered that a year ago when this all blew up. I don't even know what to do now, and I think it's a bit unfair for her to put all of that on me. Just because I didn't think of therapy after a minor disagreement A YEAR AGO I'm no longer someone she wants to marry? Thats insane.

I don't know what to do. How can I get her to give me another chance to see that I still love her and we can make this work? What can I say to make her change her mind? I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

EDIT: I think it might be a good idea to link the original post with the details of our disagreement as some people are asking for the details and accusing me of avoiding the question so the post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wdmir0/aita_for_demanding_my_fianc%C3%A9e_stop_teaching_our/)

UPDATE: (I tried to make this a new post but I couldn't get it to show up, so I think I might be doing something wrong.) Hi everyone. This will likely be the last post I make about this situation as everything seems to be final now. This one is made with my ex's permission and she will read over it beforehand, as she thinks I am an unreliable narrator.

First of all, we have broken up. She gave me back the ring even though I said she didn't have to and she could pawn it and keep the money. She didn't want to do that and gave it back to me. I think I will pawn it myself and give her the money since she has moved out of the house. She moved in with her brother and his partner, who was actually able to get her a job where he works and she is apparently starting next week. We will split our time with the kids since she said she was able to get shifts that align with my schedule (I have a pretty flexible schedule but I just prefer to work the same days/times every week) so we will trade off the kids when each of us is at work and we are going to split the weekends. We are going to get a custody agreement but we talked about it and agreed to 50/50 and we are both going to be cooperative as I don't want to stress her out and I do want to see my kids.I will also be brushing up on Mexican culture so that I am able to participate in things with my children and I am looking to take some Spanish classes as well so I can communicate with them in both languages.

I showed my wife the last post the day after I made it and she read it over and read all my comments and a lot of the other comments. She took like two days to do this. Afterward, she said she wanted to talk and asked me if I was serious when I claimed that I thought she wanted to break up because of the one fight about the food. I said yes, because I was serious and did think that, and she said she couldn't believe me. I asked her to elaborate and she got very mad and asked me if I was really so oblivious to my own actions. I realized that I probably have been oblivious to my own actions, and that I've been selfish and she kind blew up and said something and asked me if I ""needed a fucking list"" so I could see all of the shit I've been doing. I told her I would appreciate if she could communicate some of the issues, and there was no need for a list but she said that a list would probably lessen the chances of me losing focus while she went on a rant (ouch, but deserved). We ended up having a long talk about it and she wanted me to include this in the post, so I will add it below:

(Note that these are just things that happened since the fight about the food)

\-When one of her nieces had a quinceanera, I kept calling it a sweet sixteen. She said she explained to me multiple times that they were different, had different meanings, differed cultural significance, and had different practices. She said I still called it a sweet sixteen when I would talk to people about it or mention it. She said I also embarrassed her at the party because she felt that I was making fun of how her relatives were dancing.

\-I (to this day) sometimes call her Spanish instead of Hispanic/Latina/Mexican. She said there is a big difference and me slipping up and forgetting is bs.

\-When she was pregnant with the twins, I told her she could give them names that are pronounced in Spanish so that her non-English speaking family could say them easily and also since they are half Mexican. We agreed that she could, so long as I could choose which name was final. She said that I have not held up my end of the deal, and that when we were at Christmas with her family in December, I ""obsessively"" corrected her family members when they pronounced our daughter's name ""Eh-leh-na"" (Elena) and kept saying it ""Uh-lay-nuh"". According to her, I did this more than 6 times that night and she stopped keeping count.

\-I didn't 'let' her feed our kids some Mexican stew she had made because it looked spicy (I genuinely thought it was). She said she told me she hadn't used spicy peppers, but that night I fed them something else before the soup was done and she said I disrespected her and her parenting skills.

\-She feels like she is not allowed to listen to her music/any Spanish music because I will complain or change the song. She said she can only listen to her music when I am not home, otherwise I will always change it within a few seconds.

She said there were other smaller examples but these are the bigger ones that she had already mentioned/brought up before and nothing had changed. When I asked her why she stayed with me for so long or why she didn't mention these things more, she said that she's always had low self-esteem and she thought that I was a good person/partner other than these things so she always talked herself out of a break up, but she was just over it now.

The things she listed off really opened my eyes and made me realize how selfish and unaware I've been, and I know that I need to change. I apologized to her and I know it won't change her mind but that's okay, I just want her to know that I do regret my actions.

I'm not going to ignore her or grey rock her like some people were suggesting, as I want to remain amicable for our children. I want us to have good communication, as I don't want our kids to grow up with parents who hate each other and can't have a simple conversation. Thank you to everyone who left comments, especially the ones who were harsh. (I also want to correct a typo in my last post where I said we were going to get married in Oct of 2023. It should have read Oct of 2022.)",1704819599.0,ThrowRAbadmanners2,relationship_advice
"UPDATE: my son and his ""friend"" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?","I tried yo post this before but it got removed as I hadn't waited 48 hours. Hopefully this time it works!

Hello, lovely people. As promised I am back with an update for you on all what happened the other day. [Here it is, if you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Want to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) 

Okay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. ""Friend"" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face ""Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?"" 

Well, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said ""oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird"". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. 

Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!",1586279911.0,throwralovemygayson,relationship_advice
How would you split chores when wife (28F) works full time and husband (30M) stays at home? No kids ,"My partner is lucky enough to be in a financial situation where he does not have to work, due to inherited wealth. He stopped working with it the last year and currently spends his free time at his leisure. He has informed me that he can financially support both of us if I chose not to work, but we would be living a very modest lifestyle. I currently work full time and make good money relative to my field. He pays for rent but we share most other living expenses. 

Because he is at home all the time and we don't have kids, I expect him to take on the majority of household chores. He isn't in school, volunteering, or working on any projects. He is mostly scrolling or playing video games. I am happy with him not working and spending his free time as he chooses so long as he manages most of the household responsibilities. 

The most recent thing that frustrated me is I asked that he clean the bathroom before the weekend. He told me he cleaned it less than a week ago. However there was toothpaste splatter on the mirror, his hair shavings and toothpaste splatter in the sink, mildew in the shower. When I pointed this out, he said it didn't matter. I ended up cleaning the bathroom on the weekend.

How would you go about splitting household duties when one partner works full time and the other stays at home? What is a fair distribution of household labor in this situation?

My (26F) fiancé (27M) left me for his “one that got away” four years ago. They’ve divorced and he wants to get back together.,"My fiancé broke our engagement off when his high school girlfriend moved to our city. They quickly got engaged, married and had a baby before it had even been a year. I was so blindsided and hurt, I don’t think I ever really got over my ex which is why I’m making this post to get some outside insight. 

My ex reached out a few days ago to “catch up”. He claimed he regretted breaking up with me two months after he did but because his ex-wife was pregnant at the time, he felt he owed it to his son to try and make it work. He said their relationship quickly fell apart when he realized his ex wasn’t looking for a life partner but someone to financially support her. He said the financial issues is what finally led to their divorce. They’ve been divorced for 6 months and have two children together. According to him, his ex regularly tries to get back together with him, but he doesn’t want her.

He ended up asking me if I was willing to give him a second chance. 

In some ways, my ex has become my “one who got away” and I probably would’ve jumped at the chance to get back with him a few months ago. However, I’ve recently been talking to this guy and whilst we aren’t official or anything, we did go on a date two weeks ago which went really well. I feel like it could progress into something good and I don’t know if my ex is worth losing it over. 

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do in this situation. 

TL;DR – My ex left me for his “one that got away”. Four years and two kids later, they’re now divorced. My ex claims he regretted leaving me two months after he did but felt like he had to stay for the sake of his unborn child. He now wants a second chance, but I’ve met someone knew who seems like a great person. I don’t know what to do.",1600888324.0,ThrowRA1whogotaway,relationship_advice
I think I have accidentally conditioned myself (F36) to not want my husband (M39) anymore. How do I unlearn it?,"This is a throw away account, as my cousin is active in the subreddit and I prefer keeping this anonymous.  
  
Me (F36) and my husband (M39) have a one year old baby girl. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but overall everything is fine. I got pregnant really fast, and we have been together only three years. We parent our child together, support each other and everything is great on the surface. We are happy, our baby is happy.  
  
As always, there are some issues regarding our private life. He has a health issue that escalated when I was in the last stages of my pregnancy. He got a new medication that we knew would solve the issue in around a year. We had a small baby, and a lot in our minds, and a year did not seem like a long time then. We knew the meds would affect his ability to perform in the bedroom, leading him to a decision that he would prefer not to engage in anything sexual during this time. He offhandedly asked me to not initiate. In hindsight I know we should have had a proper conversation about this beforehand, but we were just so tired with a colic baby and everything. You know, learning to be parents.  
  
In the beginning I sometimes forgot. He is my husband, and I love him. He turned me down gently, like the proper gentleman he is. But still, even if I knew he had a proper medical reason, and that it was my mistake, the rejection hurt. I had a really hard time with the changes in my body, even developing a small eating disorder. I had gained a lot of weight during the pregnancy (I was really petite earlier), but I ended up losing around 60 lbs in the first three months. I still don't look the way I'd prefer, but I'm taking small steps and trying to learn to love my new mom-body. I know that struggle was partly due to feeling like even my own partner didn't want to touch me. Still, it's not his fault. And at the same time I feel guilty. It's been a year and I still don't feel good in my body. Maybe I should have tried harder, but going to a gym with a baby was not an option here. Or maybe that is just an excuse.  
  
Now my husband is finally getting off the meds. He is really excited about being able to return back to normal, and to again have a sexlife with me. But I find myself scared. I realise that after all the rejection, I think I have conditioned myself not to want him. The idea of having to have sex with him feels... I just don't want to do it. I know I could force myself to do it. You know, lie back and think of England kind of way. I know I can do it. I can. But I don't want to. And in addition there is the timing. I had a traumatic birth and they had to sew me up. The idea of having him inside of me is also a fear inducing. I don't know this body, and I don't know if forcing myself to sleep with him is the best way for myself to learn about it. I'd like to do it because I want to, not because I feel like it's my duty. Like I wanted before his medication, before being turned down again and again. God, I just want to go back to that. Back to wanting him.  
  
I feel so guilty. His final doctor appointment is next week and I'm so panicked. He is the loveliest man alive. A great father. And he loves me so much. And I know we should discuss this together, but I don't even know where to start. I feel guilty about making my daughter's life harder by not being able to do this. Because I feel like I can't do this. The whole idea is enough to make panic start to rise in my body. And I have no-one to talk about this with. My family loves him. My friends love him. Everybody loves him. And, above all, I love him. Who could I talk to? I think that is why I'm writing here, even if I feel a bit ashamed to write here about this. I'm an adult, I should know how to navigate things like this without going to strangers for advice. But I just don't know what to do. Feeling a bit lost here. Or greatly lost. So, so lost.  
  
I think I just need to know if this is normal, and how to fix it.",1728291222.0,ThrowRA_FunkoPopper,relationship_advice
Update: My (30f) husband (30m) won’t get a vasectomy and it’s taring us apart—how do we make this work?,"
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/zIEZynImhs

My original post from a year ago.

I just found this account so if anyone cares, here’s an update. 

We are weeks from our official divorce. It was a deal breaker for and a lack of care for my personal and mental well-being a new a disrespect towards what I’d given up to have our children. I couldn’t get over it. He kept trying to pretend it wasn’t as bad as it was, but inevitably much like you all said, it was his choice. And this was mine.

I am unfortunately considering filing some sort a restraining order however as he had been making accounts to ‘talk sense into me’ through most of my socials.

I actually hadn’t reread my post in a year and got to the end and had a good laugh, I am actually currently dating a lovely woman. It’s only been a few weeks but we knew each other her from college, and just reconnected a month ago.  It’s going very slow, I have twins but she’s been a saint honestly, to come back to my posts topic, It is lifechanging for my stress to know that she cannot get me pregnant, not that we been very intimate yet.

Anyway, not sure anyone cares but there it is. I’m in a much better place than I was, I feel better. My twins are happy. And we’ve been co-parenting decently well other than the social media thing.

Edit: I think I'm going to step away now. 
But my advice. **Don't let your partners use you as a humam shield for all the physical reproccussions of reproduction. Partnership is a give and take of equal sacrifices, and that’s not the case if he is all to comfortable for you to be the only one taking on the physical sacrifice. We do enough bringing children into the world. Your not expecting too much for him to be willing to take the same risks he expects of you.**

I’m happy and healthy, my twins are happy and healthy, 
thanks for all your well wishes. ",1701903125.0,ThrowRAptsdvasectomy,relationship_advice
I (28f) had a panic attack after my husband (30m) finished inside me.,"My husband and I have been discussing the idea of starting a family for quite some time now, and it's been a bit of a rollercoaster for me.

Let me give you some context: My husband is absolutely thrilled and ready to dive headfirst into parenthood. He's been excitedly talking about the prospect of having children for a while, and his enthusiasm is both heartwarming and a little overwhelming. On the other hand, I've been on the fence about it. Don't get me wrong; I love my husband dearly, and I can see a beautiful future together with a family. However, I've always had some reservations and fears about becoming a parent.

Last night, we decided to take the plunge and try for a baby for the first time. My husband's excitement was infectious, and I wanted to share in his joy and start this journey together. But shortly after our intimate moment, I was hit by a wave of panic and anxiety. It was like a sudden storm of uncertainty, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I might not be ready for this life-altering step.

I'm sharing this here because I desperately need advice, reassurance, or even just to hear from someone who's been through a similar situation. Is it normal to have doubts and fears when trying for a baby, even when you love your partner and want to start a family? How do you navigate this emotional turbulence?

My husband has been incredibly understanding and supportive, but I can't help feeling like I might be letting him down. I want to be a good partner and potential mother, but I'm struggling with my own insecurities and anxieties. Has anyone here experienced a similar panic attack or moment of doubt during their journey to parenthood?",1695736909.0,ThrowRA739249,relationship_advice
I (31/m) am in a submissive relationship with my girlfriend (28/f) and I just realized she doesn't actually love me,"My girlfriend (of 1 1/2 years) and I follow an ""FLR"" which means female led relationship. It's basically a lifestyle fetish thing. Without being too specific I basically have dedicated my life to making her happy in a seemingly selfless way (it's not really selfless I guess because I enjoy it myself, but that's all I get from it). She controls all the finances, we only do stuff if she wants to do it, we never do what I want, sex is only for her, I do all the chores, etc. The whole relationship is basically about double standards that benefit her and that don't benefit me, to put it simply. But that's just how our relationship is. I've struggled with it at times but I enjoy it overall.

I have a sciatica issue with my back. It's normally not a big deal but over the weekend I seriously screwed it up. It was totally agonizing and I had to go to the hospital. My girlfriend was completely unsupportive and didn't care about me at all. She told me to power through the pain but I was like rolling around in pain almost. It was clearly impossible. I called her by her first name by accident and she yelled at me for being disrespectful. I had to drive myself to the hospital because she wouldn't let me use the phone. She was just completely annoyed about the whole thing. I think she told me that she hopes I catch the virus but I wasn't sure. I was out of it as I was leaving the house. They gave me some muscle relaxers in the hospital and I'm doing better now, but I'm trying not to exert myself too much until the disk completely goes back into place.

Also, while she does sometimes treat me badly as part of the ""role"", she didn't seem to be doing that here. I mean she knew it was serious, and I think she just revealed exactly how she felt. I always thought that even though we had this relationship, that she did actually care about me. But because of the way our relationship was, it didn't come out much. She loved me in her own way, I thought. But these last days, I realized that she actually just views me as a literal servant. She doesn't care about me as a person, only as submissive partner. Even calling it a partnership doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is the wrong place to post this but I wanted to get a vanilla perspective with people that have normal, healthy relationships. Am I overthinking this? Do you think I might be able to make the relationship work long-term? And if you have dabbled in d/s stuff I'd be curious to hear if any of you have had similar experiences.

My current boyfriend (24M) is upset about me (22F) grieving the death of my ex boyfriend. What do I do? ,"My ex boyfriend *Toby passed away in hospital 5 days ago as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident. He was 22, I had known him since we were 13 as we went to the same school, and we dated for over a year between the ages of 18-19. It still feels very strange to talk of him in the past tense. He was my first love and first everything, we broke up amicably when we realised long distance at university wasn’t working and was taking a toll on both of us. We remained on good terms with one another though we didn’t speak nearly so much after breaking up. 

Last year I began a relationship with my current boyfriend, *Max. I love Max and he has always been communicative, emotional and empathetic which is part of the reason I love him so much, he is my emotional support. The recent news has hit me very hard, not only because it is such a shock and because he had so much of his life left to live, but because I regret not keeping in touch with him more. Toby was always quite a lonely person and I feel as though we should have stayed closer friends because I was his best friend and main support when we were dating. I can’t bear the idea of him not having a best friend there for him when he died. Needless to say I have not been myself these past few days and have been grieving his death, I spent the whole night crying when I first found out. Max was comforting at first but over the last couple of days he became reserved and moody with me which is not like him at all. For example he’d turn away from me in bed when I asked him to hold me and his general manner has been pretty cold. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he was “suprised I noticed anything was wrong since I’m so busy grieving another relationship”. I was shocked and told him I’m not grieving the relationship but a friend whom I have known for years. He told me it was “disloyal” to grieve so openly over an ex and if I was truly over my previous relationship I wouldn’t be grieving. He then essentially implied that I must have been having some sort of emotional or physical affair with Toby still or at the very least that I was still in love with him. I told Max that I didn’t have to be in love with Toby to still have love for him and care for him as a friend, meaning I have a right to grieve his death and I have a right to my emotions. He seemed to find this to be further confirmation that I was not over Toby and told me that if our relationship was “enough” then I wouldn’t be grieving. 

I am stunned by his stance on this. On the one hand I can understand it not being nice to watch your girlfriend mourn another romantic partner, but I can’t believe he is questioning our relationship or my loyalty because of it. 

What do I do? Am I out of line? Is he out of line? This ordeal has really shaken my view of him. 

*Edit: to clarify, my grieving has been me being quieter and less talkative than usual, not wanting to go out to eat or for entertainment, and not wanting to watch violent tv because I don’t want to think of or see reminders of how my friend died in pain. I keep my thoughts to myself and I haven’t asked Max for much other than to hold me at night a couple times because I felt cold and alone. I have been trying to get on with life as normal. 

*Edit 2: I want to thank most of you for your advice and perspectives, including those who think I am in the wrong and those who are offering sensible perspectives as to what Max might be feeling right now and how we can communicate with one another. I apologise that I cannot respond to you all but I have read nearly all the comments and am grateful for your opinions. And for those who are vilifying my grief, thank you for giving me the perspective that maybe Max’s reaction isn’t so bad 😂. 

It’s amazing how far people can take small details and run with them. I am not an ‘emotional wreck’ nor in a ‘deep depression’, I have got dressed, washed, gone to work at my emotionally demanding job, cooked and cleaned every day this week. I have mentioned being ‘quieter than usual’ by no means ‘cold’ or ‘distant’ as some people have reported. I have been nothing but kind to Max really and treasured his company even more so in the face of my own mortality when he was behaving normally during the first two days in the aftermath of Toby’s death. I mention not being myself because I usually expend a lot of energy catering to others and making them feel good, whereas I don’t feel I have the energy to do that at the moment. As I said, I cried only when I first found out which is a very rare occurrence for me, I only tend to cry when I am truly taken by surprise by something tragic. 

As for the assumptions about Toby, as I said, we have known each other from the age of 13 when he was in my class of 17 children at school, I would classify us as friends from that point and best friends from the age of 16 onwards. His presence was prevalent throughout my childhood. I never said we had been no contact for years, rightly, when we broke up we took some emotional distance from one another but remained in contact as friends. We used to see each other around fairly often as our childhood homes are very close. All our communication was above board - Max even follows Toby’s social media accounts. We did not break up because of logistics or location, but because we realised that our communication styles were not compatible and we were dragging each other down at a formative point in our lives. We never thought we would be ‘together forever’ and decided to make it a clean and amicable break while we could. I do not regret this and I never looked back to Toby as a potential suitor. It is only now that I wonder if despite the break up I could have been more there for him emotionally as a friend because he struggled to intimately connect with people and share his feelings. 

I am staying at my sister’s house today and will likely speak to Max in person tomorrow.",1728087263.0,h3rm1tfr0g,relationship_advice
Dad (62m) won't spend Christmas with BIL (28m) and mum (60f) is blaming my wife (36f),"This is a throwaway account as I have work colleagues on my main that I dont want to know about my family drama and spelling will be rubbish as I'm fuming right now. Obligatory all names have been changed.

So,for the back story, I 36F and married to the love of my life 36F Kay. We met when we were 17, she was out and proud whilst I was still in the closet, so we didn't start dating until I came out at 21. We got married in 2019 and have an adopted 4 year old son Jack, this comes in relevant in a minute. 

My sister 27F Sarah, has a long term boyfriend 28M Steve who the family can not stand. They've been together for 8 years and the whole family has hated him from the first time we met him. He is rude, obnoxious, arrogant and all in all a crappy human being. He's also someone that likes to claim that he is just honest, but if someone is honest back to him he flips out and sulks like a toddler, in fact my toddler is better behaved than him. He isn't abusive to Sarah and doesn't direct these comments towards her its just the rest of us, he's actually a good partner to her and treats her well which is his one redeeming quality.

My dad and Kay hate him the most and will do anything to avoid him at family gatherings. Kay usually just ignores him and brushes off anything he says to her as she doesn't like conflict. However, there have been a few occasions that she has said something back, but it's usually said in a joking manner which amuses my dad to no end. My mum is a peace keeper and will do anything to avoid drama so she just changes the topic whenever he starts, but she and my grandparents all hate him just as much as the rest of us. Sarah is the only one that obviously doesn't hate him. 

Our sons birth mother Tess was Kays best friend, who sadly died in 2021. This was a real shock as she had an underlying heart condition that she didn't know about and simply went to sleep one night and never woke up. Jack had been left alone in his cot all day screaming for his mum before Kay got worried that Tess wasn't answering her texts and went to their house to see if she was OK. She found Jack in his cot and Tess in her bed. We adopted Jack as no one in Tess's family was in a position to take him in. We raise him as our own but he knows who Tess is. Obviously this is a very sensitive topic for Kay as it was so traumatic for her and Jack.

Now, onto what happened last weekend. It was the anniversary of Tess's death on Saturday, so Kay, Jack and I went to visit her grave. Kay is always quiet after going to see her and this time of year is especially hard for her. On Sunday we had a family gatherings at my parents house. These happen every couple of months as just a catch up for everyone. 

At first nothing was out of the ordinary. Kay and my dad were off to the side talking as usual, only I could see that Kay was obviously struggling so my dad and her went for a walk so she could clear her head, this is something they have done before so nothing too unusual. However, Steve had an issue with this and asked why they had left and why he wasn't invited to walk with them. I explained that about Tess and Kay just needed a minute. This wasn't good enough for Steve though and he said she should have gotten over it by now. At this my Grandad, who is naturally a very quite guy, said that his best friend had died over 20 years ago and he still had days where his missed him so much it hurt, you don't just get over something like that. Steve shut at that.

Kay and my dad got back and she was in a much better mood. We all sat down at the table for our late lunch and started chatting. Everything was fine at first until Steve started trying to butt into Kays conversation with my grandad. When it was obvious that they wern't going to include him he very loudly stated, this is bullshit, she's getting all the attention of everyone because her friend died 3 fucking years ago. Get over it for fuck sake were all sick of hearing about it.

The whole table went silent and I took one look at Kay and knew she was about to go off on Steve. Only it didn't happen the way I thought. Rather than exploding at him she looked at him very calmly and said that her and grandad wernt talking about Tess, they were making plans to take him to the Christmas Markets, but if he want to be a dick then no problem. 

She then went on to say to him that everyone in the family hates him because he's a toxic, narcissistic fuckwad. That whenever he can't come to a family gatherering the whole family is much happier. That there is a reason he has no friends and that his own family can't stand to be around him. That reason is that he's rotten from the inside out and that Tess may have only been on this planet for 32 years, but she made a bigger impact on people that he would if he live untill he was 150. That her funeral was rammed with people because she was so loved, where as he'd be lucky if anyone other than Sarah was at his. 

After that she got up and went to the back garden and I followed her. A few minutes later my dad came out and said that he'd told Sarah and Steve to leave. We went back inside and Kay apologised to everyone and said she should have just kept her mouth shut. Everyone other then my mum told her what she had done was right and it was about time someone told him. My dad then found it hilarious that a lesbian had been the one to tell him straight which lightened the mood alot.  

We spent the rest of the afternoon there before going to pick Jack up from Kays mums house as she had had him overnight on Saturday for us. 

The reason I'm making this post is that yesterday I got a call from sarah saying that her and Steve wanted an apology from Kay or they wern't going to Christmas. When i reminded her that we wouldn't be at Christmas either as it our year to spend it with Kays mum so it made no difference to us, she got really upset saying that she wanted an apology because Kay was way out of line. I said she wasn't and that I wouldn't even contemplate asking her to apologise because I agreed with everything she said and so did everyone else there. She ended the call and I just went back to work.
 
Then today my dad called me and asked if Kays mum would mind a few more for Christmas as he was refusing to spend it with Steve so he and my grandad needed someone else to go. Apparently after Sarah had called me she is called mum and started ranting and my mum had told my dad to get Kay to apologise which he said no to and they had an argument and my dad has now decided that he's done with Stave even if that affects his relationship with Sarah. He's not having it anymore. My mum wants Sarah there, and she won't go without Steve so my dad is going somewhere else and my grandad agreed with him. I text Kays mum and she said they were welcome so now my mum is furious and saying that my dad and Kay are ripping the family apart. 

So basically this has turned into a shit show. Kay has said she will apologise if I want her to, just to keep the piece but I've told her no way. Everything she said was true. I just dont know where to go from here and the people in my life all hate Steve that much that Kay could have physically attacked him and they would all still think she is in the right. So, that's why I'm asking internet strangers who might have had to deal with difficult family members. What can we do to get into a place where we can be around each other amicably? I'm struggling to see a way right now.

"My (31M) gf (30F) said she had the ""best sex ever"" with another man in front of me. How do I proceed?","Oof, this one was tough to hear. I am not sure whether I should continue to address this or just move on and push forward in the relationship.

I have been with my partner for about 7 months - still relatively new. I am happy in the relationship and she is too. We have pretty good, open and honest communication.

So, I was at a party with my girlfriend this weekend. We were all relatively drunk, and her friends brought up her taking a guy back to their AirBNB and I guess having some pretty vocal sex. She was drunk and just went ""it was the best sex ever!"" while, unfortunately, I was standing right there.

We were drunk and cabbing back to her place and I think I got pretty rattled and asked her what was it. She did explain to me, in detail what it was. I do appreciate the openness and we have had a good relationship with pretty open and honest communication thus far.

Now look - I know in a relationship people have pasts, and sex is a journey. We have good sex, and she reassured me that she loves sex with me.

But man this sucked to hear. I'm honestly not super angry about it but I am definitely ruminating on it. I could choose to never bring it up again. I could choose to work on improving our sex life and getting to an amazing spot and being thankful for her honesty. But I could also choose to end it, although that seems aggressive for a one off comment.

I feel kind of lost and am wondering if I should just move on from this or continue to bring it up.

  
EDIT/UPDATE: Gonna keep this thread open and post an update in 30 days. Talking to my therapist in 18 days. Honestly, the approach I am planning to take is to focus on myself for the near future. I am not going to end things because of one drunken comment. If I see patterns or signs of continued disrespect though I will make a choice and leave. So far, I've seen honesty and trustworthiness in the relationship, even with things she felt uncomfortable sharing. I do love her. This absolutely hurt my ego, and she did not think before she spoke, but I think a lot of the woman's perspectives in here were helpful (she probably just blurted it out cause the girls were ribbing her) and some of the male perspectives were good too (get over yourself and get better).

That will be the approach I take VS just giving up.",1730239755.0,throwRA697891,relationship_advice
[update] My(M30) wife(F26) has returned 1 year after leaving to find herself. How stupid am I for considering taking her back?,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/197qy87/mym30\_wifef26\_has\_returned\_1\_year\_after\_leaving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/197qy87/mym30_wifef26_has_returned_1_year_after_leaving/)

For the people that want the short answer, I’m not going to try to work through things.

Let me explain. I saw many, many, many comments suggesting that she’d been dating, “hoeing” around, even some indicating she’d gotten pregnant? False. Like she said, she went to heal and I believe her. Because when I tell you she was depressed, I mean it got to a point where I had to make sure someone was in the house at all times just to make sure she didn't kill herself. And I don’t feel like arguing on that topic with people that don’t know her.

I’d been thinking too fairytale like when I saw her. Probably because that's how our story has been. Fell in love quick, married young, and thought it was together forever. When I’d seen her for the first time in such a long time, I saw my wife. The woman I fell in love with, my best friend, and my life partner. That’s who I instantly saw. But one quick good look in the mirror and a few days of thinking about it got me realizing that the same woman I married was not the same woman who left me.

This past year has taught me and I had to think back to how I was feeling the previous day before she showed up. I felt very good that past day. I spent the day with my son before dropping him to his mom’s, I went to a bar with friends, and slept peaceful at my own home. My wife hadn’t crossed my mind at ALL that entire day. I’d been happy beyond that past day.

There is only one other person in my life right now that I need. My son. He’s the reason I keep going everyday. And for the quick moment I considered trying things out with my wife, it was incredibly selfish towards him. I mentioned this before, but he truly is a great boy.

I still have love for her and I’m happy that she’s alright, but we’re over. I told her this. We went out and spoke about everything for hours. We finally cleaned out everything from the nursery, she got most of her stuff, she'll be back soon to get the rest. She’ll always be apart of my story, there’s no erasing her or the love we had. What we had was magical at one point, but our story together end’s at divorce.

As for me. Life's only moving, and I gotta make the best of it. So far I have been and it's been going good.",1706745902.0,throwratu449,relationship_advice
My(26M) gf(24F) told me she is pregnant but I am sterile,"I am from a SEA country and my first language is not english.

Backstory: I got into an accident after my college and will never be able to have kids. None of my family members know of this. They know about the accident but not about this. I have always wanted to be childfree so it did not affect me much mentally.

I have finished my Masters Degree last year and never dated before. I got a very high paying job directly through campus placements. My parents immediately wanted me to get married after getting a job but I wanted to work on myself and explore a bit. They said no and I said that it was my wish. All my life I did what they wanted and for the first time when I talked against them, they were not happy. This was last year and they gave up after covid started.

So I picked up some dating apps and went through them but no luck. Then my parents introduced me to a family friends daughter and we clicked kinda. Looking back, I was a fool. She said yes to anything I said and never complained about anything. I felt kinda weird about it. I wanted her to express her interests but she always said she was interested in whatever I do. Well, i did not think much about it.

I said that i wont have kids ever and she surprisingly said ok. I was like damn, she is probably the one as it is very hard to find a partner who is childfree in my country (or atleast i thought), but we were in the initial stages and I have not told about my accident. Long story short, we had sex a month ago, i used condoms because safety first. The next day on, she started ghosting me a bit. I thought it was due to my performance in bed and wanted to give her some space. Then she texted infrequently and only replied OKs and Ks and one line answers. I thought maybe she wanted to end the relation and was sad but left it at that.

Yesterday, all her family came to my house and she claims shes pregnant and the father is me. Needless to say, I freaked the fuck out and wanted to collapse on the ground. I did not say anything while they were talking about marriage and stuff that needs to happen because I got her pregnant.

Please advice me on what steps to take now reddit

UPDATE: Let me start off by saying im very very grateful for all the redditors who took their time to read and give me advice. I was overwhelmed by the amount of comments and how many of you said it might not even be my kid. Looking at it from a different perspective gave me much more insight on the whole situation. I called my boss and took today off.

I called up some clinics to get tested and was given a slot on Friday afternoon. Then I went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests and asked only her to come to my place tomorrow ( i.e today morning). I also called my parents and my before I said anything, my mom asked me if I had any good news, I was shocked by what she said and asked me what exactly she was talking about. She then played dumb and I knew that the situation was more fucked that I thought. I cut the call and cried all night till 3am, grown ass man crying for the first time since 8th class. 

She came today morning with her parents even after I told her to come alone. They were under the impression that I was gonna discuss engagement plans with them. I told them to wait outside and called her in and they threw a fit. I told they can all go back or let her alone come in, they said ok. 

I took out the pregnancy tests and gave it to her and told her to prove that she was actually pregnant and told her where the bathroom was. She started screaming at me(never done this before, I was shocked at this), then she went out the door and called her parents in. Now everyone is screaming at me in my own home because I asked her to prove the pregnancy not even a DNA test. I told them all to fuck off and one hour later my parents and they all came to my home and they spilled the beans. She was never actually pregnant(as many redditors said), my parents were afraid that I was getting old for marriage and wanted me to marry and give them grandchildren. They said that in arrange marriages, no need for the people to actually get to know the spouse because parents choose only the best for their kids. They planned this all and were only waiting for me to have sex with her to do this. I broke down and cried again. All my life, I did exactly what my parents wanted, always scored high and never asked for anything. I told them to get out and never talk to me again in between crying and they said parents know whats best for their kids and I should do what they say. Then I got extremely angry and told them to fuck themselves in my native language which was very bad. For once, I think they knew I was serious with them and they all left. I blocked them all before sending my parents a message to never again contact me in my life even if one of you is dying. 

Cried for some more time, went through some dog videos and went through all my messages on reddit and I feel like I owe you guys this update because it was you guys who helped me do this. That is all and I hope you have a wonderful day.",1600180924.0,ThrowRA_sterile,relationship_advice
"(Update) I (35m) was incarcerated and lost touch with (33f). I contacted her, and she responded.","Previous post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA9478385939/comments/10m65ze/i_35m_was_incarcerated_and_lost_touch_with_33f/). The short version is that I was wondering whether I should try to contact my former girlfriend after I went to prison for a long time. The consensus was that I should, and people gave very good advice on how to do that.

First, I want to say thank you to everyone who offered advice or kind words. I had spent so long feeling ashamed about my situation, and expecting most people to react very negatively if they knew. I had barely discussed it with anyone before, except my dad and people whose job it is to help me (lawyers, therapist, etc.), and I was very surprised to be met with so much compassion from a bunch of complete strangers. Thank you, truly. Several people asked for an update, and that’s the least I can do in return.

I sent Daria a message the evening after I made my post. It was something like: «I don’t mean to intrude, but I wanted to say hello and thought I would give you my new contact information in case you ever felt like getting in touch. If not, that’s completely fine too.» I left her my mobile number and email address, wished her well, and that was that. I knew it might be a while before she responded, if she responded at all. So I tried to put it out of my mind.

Early monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number from the country where Daria lives. Who else would ever be calling me from there? I panicked a little bit, but I managed to answer in time.

She asked a few times if it was really me, and I couldn’t tell if she was laughing or crying. At first she called me by the very affectionate version of my name she used to. But then she quickly apologised and corrected herself, which broke my heart a little bit. It was an awkward phone call, but not in a bad way. I was extremely nervous, and it seemed like she was too. But happy, also.

Some of you mentioned that Daria would want to know that I was safe, and this was more true than I could have guessed. Because unrest in my country increased a lot during the last year I was in prison, she was afraid that they would decide to quietly kill me rather than let me go. There are documented cases of other prisoners like me having met very suspicious ends in the months before my release, so it wasn’t a totally unreasonable worry. 

She also said she repeatedly tried to send me parcels of supplies and put money on my commissary account, but her attempts were rejected without explanation. After my sentencing, I was not allowed to receive correspondence or to have a commissary account at all, because of the classification of my crimes, so she was forced to give up. She told me this as an apology, as if I would have been disappointed with her for not helping me more. I had no idea she had done any of that. I do know that it was not a safe thing for her to do, and I feel terrible that she put herself at risk trying to make me a little more comfortable.

She didn’t seem to want to talk about what happened any more than that, and so we didn’t. We changed the subject to more lighthearted things: our jobs, the cities where we live, how my dad is adapting to a new country, etc. When she arrived at work and had to end the phone call, she asked if I wanted to continue talking through a messaging app. Obviously I said yes, and downloaded it immediately. We sent messages throughout the day, and she even interrupted her commute home to send me a picture of a restaurant modelled after one of my favourite books, just because she thought I would like it. She told me that she thought of me every time she saw it, but unfortunately the restaurant itself was not so good. I was afraid she wouldn’t remember me, but she even remembers the things I liked to read? She remembers a lot of little things, even stuff I forgot.

We have been sending messages back and forth ever since, and talking on the phone after I finish work at night, until she gets too sleepy. Sometimes it feels like I’m 24 and she’s texting me from a few blocks away, as if the next thing she might ask is what’s for dinner. Other times it seems like we’re trying to will dead versions of ourselves back to life in order to avoid acknowledging what we’ve lost. She seems a lot more timid than she used to, more passive, which I suppose makes sense. Sometimes I worry about how much I’ve changed, and that maybe she won’t find anything left in me that’s worthy of her. But if I could express in words what it feels like to hear her laugh, I could explain that there’s also a lot that we know very well. She hasn’t lost her kindness, or her warmth, or her empathy. She still cares about me, and I still care about her. I know that rebuilding a friendship after all that’s happened will take lots of patience, and I have plenty to spare. I’m just happy to have the chance to get to know her again. 

This morning, Daria asked if I want to have a video call sometime this weekend. I agreed, but I’m ashamed to admit that as much as I want to see her, I’m very nervous. I look so different than she would remember. My jaw is messed up, and I have the teeth of a hockey player. (Fortunately, I will qualify for healthcare insurance soon and be able to have it fixed.) I lost weight that I haven’t put back on, and I see an old man in the mirror. I’m also worried that I will get very emotional when I see her, and embarrass myself that way. I don’t really cry in front of people. I’m not used to it, and this doesn’t seem like a good occasion to start. Aside from not wanting to appear pitiful, I don’t want her to feel forced to comfort me. If anyone has some advice on how to handle this, it would be much appreciated.

Overall, this week could not have gone better, and I am extremely grateful to everyone who gave me the little push of courage I needed to send her that message. A thousand times, thank you.

TL;DR: I sent a message to my former partner, she was thrilled to receive it, and we have been happily getting to know each other once again.

Edit: Just to clarify, she doesn’t have a husband or kids. As I said in my first post, I only considered contacting her because there was no evidence of a partner on her social media. But I understand that my first post wasn’t visible for a while, so I can see why that may not have been obvious. Sorry for the confusion.",1674735188.0,ThrowRA9478385939,relationship_advice
I (42f) got home from a weekend trip with my son (18m) and his girlfriend (18f) and found two wet towels in our bedroom/bathroom and a pink hair elastic that is definitely not mine. My boyfriend (48m) says it’s not his…,"I just got home from a weekend trip with my son last night. As I was unpacking my things I went into our closet and on the floor was a semi wet towel. I picked it up and threw it in over the basket and tossed my clothes from my suitcase inside the basket. I then went into the bathroom and put away of my toiletries. While I was doing that, I found a second wet towel hanging on the back of the door, where we usually put them to dry before we throw them into the laundry. Both of these towels were wet the towel I used to dry my hair on Friday night before I left was also hanging there and it was dry. On my bathroom counter next to my lotion and my hairbrush was a little pink elastic band. This is the second time I have come home from a trip and there were two wet towels in my bathroom. The first time the wet towel was on my bathroom floor and smelled a little bit of urine, he said to me “ hey the towel on the floor is because I accidentally left the door open and got the floor wet” he then snatched it up and stuck it in the washing machine immediately. 
He had not showered yet when I got home he was still in his work clothes and I was only gone Saturday and Sunday night. 
I do not use elastics in my hair at all. I use a no tangle no pull hair band in a blonde color that matches my hair. 
I have never owned a pink elastic. My sons girlfriend has never been in our bathroom we have a full guest bath in the guest bedroom and she also has long hair and uses “ouch less” plastic hair ties. 
I ask him if he had started using hair elastics last night to see what he would say.. he is mostly bald, and he responded “What! It’s not mine?” Instead of the laugh I expected. 

Did he have a lady over while I was away? Should I ask and be that jealous of woman?
Should I just assume the extra towel is because he is careless when I’m not home and got the floor wet again and the elastic somehow got into our home coincidentally?

Help.

Edit: as commented below in response to a user asking me to link roll the towel and then deciding that although that’s a bit crazy what could it hurt -

I went home on my lunch break and lint rolled the towel…
Only had little hairs probably his and grass on it.. he did mow the lawn Saturday and probably used this towel to wipe off all his sweat before he ate because it was 105 degrees on Saturday. 
I now feel like an asshole and am upset with myself for even asking this question because of a pink hair elastic that he could have and probably did pick up from the floor and put with my things because he assumed it was mine. 

I will be just straight up asking him when I get home from work. If he denies or acts sketchy I will move out. That simple. I do know how to love myself I just get really concerned that I am over reacting due to past trauma. Thanks for all of the advice you are all amazing.

Edit 2:  Because why?
1. The amount of angry people asking why I posted this to ask for advice is so confusing to me. Why are you all so mad that I made a post asking for advice in a forum that has willing participants giving advice? 
2. It is not helpful to tell people that they are wasting time posting on the internet for advice when the last word they said was literally “Help” please think about the impact of your words on people.
3. The person who posted earlier that he couldn’t believe a 40 year older wasn’t “smarter than this” I can’t find your post atm to comment but sir, everyone has strengths and weaknesses and saying I am not intelligent enough for my age was probably meant as an insult, but I am going to inform you that everyone grows differently emotionally there is no age limit on learning. If you can’t be kind, why even say anything at all? I can’t believe anyone would come at a stranger with malice just for asking for advice.",1689086405.0,Victoria525,relationship_advice
My (29F) husband (27M) is so irresponsible I’m scared to have kids with him. How do I help him understand how serious this is? ,"My husband (27M) of three years, together for 8, is so irresponsible that I have a genuine fear of him burning down our house, letting our cats out, and leaving our house open for any stranger to walk into. 

It has gotten to the point that as we are starting to want children, I am becoming terrified of having children with him for the simple fact that he is negligently irresponsible. 

Here are just a few examples of how he has showed me how irresponsible he his:

- I once had to leave work hours early and drive 30 minutes home because he left not one, not two, but FOUR candles burning in our house with 3 cats running around. He couldn’t leave work to check and “just wanted the house to smell good” when I came home. 

- Just last week when I woke up for work around 6am, our front door was wide open and unlocked. There’s a glass door that was closed so cats were okay, but that door also wasn’t locked. He said it “wasn’t a big deal.” To me, as some who had nightmares about people breaking in and he knows that, it was a big deal. 

- He “cleaned” out our basement by taking all of the cardboard boxes (just moved in a couple months ago) and surrounding our 50 year old electric heater. Then argued with me why I didn’t tell him to move them elsewhere sooner. (That is in a back room and I figured he recycled the boxes.) 

- He will also do minor things like leave the windows open when he leaves (our cats have ripped through windows and escaped at our old home), leave water running in the sink for hours on end (for the cats), plug power strips into power strips, leave on all the lights for hours on end while he isn’t home, leave food out that our cats could choke or be poisoned from, he forgets to turn the oven lock on after using it (our cats have turned the oven on multiple times from this), and multiple other minor things. 

I understand being forgetful, but some of this stuff is a big deal to me and the safety of us in our home. Not to mention running up utility bills an ungodly amount. 

When I talk with him about these things, he gets defensive or bushes them off as “no big deal.” 
- He doesn’t think the bills are too high (he doesn’t have a job and he lost it for literally being irresponsible). 
- He doesn’t think anyone will break into our home (we live in a big city and only have lived here for a few months). 
- He doesn’t believe the cats will escape since they “like our new house” (they have escaped in this exact way before). 

Since we have been talking about having children lately, I have brought all of these examples up as reasons why I am nervous to do so. He wants kids badly and blows up on me about how none of these things are reasons why we shouldn’t have kids. 

He says that “having children brings about a greater sense of responsibility” and that by having a child he will inherently become more responsible. Like an automated response. I’m sure that’s true in a small sense, but with all of the irresponsible things he does on a daily basis, my gut feeling is that he will NOT become more responsible automatically. I don’t think he actually cares or thinks enough about it. 

I don’t know how to further the conversation and help him to understand why all of this is the main reason I don’t want kids right now. I’m always seen or be nagging or overreacting about the situations. 

I’m not sure which route to go to get it through his head that while I love him, I can’t morally feel comfortable bringing a child into our home at this time. I just don’t trust him to be responsible for a child’s safety at this time. 

How can I help cement this fact to him and bring him to understand that his actions do have impact on my trust of him and trusting him to be a safe figure around our child? 

TLDR: Husband is financially and morally irresponsible. Could have burnt down our house on multiple occasions. Leaves the opportunity for strangers to just walk into our home overnight. I’m not trusting of his responsibility and he only sees my issues as “nagging” or “overreacting.” I don’t want kids with him until he can prove he can be responsible for a child’s safety. How do I get him to really understand where I’m coming from? 

EDIT:
Some people are mentioning ADHD, and I thought I’d clear up that he does in fact have ADHD, as do I. He doesn’t take medication because he has bad PSTD from issues it caused when he was a child when he first started taking medication. To add, I also think he has some kind of CTE from years of playing sports. I have tried to get him to go to therapy or counseling but he doesn’t believe in it nor do we have the money for therapy. Also, he isn’t stupid but he’s not the smartest person I know. He’s very intelligent in some respects, but as noted above, very incompetent in others. 

As for his job, he just lost it two weeks ago. It’s not like he’s been jobless forever. The job he had he had been working for 4 years before he was let go. It was a high paying managerial position and he was good at it. It was a one time mistake that was against company policy and resulted in him losing his job. I think a lot of his interpersonal issues are a result of him losing a job he enjoyed and was good at. People at his workplace were very upset he was fired and even reached out to me because of that. 

For those asking why I married him and how I hadn’t seen these things in the past, these instances have only really started showing the last couple of years since we moved in together three years ago. Contrary to what some people say in the comments, he does a lot of the cleaning in the house and cooks every meal. His job was a normal 9-5 and mine usually is 10-6 or 10-7 so I usually come home to a clean house and dinner. It’s only occasionally these negligent issues come up but it is enough to make me nervous. 

As for why I love him and have stayed with him, he is great at a lot of things. He is loved by many people and is a staple figure of growth and positivity in many peoples lives. He is a good leader and good partner aside from the things I have mentioned in this post. This post only contains his worst qualities and doesn’t touch on any of his good ones. 

I think he just really needs help, and I don’t know how to provide that help to him. ",1731530882.0,RAthrowadooraway,relationship_advice
Wife (38F) got us (39M & 38F) kicked out of my brother's (35M) house over the holiday. Because she asked what kind of mother & doctor my sil (36F) was for not getting stronger painkillers for my nephew.,"Throw away because some friends know my account and I'd rather not have this embarrassment go any further than it has too. And for obvious reasons, I'm using fake names. It's late and I'm going going to get right to the details. My brother Andrew, host Christmas this year on Christmas Eve for our side of the family. And the plan was myself and my sister would go to our partners respective families in Christmas day. 

My nephew/andrew son is recovering from a fall down the stairs to his basement. Jake has a cut down his side and bruised ribs. During the night, Jake asked his mom if he can bring his chair from his room because it's more comfortable to sit on & doesn't hurt when getting up. Andrew went to get it for him. His fall happened a week prior to Christmas eve. My sister Dana, didn't really know the story of what happened exactly. So she asked Zoe (Andrews wife/nephews mom) what happened/how did they deal with it. My brother said it was a good thing Zoe was her because he was freaking out with the blood. Zoe works in the ER room as a doctor. She even commented that it wasn't easy because it's different when it's your kid that's hurt. My wife (just call her, Amy) then asked Zoe what type of pain killers Jake has. 

She said she didn't prescribe them and even if she could. They won't give him anything too strong for something like this because of his age. She said he just needs to rest up and let her bandage his wound. My wife pushed on saying that he's clearly uncomfortable getting up and sitting down. Can't Zoe just write him a prescription. Zoe said it doesn't really work that way. 

Then my wife decided to say ""What type of mother won't break the rules for her son?"". And all hell broke loose. I was modified. My wife and I started getting into it instantly. I was trying to get her to apologise. Dana and her boyfriend took Jake out of the room. And after some words, Zoe told us both to get out. I was told after the fact that Zoe was crying when we left because of the comment. To say Andrew is angry is an understatement. He is furious. He told me that my wife isn't welcome back, ever. 

My wife and I have been fighting non stop ever since. We're sleeping in different rooms. She won't apologise because she is the most stubborn person I have ever met when it comes to just being wrong. She feels embarrassed but when she's embarrassed she doubles down. 

I need some help because it is just so bad in this house right now and she just don't budge on even remotely offering an apology.",1703671646.0,throwRA362736363,relationship_advice
"I [36M] surprised wife [32F] by coming home early only to find another man [21?M] in our home late. Is this 'monkey branching"" or just my difficult past influencing me?","Edit: Update here

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1cxj28g/update\_i\_36m\_surprised\_wife\_32f\_by\_coming\_home/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cxj28g/update_i_36m_surprised_wife_32f_by_coming_home/)

TLDR: Recently learned the term 'monkey branching’ and I can’t tell if what happened last night is my spouse doing some form of this. My past trauma is certainly clouding my judgement, so I need help.

Background: Partner (32F) and I (36M) have been together just over 8 years. Married with one child. Mostly a very love filled relationship, we had our disagreements but they always ended with some form of care and compassion and compromise or resolution. Both independent, educated, swap between working and stay at home parent. Both have full time careers in medical field and each our own side businesses we run from home. I have no reason to distrust her.

Recent past: during pregnancy and after our first child we had some major disagreements and we had an enormous lost of trust and communication between us. She was later diagnosed with PPD/PPA and started medication, and both started marriage counseling recently. We both having feelings of being hurt, disrespected, unheared and unloved by the other. Both are 100% valid, we hurt each other. I have doubts that she loves me in the same deep way she used to but I'm willing to trust her when she tells me. I’ve voiced this to her often recently.

Everything seemed to be moving forward until I came home last night

I should back up: she went on a day long hike yesterday with some friends to go foraging. One of which was a coworker (21?M). Young kid, works on the floor with her as a nurse. It's overnight shifts, so they have a lot of time to hang around the nursing station. I know they talk, I know they talk on messenger, I have no problems with my wife having friends, any flavor. 

He had come over a couple times before hikes and seemed pretty shy and nervous around me but he's a kid, seemed cool. A few weeks ago my wife had to wait for the pharmacy to open up to pick up her pills (she ran out), so in order to wait, they went hiking up a mountain together after work. But when got home she had forgotten her to actually go get her pills, and had to make the 2hr RT drive to get them the next day. Something didn't feel right.

Anyway, back to yesterday and her hike with friends out foraging. He, the kid, came by in the morning, so they could carpool. My lovely wife gave him a couple books (on foraging, etc) as gifts when he arrived, it seemed a little awkward receiving them. They took off, brought our child to the babysitter and went foraging, he left his car at our place.

When I got home from work, I decided I wanted a little time to myself and for the first time in ... 2? years I threw sleeping back and pad in a backpack and went out cowboy camping on top of my favorite local peak. Texted my wife that I wouldn’t be home tonight and I'd see her in the morning. Honestly the hike and peak was awesome, read my book, smoked a joint with some kids having a fire on the other lookout, was really fun and I felt great.

Then my sleeping pad deflated. I didn't bring a fucking patch kit. So that sucks ass but it's only 9pm, I'll just come down, scoot home and go see my wife. We had just missed being intimate the last week, lots of hugging and touching and lead up but timing didn't work, and so instead of texting her I thought I'd surprise her.

She had texted me earlier, around 7pm, that she was back home, and that by 8pm our kid was down sleeping, she was back up with all her mushrooms and ramps and stuff. Sent pictures, looked like an awesome day.

When I pulled in the driveway, around 9:45pm? the kid's car was still parked in the driveway. Bit odd he stayed around for the hour it took while my wife put our kid to bed and couple hours more together after that. I came inside and it really didn't seem like anything was off. He was still awkward and my wife was a bit talkative, but she had a great day and wanted to talk about it and I like to hear about it. They had a microscope out on the table with specimens around. Nothing suspicious at all honestly but I felt something deep in me.

I was sweaty and gross so I excused myself and took a shower. Here, I have to probably relay some trauma, my only other serious adult relationship ended in betrayal when my partner (25F) fell for a much younger man (19M), a coworker who she told me I had nothing to worry about. She told me he had feelings for her but it wasn't mutual. He wasn't her type, he was short, artist type and she preferred men like me, tall, less flighty, more masculine. I trusted her.

In a horrifying series of events, I would learn from a friend that my past partner and the previous kid were seen together and she had spent the night as his place. I was out of town at the time. Between the time I learned of them together and the day before I was able to come home, she had been killed in a car accident. I came home expecting to seek answers for things I had heard, only to find she was gone forever.

It fucked me up for years, probably permanently, which is why I'm coming to reddit strangers for advice.  
I don't think I can be a good judge of this current situtation because of my past. I think it hits me too hard from a place I can't understand. With all the similarities, it is just a lot.

So needless to say, coming out of the shower I had a lot of feelings but I kept composed. I absolutely do not want to discourage my wife from having friends or enjoying hobbies with those friends. And I trust her.

When I came out to the kitchen to eat with them and chat,  his car was pulling out of the driveway. I guess he had to get his mom's car home by 3am? That's what my wife said, which I found a weird thing to say. He could leave by 2am then... thats not a reason for leaving right now but whatever, I’m going insane inside and maybe can’t understand why that was said.

Wife and I chatted, I think she could tell something was off. She offered a massage but honestly I really didn't feel like being touched. I think I was having a bit of anxiety. She asked whats wrong and I told her I think some my of past is fucking with me. She asked if it was because he was over so late, after our kid was asleep. I said yes.

I asked if she had feelings for him, she said ""no""  
I asked if he had feelings for her, she said ""I don't know""

I pressed her on it because, in my opinion, my wife has a (eternally frustrating) habit of trickle-truthing when she knows it's something I don't want to hear.

And then she said, in a long string:

""*he's just a dumb young kid, he doesn't know what he's doing, i don't even think he likes mushrooms, i think he just likes being around me, but i don't find him attractive. at all. like at all. he’s not my type. your my type. (my name). i don't. i love you and only you*”

I should say I did really feel like she was being honest. But she did know the kid had feelings for her. But she's right, he's young and dumb and probably doesn't understand what he's attempting to do. But he is attempting it, and she knew it.

Then I realized that had my sleeping pad not blown and I had come home, it’s possible I could have never known what happened or if he was there or how long or anything. That sent me spiralling inside a bit.

After more discussion, to her defense, she said things like ""I was uncomfortable too having him over that late"", though I'm not sure what to think. 

Again, I don't want to stop my wife from having friends or ruin her relationships with coworkers. And my past might be playing a nefarious role in my gut shooting up the fucking bat signal screaming at me that my relationship is damaged beyond repair, and my wife is entertaining other men, seriously or unseriously as a response to that.

Am I right to be distraught over him being over so late, the only night I’m ever gone, when she kinda-sorta-knew he had feelings for her? 

I'm feeling pretty fucked today but can't tell if its from today or just reliving back then.

edit: theres no way I can respond to all these but for the vast majority, thank you. a lot. i just read a lot of helpful things. a lot of vastly different things honestly but i guess thats to be expected

i still know i can't think straight right now. i feel stretched over two extreme positions and its really hard to make sense of this. my body is extremely sore i think ive been tense all day

she comes home in an hour with our daughter. i know she will want to talk but honestly i don't think i physically can. i think i'll just play with the little one and go to bed with her. anyway, thanks. i do appreciate the sincerety and compassion in many of your responses, including the ones telling me to wake the fuck up. i will, i got to get to sleep first",1715001625.0,makemyweekbetter,relationship_advice
My (25F) boyfriend (28m) says my boundary is controlling,"My (25f) boyfriend (28M) says my boundary of not wanting to be with someone who goes to strip clubs is controlling. I’ve explained to him several times that my ex of 3 years had multiple relations with several strippers, and as such it is a hard limit. He said he is grown man, and he can do whatever he wants and doesn’t have to follow the rules of someone else. I said I agree, you’re absolutely allowed to do whatever you want, but I won’t be in a relationship with someone who cannot put my feelings over seeing another woman naked/getting a lap dance. I told him this before things even got serious with us, and he said he didn’t want to go to one anyways, so it was fine and he understood. Now all of a sudden, I’m trying to control him. I don’t think I am. I never said “you’re not allowed to go to a strip club,” I said it was a boundary of mine, and if it is something he feels he needs to do, then we can just go our separate ways. It wasn’t even a threat, because we weren’t even serious. He brought it up a few days ago, that he wants to go for his friend’s birthday. I reminded him of my boundary, that he agreed to because we became exclusive, and he told me that his boundary was not to be with someone who controls him. 

I said “I’m not trying to control you, but if that’s a boundary for you, that’s fine and we can end things now. My boundary will not change.” He replied that he doesn’t want to end things. And I just reiterated that he can’t go to a strip club and also have me. It’s just a hard boundary I don’t foresee myself ever going back on. I feel like he is trying to push me to throw my boundary out the window, but I know for a fact I won’t feel good about it. We’ve only been together for 6 months, so at this point I really think it would just be less of a headache of cut things off. I care about him, but I’m not interested in being a “cool” girlfriend who pretends I’m totally fine with something I find extremely disrespectful. He thinks I’m being irrational, I think it’s kind of messed up he is trying to push against something, again, I warned him about before agreeing to be his girlfriend. Thoughts?

TLDR: Boyfriend wants to go to a strip club against my hard boundary, but doesn’t want to break up to do so, and says I just shouldn’t be controlling.



!!UPDATE!!

I got sick of commenting the same thing over and over again. He came over, we spoke and he said he was definitely 100% going, a private room was booked, he was getting lap dances, and I’d just have to be okay with it. I told him I was not okay with it, and if he really wanted to go I wouldn’t stop him, but I also wouldn’t continue the relationship with him. He knew I considered it cheating, and was basically asking my permission to cheat on me. I broke up with him in the end, he called me crazy (something he know is a trigger), and left. About an hour after the break up he was calling and texting me. His texts flip flopped between “you’re being crazy” to “I love you please talk to me baby”. And then eventually I was a “crazy bitch”. 

Around 4:30 am, he used my hidden key to enter my apartment, and I was woken up to him crawling into my bed and crying that he didn’t think I’d actually dump him. Crazy, he knew from the beginning, agreed to the boundary, and expected me to just drop it since we had an emotional attachment? Not happening. 

Then, a few hours later he texted me about how it was all made up because he wanted to see my reaction. There is no strip club party, he just wanted to see how I’d react if it ever came up in the future. He wasn’t expecting me to actually break up with him. This wasn’t any better than there actually being a strip party in my opinion. This might actually be worse. He wanted to see how far he could push my boundary, to see if I’d let him cross it. Although I’m not sure I believe him anyways, he said it’s a regular bar party, and I’m invited but why wait hours and after a breakup to admit it? Maybe it’s crazy to assume he spoke to his friend and asked him to cover for him with a “regular party,” and then go to the strip party in secret. But it’s also freaking crazy to make up something just to see if you can get your girlfriend to sacrifice her feelings for your fun. 

Either way, I won’t be getting back with him, ever. This was an eye opening experience. My locks are getting changed by maintenance today, and his number is being blocked. I’m too old be playing these middle school games. 

As for the comments that said I was punishing my bf for the actions of my ex, wrong. I’ve never ever been okay with this. I’ve always considered naked women rubbing their tits and ass on you to be cheating regardless of where it takes place. I don’t care if it’s normalized by tv, movies, etc. It is not something I am willing to ever tolerate in a partner. I don’t care if it’s seen as controlling either. If you think saying “I won’t tolerate being cheated on, I will leave” is controlling, that’s you. And it’s also why I said it before we entered a relationship. It’s why I worded it “hey, I can tell things are getting serious, before we are exclusive I think going to strip clubs and getting lap dances are cheating. If your ideals don’t align, that’s fine, I won’t try to control you, we just don’t need to pursue a relationship. It’s a boundary I won’t ever cross” He said he was fine with it, they’re stupid, he doesn’t want to go.

He also said male strip clubs are different because male strippers will sleep with women customers for free, but you have to pay for female strippers to do that and he isn’t that type of guy.


UPDATE AGAIN

There was a strip club party 🤣 you all called it. He was lying and planning on going anyways, and it was last night. I made friends with one of their other guy friend’s girlfriend. Her boyfriend declined going, but she told me there absolutely was a strip club party, and my ex did plan to attend. Whatever.",1686604386.0,ThrowRA_10567,relationship_advice
Am I throwing away a good partner due to lack of chemistry? 28m 26f,"I (28M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been together for a little over 2 years. She’s objectively beautiful, sweet as can be, and enjoys some of the same interests as me. Seems perfectly great right? Well the issue I’m having in our relationship I believe to be a lack of chemistry and… attraction on my end. She’s beautiful but I don’t find myself lusting after her. As I’ve analyzed our relationship from the last 2 years I’m not sure I ever did. Our sex life is mostly dead (lack of my own interest mostly) and when we do have sex it’s awkward. Most of our conversations are dull and awkward.

To give some more context, we started dating immediately (like less than a week) after going through rough breakup from long term relationships. We were living together within a couple months. I feel so conflicted because she’s like a perfect human, but there feels like there’s something not clicking with me. I feel like I want to be in love with her but after 2 years it feels like I’ve been trying to convince myself that I love her because she checks all the boxes of a good partner. 

This also makes me feel incredibly guilty, like I’m wasting her time when she could’ve found someone better than me that she can be truly in love with and have a great romantic life with. 

Am I being an idiot? Am I going to throw a wonderful person away because I’m confused? Are all the signs right in front of me and I’m just trying to look past them?",1730565652.0,ThrowRA12342069,relationship_advice
My [F33] adult stepson [M26] seems to be becoming a NEET. I love my husband [M46] but am considering leaving.  How do we fix this?,"In 2020 my husband (m46) and I (f33) purchased a larger home and have been married for 5 years.  I wanted to live somewhere quiet in the suburbs and try for children.  Almost immediately upon learning of this, his adult son (m26) requested to move back in.  His son had always lived with his mom so we hadn't spent much time together, but he wanted to move to our city to go to school and take advantage of his free GI Bill college benefits from his father.  We greatly wanted him to find success, and this was an adult family member, so no rent or responsibilities were outlined.

Within a year, though, he had failed the entrance exams and decided not to go back to school.  He spent most of his time visiting his ""family"" (he is very close with his mother's family and there is clear animosity that his dad was away in the military for much of his childhood so he never calls his dad ""family"" - it was the ex-wife who cheated, got pregnant, had the kid under my husband's military insurance, and then divorced and married her affair partner, just in case anyone asks). So shortly after a year of him essentially doing nothing other than playing video games and smoking weed, he moved back to his mom's.

Well about one year later, he requests to move back.  This time it will be different because his mom has helped him to get a WFH position at her company.  So he has a plan and just wants to bond with his dad, save up money, and move out. Okay, sounds good.  At some point we learn that he's deeply in debt.  I had always seen boxes in the mail, he bought a brand new car, and he bragged about his luxury purchases, so I had a hunch but stayed out of it.  The plan became: help him get out of debt and learn about finances.  His dad taught him about interest rates and helped to transfer his balance to a low interest loan.  We chatted about paying it off, but decided to hold off as we hadn't seen any real responsibility.

Unfortunately a few months later, he was let go.  But his spending didn't seem to stop. I continued to get alerts from Ring throughout the middle of the night as he went partying, he continued to have money to spend on weed, played video games all day.  As someone who moved out at 18, worked to get a full ride scholarship, and now works each day to pay for this house -- it definitely felt insulting.  We ended up going to marriage counselling where the therapist was so ridiculous (I think the guy was honestly 100 years old, rambling, drinking ensure to stay alive) that I just let it go for awhile longer.  Before this, I had been cooking meals for everyone, but I basically stopped at this point.

This went on for maybe 6 months, with his dad asking what his plans were, if he'd go to school, join the military, learn a trade, anything.  He didn't want to do anything. He didn't have a passion in life.  So his dad helps him to get a military contracting job.  Secret clearance paid for.  It's a bottom of the ladder job but it's a great stepping stone! He quits on day 2.  He doesn't tell us, he just stops going and I ask after him being home for 1-2 weeks what happened.  His dad confronts him and finds that he didn't like having nothing to do.  Staring at the clock all day.  His dad is disappointed and basically disengages at this point.  He says he isn't helping him anymore (not charging rent, not kicking him out, just not helping him with the career search).

Miraculously, several months later, he lands a well paying job at a medical clinic.  This is great! But after a couple of days his car is still in the drive way.  Why isn't he at work? He stops leaving his room until we've gone to bed, so my husband puts off talking to him.  We find out maybe 2 months later that he quit because he wanted to go to Europe with his family.  Family means everything to this kid.  He couldn't give up the opportunity to go on this family vacation that his MD grandma was paying for, even for a high paying job that didn't require a college degree!

My husband says he needs to find a job or he's out of the house.  It's a weak threat, because at this point he's declined help from everyone.  His uncle basically hands him a marketing position -- he says the can't do it because he wants to go out for his birthday weekend.  His other uncle gets him interviews for Costco, he doesn't go.  My husband had recruiters call him, he hung up once he figured it out.  At this point I'm talking to my husband about wanting to move out, myself.  I work hard at a high stress job and it's honestly too much to have someone I consider to be a NEET living in the home that I pay for.  He doesn't come out until night time, doesn't interact with us, basically acts like he doesn't exist.  I only see Ring alerts all night (my only rule is no smoking weed in the house, so I guess to go smoke).  I feel it isn't healthy for him either.  I've even run this situation by my husband's mother (she's Asian, I'm not, so this is all especially difficult as culturally family should support each other) and she said kick him out.

I feel guilty at the same time, though.  What if he's depressed? What if he's really trying? Would charging rent that we put into an account help? But you need a job to pay rent.  I don't want to ruin my husband's relationship with his son, which is why I'm feeling like I need to be the one to leave.  But my husband believes his son needs a wake up call and that he will ultimately thank him for doing this.  So I'm asking at this point, what should we do?

TLDR: Adult stepson doesn't want to work or go to school, just wants to play video games and smoke weed.  I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the situation and environment in my home and feel like one of us needs to leave.  But would love to have a solution where everyone ends up happy.

Edit - I want to sincerely thank everyone for providing advice and perspective.  You've made me feel I'm not a terrible person for wanting this and that it really is the best course of action.  My husband is fed up with the situation and is ready to provide him with the eviction notice tonight.  I hope someday in the near future he will find his path and hopefully this will be a positive step towards that.  ",1727368153.0,NeedGuidance12345,relationship_advice
"My(43m) GF(36f) asked to open the relationship, and i just pointed her to the door.","So, like the title says, My(43m) GF(36f) asked that we open the relationship, and i just pointed her to the door. it was too much?I strongly believe that in a monogamus relationship when someone ask to open it, well is because that person saw something else out there and is ready to try it instead of working in the relationship. Basically is blindsiding his/her partner.

So i have being with Fran (36) over the last two years and a half, almost two as a couple. I tought that things where moving smothly and was about to ask her to move in (At the begining of April), But lately she was acting rather distant. So i dicided to wait a little and watch. (i was cheated on the past, so i'm a little cautios with some signs)Out of nowhere this last friday she asked me to open the relationship, she gave me all her big speech, and when she ended her ""presentation"" i asked her if she has someone in mind, because is not like we decided to day and basically going out with other persons tomorrow, basically i trick her into tell me what i alredy knew, and yes she has someone in mind, wich means to me, that either she already did it or she has all set up.

So i got up, walk around the apartment while she was trying to sell that this could be good for both us and our relationship, by the time she ended talking i hand her one of my sportbags with all  her stuff in it, and tell her to left the spare key over the table on her way out, that we are done and she knows why.

Then i went to the couch and turn on the TV, just trying to look indiferent and save face, she was speecheless for a while, about to cry, but before she couldn't say something, i tell her that i didn't wanna talk about anything and she should leave.

As soon as she left, i felt like crap, so unworthy, cryied a little and as right now i'm still mourning.

My phone has going almost nuclear with al the calls and text i recibed from friends of both sides about my extreme reaction over her “simple” request. Don't know what she told them.

So now i'm sitting wondering if i really went overboard and at the same time fighting the urge to run back to her, because deep inside even knowing my feelings for her are still there, the trust is gone and i'm not gonna spend all my time watching her movements, is not healthy, may be in time, really don´t know.

Before anyone pointed out, yes i know, my reaction is pure reflection of me, not what she did or was about to do, or could do.

so, did i went overboard?

Update: I think my (23M) best friend's (24M) fiance hates me and I don't know why.,"So...I guess it's safe to say that the wedding is off. On Friday I came here with the problem of my bestfriends fiance hating me. After getting a ton of great advice, I was able to speak to Finn when he dropped by the next day. We spoke for a really long time, with some really weird things being said (check previous update). Anyways, after Saturday, Finn told me he'd call me that night after he spoke to his fiance, Sara. Well that never happened.

Sunday dinner rolled around and everyone came by. I knew he had spoke to Sara because she was giving me a death glare from across the table. Alright, now you're starting to piss me off. We get through dinner and now everyone had just been in conversation. At some point, Finn pulled both me and Sara outside to the backyard. There was a long silence, but then Finn cleared his throat and then the conversation went something like this:

Finn: Do it.

Sara: I already told you, I'm not doing anything.

Me: What does she have to do?

Finn: She needs to apologize about everything so we can all be fine.

Sara: I did nothing wrong. Your relationship is weird. (My name) is weird. His relationship with your family is weird, and I should be the one making you apologize.

Me: I get why you're upset, but things Finn said in the past are not my fault, and I'm sure there are some things people say where they're drunk that they don't-

So at this point, Sara got red in the face and just began screaming. Watching this play out in real time, the first thought in my head was ""She needs a fucking exorcism."" Most of what she was saying couldn't even be understood, but I made out things like ""He fucking knew"" and ""Why would you tell him you said that, I knew you two had something going on."" W. T. F. So at that point Finn's parents and siblings had finally came outside because of Sara and they asked what's going on. I try to explain, but Sara just starts screaming that I'm a ""dirty dog that needs to be put down."" I guess to cool the situation down, after a little convincing Finns mom is able to get Sara into the house. Finns sister also went inside with them, leaving only me, Finn, Finn's older brother, and Finn's dad outside. I explain my side of the story and then Finn explains his side. We spoke about the talk Finn and I had at my apartment on Saturday. He received some teasing for the weird comment he made about me, but the conversation became serious again. Eventually Finn's mom and sister come back outside. They say that Sara is in the bathroom cleaning herself up. His mom starts the conversation with ""Are you two messing around?"" I'm. Fucking. FLOORED. I fill her in on everything she is yet to know. I tell her that I've never flirted, kissed, or doing anything else that was not platonic with Finn.

I'm guessing Sara was listening in through the backdoor instead of just coming out, because as soon as the words left my mouth she came out screaming at me that I'm a liar. I ask her at what point have I ever made her feel like I'm chasing after Finn. I mean I'm helping to fund their damn wedding.  Finn parents are trying to help her understand that everything is being misunderstood, but she isn't having it. She kept yelling until the point where Finn had to pull her aside. It started off as a yelling match between them, but then things finally began to calm down and I thought she understood and we could talk it out. RIGHT???? WRONG!!! Color me fucking surprised when she walks back over like everything is fine and slaps me. After the long period of silence and shock, I was just done and I was like ""I'm out."" Finn and Sara begin yelling at eachother again but at that point of couldn't have cared any less. I head back inside to grab my things cause I'm done with the situation. Eventually Sara's screams at Finn go from calling him names to her saying ""I'm sorry"" and ""give it back"". Finn yelled at her to stop. Hell, even I was scared and I didn't even do anything. He then said something like ""I let you have the wedding how you wanted. I've never given you a reason to doubt me.The fact that you're just yelling and screaming here like a toddler is honestly something I'm not looking for in a partner. You make up this fake scenario in your head, and why?? What good does that do. You're pissed about a comment made at a party before we even dated, and that is crazy to me.  You won't apologize. You won't listen. I should took the ring the moment you slapped him. Nobody in this house has EVER disrespected everyone else like you've done today."" Finn came inside as well, and began grabbing his things. He told his parents that he's gonna sleep in his old bedroom upstairs for a few nights which they were fine with. I knew Sara had driven over with him, and before anything, no matter what they went through he should make sure he gets her home safe. After I spoke to him about taking her home he agreed. Everyone had finished grabbing their things around the same time with me, Finn, Sara, and his siblings all heading to our cars at the same time. The entire time, I was surprised but not interested when Sara began apologizing to me. I mean, I didn't even want her to apologize in the first place, but just treat me with the kindness I offered to her. Why did we have to go through all of this for you to realize that you're just being downright nasty. I'm not sure if she's been cheated on in the past or if it's some kind of trauma or something, but it's also not for me to figure out. Finn ended up dropping her off, and I'm guessing he called me by the time he got back to his parents place. I didn't even answer because I was just tired and the entire confrontation drained me. It definitely could have went better, and I hoped that this would be something that could be easily fixed, instead it destroyed a relationship which I feel shitty about. It's Monday after noon and there is still no word on if Finn and Sara have even spoke to eachother this morning. I haven't spoken to anyone this morning either, but Finn did send me a few tiktok videos. I think it's just sad because even with the way she treated me, I think their relationship was a beautiful thing, and it socks that things such as jealousy and misunderstandings can be silent killers to a relationship. I thank you all for the advice and for pushing me towards talking to someone about this. I wish things could have ended differently, but as some of you said, this should be a wake up call towards both Finn and I. I'm not sure what will come of everything. Maybe they will reconcile eventually, but I think for now the wedding may be off.

TLDR: I think my (23M) best friend's (24M) fiance hates me and I don't know why.

My (31F) fiancé (26M) choked me so hard during sex that I lost consciousness. Is this something to worry about?,"My fiancé and I live 2 hours away from each other and we only get to see each other at most about 4 days a month. We usually try to have as much sex as possible whenever I’m at his place because and usually it’s pretty great. Occasionally he likes to spice things up and do CNC and he usually lets me know ahead of time that wants to do that kind of roleplaying. It’s not my favorite thing in the world but I let him do it occasionally when he expresses that desire to me beforehand.

We were on probably round 3 of sex and things were good/I was enjoying myself. He tells me about halfway thru to lay on my back (and I obliged because I really enjoy missionary for the romantic “looking into each other’s eyes” aspect). He starts off normally in missionary and all is well until he starts getting a bit rough (rougher than usual). 

Then without warning he wraps his hands around my throat and starts squeezing as hard as he can. He’d choked me during sex in the past, but never this rough. I was seriously having trouble breathing and scratching/pulling at his hands trying to get them off my throat. 

My vision was going static and then things went silent, everything went black, and before I knew what was happening I’m waking up to him frantically saying my name and shaking me and trying to wake me up. I didn’t know what was going on or what had happened but I was terrified and had the overwhelming urge to sob so that’s what I did. 

He pulled me into a hug, asked if I was alright and told me to look him in the eyes and promise I was alright. It took maybe a solid 30-40 seconds to get my eyes uncrossed. From the moment I came to my eyes were stuck crossed and that scared both him and me. But finally after rubbing my eyes really hard I got them to uncross. I was apologizing profusely for losing consciousness while sobbing and he was just holding me and telling me it’s ok because he’s got me. 

He told me that I should get some rest (it was getting close to 12am and I usually fall asleep around 10:45pm). So he held me while I drifted off to sleep. Of course I didn’t really get to sleep for very long because I felt like I’d only just fallen into a deep sleep when I felt him climb on top of me and start pulling my panties to the side and start thrusting again. I guess he was still turned on from a little bit ago, and when I started to open my eyes he put a pillow over my face and went at it till he was finished. At this point, I just don’t really know how to feel. Since then I’ve not felt very sexy and haven’t sent him very many nudes. It doesn’t help that for a couple days now he’s been more snappy and reserved (maybe it’s because he’s started to get a cold or something). All I know is that things have been awkward between us since I got back from his house and he’s gone right back to being distant and acting like I’m an afterthought. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: is it normal for someone to go into CNC without letting their partner know beforehand? And is it normal to lose consciousness from being choked extra hard?

TL;DR - My (31F) fiancé (26M) choked me so hard during sex that I lost consciousness. Is this something to worry about? 

Edit: for some reason I’m heaving issues upvoting/replying to comments and it’s really frustrating because there are comments I want to reply and questions I’m trying to answer. 

Edit 2: ok I’ve started being able to upvote and reply to some comments. I’d like to clarify that this isn’t fake, I’ve just been conditioned to violence and abuse. Also, my daughter and fiancé have never met. 

Here are some symptoms I’ve had since I last saw my fiancé: recurring headaches, diarrhea, panic attacks and emotion breakdowns (both of which happened in front of my boss during a job performance meeting), my acid reflux has gotten worse, I’ve been having trouble swallowing my food/drinks, and my mom has commented that my voice sounds a little hoarse. 

Edit 3: I’ve been having some neck pain so I decided to take some pics with my front facing phone camera. Now I know why my neck hurts - apparently I do in fact have bruises on my neck. ",1726762611.0,CatsAndCoffeeMyDude,relationship_advice
Boyfriend won’t stop telling me I have B.O.,"I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and everything has been great except for one thing. 
Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o. 

When we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store. 

I am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?

Update  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. 
I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up. 

He got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.

Needless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today.",1591511084.0,ThrowRA-doistink,relationship_advice
My (25m) Girlfriend (24f) accidentally admitted she thinks I'm small,"As the title says, last night I was searching something on my girlfriend's phone because my data wasn't working, and I saw an article open ""Blowjob tips for small penises"".

I laughed immediately and showed her what I found, and my plan was to just laugh it off since after all, the entire reason she had the tab open is to make sex better for us.

But then as I continued cooking our dinner I felt cold, almost like when you've had a drink and the world is stepping away from you.

She was completely mortified that I'd seen it and I know that she didn't mean for me to, and the entire reason it was there was a good one.

Eventually I asked the question ""Do you think I'm small then?""

With little to no hesitation she replied ""You said it yourself, you're on the smaller side.""

That felt shit to hear. I asked what her process was - did she Google ""Blowjobs for small dicks"" straight away, or did she Google ""Blowjob tips"", try them out, realise I don't have the length for them and THEN Google the other thing.

Turns out she skipped straight to ""For small dicks""

I then asked the dumbest question a man can ask - ""I take it that means I'm the smallest you've ever been with then?""

Her response was ""Yes, but the best""

That should put my mind at ease...but it just didn't. It really didn't.

I cooked for a while without really talking, then we ate and talked over dinner.

I explained what I was feeling and why I felt that way, and she listened and apologised and said she wishes she could take it back.

The kicker is...I'm 5.5"" with decent girth. I'm not small, I'm pretty bang on average. I just so happen to be over 6' tall and have a rugby player's build, I'm a grower as well so when everything is in proportion, it looks tiny compared to the rest of my body. So naturally, I've always been insecure about it.

What else is funny is that she's 5' tall, and yet she thinks my dick is small. I've always felt like it was but to have it outright confirmed as a matter of fact by your girlfriend...I feel cold, almost.

I was able to shake most of this off last night and we had a pretty good evening. Watched a film, hung out, laughed, and even had sex. But during the last bit I looked down, and rather than thinking ""she looks so good right now"", I was thinking ""she's right, it IS small"".

I know this is my insecurity to deal with, but I'm finding it difficult, hence why I'm making this post.

We got up this morning, she was out of bed before I was, and when I got up to make breakfast I couldn't bring myself to make eye contact with her, or hold proper conversation with her.

I even found myself flinching when she wanted a kiss, almost as if I didn't want to.

We talked this morning and I explained that although I thought I was over it last night, the way I feel this morning shows I'm clearly not.

I know there's no magic solution and I know everyone on here will say something along the lines of ""Get over your insecurities"" or ""leave her"", but I just feel so trapped with the thoughts in my head, and I don't know how to move forward from this.

So I'm making this post as a hail Mary, I suppose, and hoping someone out there can give me some advice on how to deal with what I'm feeling.

UPDATE:

I never thought I'd update this, but first off, thank you to everyone for the kind words and encouragement. 

We talked a fair bit and did our best to enjoy the rest of the weekend. It wasn't as good as we'd hoped, but it definitely had a few good memories made.

While I'm glad to say that I'm pretty much over my insecurities about my size, thanks to a lot of the comments and input here, therapy, and hitting the gym consistently, I'm also afraid to say that my girlfriend and I split up early February.

However, it was *completely unrelated to this incident*. It was an amicable breakup, simply due to us being in different places in life and not being the right person for each other, so although it's a shame this didn't work out as we'd hoped, we walked away on good terms.

I'm happy to report that I'm in the best place of my life, and although I'd love to find a new partner, I'm not going to spend every waking moment looking for her.

Thanks again to everyone for your kind words, I hope that anyone else who shares some of the feelings I expressed finds this comments section as helpful as I did.

Peace and love to you all <3",1701786924.0,ukredditthrowaway180,relationship_advice
My (24F) boyfriend (26M) almost got me fired from my job,"I won’t disclose my job position as I  am attempting to stay anonymous, but I work with client files that can contain sensitive information, and since COVID I have been working from home, with a company computer.

I got a call a few weeks ago and it was my supervisor as well as HR, and our department manager. They called me into the corporate building (of our area) to come in and talk, so I knew it was serious. They kept asking me if I knew a Lindsay Parks (for the sake of the story I’ll call this person Lindsay Parks). I was confused and said no, and they told me that I had opened her file unauthorized. (I’m not allowed to deal with files for people that I know, or open files that I’m not assigned to). 

I was confused and denied it because I really didn’t know this person, so they opened the file to see if there was an associated party on the file that I know. And lo and behold my boyfriend’s name was listed as an associate party. I had to tell them this was my boyfriend, and they said they were going to going to place me on suspension until they investigate.

I got home and when my boyfriend got home I told him what had happened. He got a bit red in the face, and then admitted that he used Lindsay’s number to look up her file and see if there were any updates as he knew I worked for the company and that she hadn’t heard from them and wanted to check out her file. 

I told him this wasn’t okay and I’m probably going to get fired for his carelessness, and who Lindsay was and why was he was listed as an associate party on her file. He said a friend, and then went back to saying how it wasn’t his fault and that he didn’t know I’d get in trouble, and that I shouldn’t have made my work password something he’d know.

They finished their investigation, and after my boyfriend confessed, I had surprisingly gotten my job back. I have since been working in an empty office at the corporate building because they don’t want anything similar happening again.

Communication with my boyfriend has been very limited except for if it pertains to our daughter. I feel like he tried gaslighting me and this situation just is making me feel extremely uneasy 

TLDR: my partner wen to. My work computer, opened a file for a “friend”, and almost got me fired by doing so. Now I’m working in the corporate building to prevent this from happening again, and our relationship is strained after it feels like he gaslighted me into thinking this was my fault",1601140668.0,THROWRAalmostfired1,relationship_advice
My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.",1561131221.0,whydoideservethis,relationship_advice
How do I (37M) respond to my pregnant wife (34F) striking me?,"Throwaway because my wife knows about my Reddit.

I (37M) have been with my wife (34F) for 9 years. We've been married for 4. She's currently 8 months pregnant with our daughter, staying at home. I work full time, with overtime, and take care of her when I'm home, but her mother lives in our guest house and has been helping out with everything else.

I came home yesterday from work to find my wife directly in front of the door looking insanely pissed off. I asked her what was wrong, and she just grabbed me by the arm and dug her nails in (she has those long, pointy fake nails). I already have scratches from the way she's grabbing me at this point. She drags me to the bathroom and points at our cat's litterbox, which is one of those expensive litter robots. It's full and not working apparently.

She starts screaming at me about how it's my job to clean it because she's pregnant and the cat took a shit under our bed. I immediately apologized, I know it's dangerous for pregnant women to clean that stuff. I tried to calm her down by saying that I was sorry and would clean it, that I was just stressed with overtime and had forgotten. She punched me in the chest, slapped my face, and kept screaming at me that I was useless. I just stood there and didn't say anything, I was just shocked that she had hit me. After a while, she stormed into our room and locked the door. I didn't know how to respond at that point, so I deep cleaned the litter robot and slept on the couch.

I woke up today and she's acting like nothing happened. She texted me good morning while I was at work like usual. I don't know how itll be when I'm home. She never has done something like this, the worst things prior were throwing things at walls during arguments very occasionally. I don't know what to do.

Update: I called her OB basically immediately once I realized she was likely in a psychotic episode, and she agreed with me that it could be a possibility but was also very concerned for my wellbeing. She helped me lay out a safety plan and encouraged me to call the police or speak with her about going to the emergency room if I felt safe and she became a threat to herself or others again. 

When I got home, my wife was completely normal and happy. I asked if we could talk about last night and she was confused. Genuinely zero recollection of the night. I tried to explain but ended up showing her the Reddit post and letting her read the comments. She had a really bad mental breakdown (no hitting or abusive comments, just a lot of screaming and crying) and we ended up going to the hospital. She was institutionalized and is currently being evaluated. I don't know much, but I figured I'd update here because I don't really have anyone else to speak with about this. 

I know she is incredibly, incredibly apologetic. She has a history of childhood abuse and partner abuse, and hearing that she acted like that hurt her deeply. She promised she would never do something like that again and was horrified when I showed her that she had left cuts and a bruise. It's all documented for myself and my future daughter's safety, but I don't intend on telling her that because I think that would only make the present situation worse. 

Everything's kinda clicked for me now. For the past few weeks I have noticed her constantly forgetting things, acting confused, and becoming frustrated over simple tasks. She was paranoid and talking about how her mom wanted to steal the baby. She's randomly become super into spirituality and has been rambling about the due date's astrological implications. While it was a bit odd, I just thought she was being cute and quirky in the moment. I blamed too much shit on normal pregnancy hormones and emotions. Now I realize she was probably serious and struggling with mental illness. I have no reason to believe she is genuinely an abuser and I'm scared as shit for what's to come. I feel partially responsible because I impregnated her and caused all of this to happen, which is an extra layer of horrible. Anyways. That's it for now. This could all be me rationalizing abuse, like the people in the comments believe. I'm looking for a therapist.",1698791167.0,Melodic-Minute6352,relationship_advice
I [26M] confessed my greatest fear to my girlfriend [24F] and she didn’t like my answer.,"Recently, my [26M] and my girlfriend [24F] have been working on some pre-martial/pre-engagement exercises to prepare us for our seemingly inevitable engagement and marriage. So, one of the questions that popped up for us in a book was “What is your greatest fear” and she was supposed to guess what my greatest fear was. She guessed “losing me (I.e. her dying)” and then laughed and said “what is your biggest fear? We’ve never talked about this”. So I replied with “I think my biggest fear is being perceived as a bad man” and the later “I want to be a good man”. She didn’t like this answer since she said that she and my family should be the most important part of my life and their safety should be my biggest fear. Granted, I fear for her safety. I’ve done things like pushed her to get pepper spray and we’ve looked into getting CCLs. I also ask her when she gets places.

She accused me of being egotistic and prideful. When I explained that the fear doesn’t come from a place of egotism but rather my character she didn’t really care. She said “why would I want to be with a man whose biggest fear is not the safety of his family and loved ones”. 

The result was a rather large fight between us about how I am her biggest priority because her biggest fear is my death whereas she is not my biggest priority because that’s not my biggest fear. Now she’s threatening to kick me out and break up. 

How do I reconcile this? Where do I go from here?

TLDR;
I [26M] confessed my greatest fear is being perceived as a bad man to my girlfriend [24F] and she accused me of being egotistic. She wants my greatest fear to be losing my family to untimely death. How do I reconcile our relationship and her new perception of me?

Edit:
Well, thanks guys for all the advice. It’s been very helpful processing this whole thing. At first I thought I was wrong but I see clearly now that it’s a mix of both of us. Something we can both work on. 

I had a conversation with her about the situation again and tried my best to share my heart behind the fear. I stated that the fear came from a place of wanting to measure up to what I thought a good father, husband, friend, and leader would be. My fear is that I wouldn’t measure up to that and be seen as a bad man. I’d say the reaction was mixed. While she did admit that it shed a different light on the issue, she never really admitted that she was wrong in judging my fears. Her response seemed fairly adversarial as she stated that “anyone would be hurt by being told their family or partner’s greatest fear isn’t their loss (again, untimely death)”. I did my best to ask for forgiveness in areas where I damaged our relationship in the heat of the moment but when I pressed her for an apology I got the classic “I’m sorry but you…” answer. Guess it’s better than nothing🤷🏼‍♂️. 

It does seem like the relationship is in a repairable state. I do love her dearly and I’d hate to throw such a wonderful thing away for being candid and honest. Seems like a true waste!",1699968424.0,ThrowRA_Dry_Iron7989,relationship_advice
My (32m) partner (33f) went to sleep crying on her birthday and I don't know how to make up to her,"Hi friends,

So, a little background to the title is a must...
My partner had her birthday the other day. I baked her a cake, we had a romantic evening with wine and cheese, and her friends came over and surprised her.

All in all, she was happy and just kept telling me what a fun day she had.

When we went to bed, trouble came...

She asked me for some ""tinglies"". Basically she likes it when I run my fingers through her hair, or whisper in her ear or just draw on her back. 
I told her I was too tired, as we stayed up later than usual with her friends and I was not up for it.

This turned into a small argument where she said that it's the only thing she wanted. And that I haven't been doing it for her lately, and that ahe thought that at least on her birthday I could do it for her etc etc...

Then, it turned to tears.
Please note that after offering to do it for her anyways she said no because she was too upset.

Now, she has barely spoken to me the last few days. She said she feels like I need to make it up to her somehow and the fact that I haven't done so yet and just said I was sorry wasn't good enough.

Here's where tou guys/gals can help...

Is there anything that I can do to remedy this? We have been together for 5 years and this is tge first time I'm feeling lost as to how I can make up to her.

Sidenote, we live in Israel, where there's currently a war going on so going out to eat is out of the question.

Please help?
Thank, friends.

EDIT: Guys, I know it's difficult to keep your opinions to yourselves, but I really don't think this post is the place to begin the whole ""Israel is wrong"" or ""Jews deserve to die"" or even ""Destroy Palestine"". Not the place.
If you feel strongly about it, I am happy to discuss anything in private.

This place should be supportive and wholesome regardless of my place of birth/residence. Otherwise it seems a little antisemitic. Don't be those guys please :)",1698403533.0,Negative_Opening_648,relationship_advice
My husband eats so. much. food. (over 10k calories a day) and has gotten SO obese and I just don't fucking know what to do anymore.,"He didn't use to be like this. We got married when we were both 25, now we're 33 and he's gone from around 180 to over 450 pounds.

Looking at him fills me with horror and despair. He may as well have been diagnosed with terminal cancer because his size is going to have the same result sometime in the next 10 years if he doesn't stop. In my heart I no longer believe my husband will be here by the time I'm 50.

His medical problems so far:

- A mini stroke from a blood clot

- Abnormal heart palpitations

- ER visits both of those times

- Extremely high blood pressure

- Extremely high cholesterol

- Diabetes (didn't check his levels or take insulin as directed until I began reminding him)

- Inability to walk much (uses a scooter sometimes)

- Joint pain

- Lymphedema in one of his legs

- Sleep apnea and has to wear a cpap machine at night so he won't literally die from not breathing

- Five different medications that I manage the scheduling of or he wouldn't remember/not care/I don't know.

His diet:

- Fast food. Goes through drive thru's on his way to work, way home, and/or picks up takeout. Mcdonald's, Burger King, local Chinese joints, taco bell, KFC, popeyes, Domino's, Dunkin donuts, Chick Fil A, pizza hut, Arbys......... 

- Also gets all this delivered from uber eats whenever he feels like it, which is at least once a day. He even does it in the middle of the night.

- Everything else is just junk food like chips and other packaged snacks. All sorts of candy. Ice cream. Baked desserts. Frozen/microwave food like breakfast trays and sausages, burrito's, easy mac, basically anything you could find at a gas station convenience store. 

- All his meals are full of sugar, frying oil, butter, fat and grease, just the worst ingredients that are exactly what he needs to stop eating.

We're both WFH right now. I've watched him for a few days this week keeping a record of everything he ate (that I saw--if he ate at night or when I was in another room, I missed those) and then looked up the approximate caloric value of every item. Every single day was AT LEAST 10,000 calories. The worst day was a little over 14,000. A sedentary male of his age and height needs around 2500/day, just for comparison.
 
So this has been an ongoing problem for years and just keeps getting worse. Both his diet and the medical consequences.

I. Am. Terrified... that I'm going to be burying him, possibly before we even reach our 50's and get to enjoy old age together. I'm terrified I'm going to have to see the person I love most in the entire world die from a long, drawn out, painful accumulation of treatable illnesses. And some days I wonder if I'm not already watching that, in slow motion.

I have asked him so many times to please, please eat healthier. He will...he eats the healthy meals I make, but then he STILL eats junk food after. Or orders a second fast food dinner. He doesn't get it's not enough to combat the damage to his body.

I've also begged him to go to the doctor. He only goes when something is catastrophically wrong (see the emergencies in my list above). In fact most of the more ""minor"" problems in that list were only diagnosed because he happened to be at the ER for something major and they found it. 

I've begged him to see a doctor for a routine, non-emergency, check up specifically with the aim of building a support plan for weight loss and healthier diet. He says he'll do it then has excuses why he didn't. I myself have gone ahead and made a couple appointments for him to make sure calling people wasn't stressing him out, and then when the time came he just never went. Same thing with a therapy appointment. I set it up for him and he never went. I wondered and still do if there's something like depression at play, and this is the form it takes? But I'll never know if he won't talk about it to anyone. He doesn't even talk to ME about what's causing it. Beyond saying he just likes food and eating makes him happy.

I'm reaching a point where I feel like my heart is breaking. Like he's leaving me, even though our relationship is as strong as ever. I don't understand it. Why doesn't he care.

What else can I do to get him to take care of himself? Does he not understand that every day he doesn't change is one day closer to him dying young?

I live with this fear every single day and I just can't do it anymore, I need to find SOMETHING that will make him stop. I'm desperate. I cannot just fucking give up. Please give me any suggestions you can think of, I'll try anything.

TL;DR: My husband has been overeating for years, gained hundreds of pounds, nothing I say or try to do for him has made a difference. He's going to die. I know it. I need to convince him to just take that single first step towards getting better.",1590800709.0,ThrowRAhusbandhealth,relationship_advice
[Update] My Fiance's ex sent me their sex tapes and I made the terrible mistake of watching it,"Here is a link to the original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/?ref=share&ref_source=link

As for the update, after posting here and reading the advice and reflecting on my actions, I realized what I did was wrong and a violation of my fiance's privacy. I allowed my insecurities to dictate my actions. Even though my fiance is okay with me using his phone, my intent to snoop made what i did wrong.  So I decided to just come clean.

I sat him down the next day and told him that the ex sent me the videos as well, and also came clean about the snooping. He was pretty upset, but surprisingly he wasn't that upset with the snooping, he seemed more upset that his ex had somehow managed to cause drama once again in his life. He told me that he hadn't watched any of the videos because in a majority of them he was uncomfortable with recording them and only did it for her and was afraid if watching it made me look at him in a bad way. This made me feel even shittier for what i did and I apologized again and reassured him that they did not in anyway lessen my feelings or respect for him. I wanted him to have some time to process things and decide what to do about the ex and what I did, so I gave him some space.

That night, I decided to cook his favorite meal as a sort of apology dinner and discuss things. He seemed in a much better mood. He apologized to me for not telling me about the tapes right away and for being an idiot and not realizing that she would come after me when he had blocked her. He told me he appreciated me coming clean about the snooping and understood how I got carried away and that I could have just talked to him and he would have given me his phone and reassured me that he hadn't kept any of the videos.

I asked if he was going to press charges regarding revenge porn and he told me that he wanted nothing to do with her and that we should just move on and enjoy our engagement and forget the whole thing. I told him it was completely his choice and I support him and would delete the videos and block her right away.

Finally, I brought up the texts and he apologized to me for the rant. He told me that was the first time in a long time that he had actually thought about who was better and that he had never actively compared me with any of his exes before. He told me he should have just answered it with a simple ""my fiancee is better"", and tried to apologize again. I told him that he didn't have to sugarcoat anything and that it was his private conversation with a friend and I have no right to be mad when he wasn't really disrespectful about me or our sex life. I also told him that it was okay if she was better and I didn't have to be the best at everything.

He explained to me that after talking to Sarah he thought more about it and that he hadn't really expressed his thoughts well in the text but he would like to explain it better:

> You are the best I have had, I am not lying or sugarcoating anything. If someone asked me who is the most skilled or the most adventurous sexual partner that I have had, then yeah it would probably be her. 

>But that doesn't really matter because if someone asked me what was the best sex I have ever had, my first thought would be the time when we had sex right after you asked me to marry you, and then it would be the night when you first told me you loved me and third would be the time when we had sex in the kitchen the day I moved in. For all her skill and experience, she couldn't even make the top 3, and we have the rest of our lives to make sure that she doesn't even come near the top 100. So no, I am not lying when I say you are the best I have had.

I am not going to lie, despite what I said about not needing to be the best, just hearing what he said (maybe i butchered the quote, he was so much more charming and eloquent) made me really happy, so I kissed him and asked him if he wanted to try and break into the top 3 again. Then, we had sex :) . I didn't really specifically try to be more aggressive but I tried to focus more on what he was feeling to reassure myself that he was enjoying it as much as I did. That naturally allowed me to be the one in the lead and it was great. I could tell that he really enjoyed it as well.

I know I have to work on my insecurities and potentially see a therapist, but for now I will try my best to just forget what I saw on those videos and enjoy being engaged to the most amazing man I know.

TL;DR: I fessed up, my fiance was very graceful and even tried to take some of the blame. We made up and will continue to enjoy the post engagement bliss.

PS: I appreciate the harsh comments that told me I was wrong to snoop. But those of you that sent me hateful pms telling me that I was no better than his ex and that I should leave him? Seriously, fuck off. I maybe an insecure nut sometimes, but I have never ever taken it out on him and would never hurt him like she did. And me wanting to be the best sex he has had is not some narcissistic ego trip. It was because to me he is the best sex I have ever had (and hopefully ever will) and I wanted to be the same for him. I don't think there is anything wrong with that.",1597352892.0,ThrowRAsadfiance2020,relationship_advice
My boyfriend (24M) planned a road trip with me (24F) and his three friends. I have been uninvited.,"For starters, my boyfriend and I have been dating for four years. Our anniversary was in April and for it we had planned to do a road trip. Obviously that couldn't happen.

Last month he had brought up the idea of a road trip with me, his friends (22F & 24M) & his friend's girlfriend (24F). This would be happening next year. I thought this was a good idea as I am friends with his male friend and his gf but not necessarily his female friend. To tell you the truth, I've always been quite wary of their relationship (previous bf cheated on me and I've still got some insecurities I need to sort out).

I hadn't heard more about it since the trip was brought up in the first place so I asked my bf if it would still be going ahead. He said they had decided it would be a no-girlfriends-allowed trip. Eh, I was fine with that. Me and him could always go ourselves another time and I know friends need time to hang out without their partners.

Nothing more was said about it until today when I happened to glance at his screen and saw that they had made a group chat and were talking about it. I also saw his friend's gf was messaging in it. I asked him why she was in it if she's not going. He got defensive and instantly turned his screen away from me. I asked him why he did that and he said it's a private conversation - I then asked if I could look through the messages.

I found out that she is still invited and it's just me who's been uninvited. I would understand it if she was one of his friends, but she's actually not. In fact, I haven't heard him say one nice word about her. I guess my boyfriend just doesn't want ME there, but is fine with someone he dislikes. I feel so left out as I was made to believe I was part of this friendship group but none of them have even asked me why I'm not going. I don't know if I've misconstrued the situation and have made a big deal out of nothing but I'm just incredibly hurt by this as it's not exactly fair she gets to go when I can't. I'm planning on talking to him about it tomorrow but I just want to get advice.",1590968568.0,ThrowRA-doughnut0,relationship_advice
My boyfriend says I sound like a porn star and it makes me feel really self conscious but he won’t stop saying it,I recently lost my virginity to my boyfriend whereas hes not and has a lot more experience than me. He said I sound like a porn star during sex and he laughs about it and stuff because other girls don’t make sounds. I’m not trying to be extra or anything. It made me feel really embarrassed so I stopped but he asked me why and I told him he keeps making fun of me and he said he was just joking. He still says it now and sometimes mimics me to be funny like if I breathe then he does it too and laughs. I don’t wanna be a porn star or remind him of that I don’t like him saying I remind him of a porn star. Am I just overreacting?? I told my friend and he said he’s just playing around and it’s not a bad thing.,1584146044.0,throwRAaaak,relationship_advice
How do I (F26) tell my partner (M28) to finally go to the dentist and remove his braces and get a clean?,"I’ve been with my partner for a few years, he’s had braces since I met him. I assumed they would be due to remove at any moment now… only to find out he just simply stopped going to the dentist. He’s a grown adult male and it’s killing my attraction to him, sometimes it hurts when we kiss or it grazes on my lips. I just want him to remove them, typically there’s nothing wrong with braces but it’s that he’s being lazy and neglectful. His teeth aren’t brilliant (staining and I think some plaque build up) but his hygiene is very good (he’s always clean, always good breath). So I feel a bit like a superficial asshole when I say I’d like my adult male partner to have his braces removed and teeth cleaned before he meets my parents as we intend to marry. 

How do I even breach this topic? I’ve briefly mentioned before, asking if he has long left, or that he should just remove them if he doesn’t need them anymore… 



UPDATE: So after reading a lot of the comments and doing some research, I started getting more concerned from a health perspective (before it was on principle feeling like he’s not prioritising it as well as cosmetic) so I brought it up. I said I wanted to genuinely talk about his health and how I feel like he’s neglectful and would really appreciate if he would take care of himself better especially regarding his braces and how it can cause cavities or loss of teeth, he said he’s missed so many appointments it’s no longer free (I believe it was through the NHS) and is planning on a private treatment when he gets a better paying job (so he can then save for it). I’m still not entirely content with this as more damage can occur and this is a very loose and vague timeline. However, he did admit that I was right. I know some of you also don’t believe me when I say my boyfriend is clean, but genuinely he is the cleanest person I’ve ever met. He’s just neglecting going to the dentist. My partner is always working hard to do things for the people around him at the detriment of his own health and progression. Some of the comments are way too harsh… but thank you all for giving me the courage to actually just address it and not sugar coat it.",1717372388.0,Madame-Eggshell,relationship_advice
I (27F) told my partner (30M) I was disappointed in his gift. He called me ungrateful. How should I changed the situation? ,"I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, so I'm not used to giving or receiving gifts. I only started gift-giving last year and met my boyfriend after my birthday.

This year, for my birthday, I waited a week for his package to be delivered (we are long-distance). I was so excited to see what he sent, but I felt disappointed after opening it because he sent me 100 pieces of his favorite chocolate—something I could easily buy at the corner store myself. I called my boyfriend and honestly told him that I was disappointed with his gift. I had hoped for something more thoughtful and meaningful, something personalized to me. It didn’t need to have any monetary value, but I wanted it to be specific to the person you’re gifting it to.

He said I cannot easily get this size of the candy (100 pieces) at the corner store and he put thought into buying it for me. 

I would have been happy with something like a card with his heartfelt written words instead of a purchased gift. Because the gift box was heavy, I had assumed it might be something like a makeup stand since he knows I’m into beauty. A gift like that would have been personalized to me as a person he knows and would have been the most meaningful to me.

Instead, his gift of sending me his favorite chocolate felt more like a gift for himself than for me, and he called me ungrateful. Maybe I am ungrateful since, from his perspective, he’s trying to build himself up with a commission job and doesn’t have a steady income yet. He sent me his favorite candy based on the fact that I love chocolate, but if that was the case, I would have preferred if he had sent me my favorite candy instead.

Should I not have been honest about how I felt? I tried the candy today, and it was really good, but how I prefer to receive gifts remains the same.



**EDIT**

I would like to say that my partner is half Brazilian, and he gifted me chocolate candy for Christmas after visiting his family in Brazil. He packed it up in his suit case and brought it to me. I was very happy with this gift because the chocolate candy is not something I can easily get myself, and it was thoughtful of him to want me to try something from his culture. 

And I gifted him a box of Ferrero Rocher for Christmas with a bracelet. 

So I have no issue with with giving or receiving candy as gifts.

[UPDATE] I [24m] gained 70 pounds and ruined my relationship. Is it okay to ask my girlfriend [23f] to stop making mean comments about it?,"Original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/egvgs0/i_23m_gained_70_pounds_and_ruined_my_relationship

Sorry this is kind of long, but it did get quite eventful. 

Thank you so much to everyone who commented. It helped me see my relationship in a different light, so thank you all, even the ones who said I deserved it.

The general consensus was that she was abusive which honestly shocked me at first, I really expected every comment to support how she treated me and say she was just trying to help etc. 

I thought I deserved to be abused for gaining weight, I still kind of believe that, but I think most people treat their partners with kindness. I never want anyone to feel the way i did due to their partner. Also, the high stress/anxiety levels I felt constantly are pretty terrible for losing weight.

I had convinced myself that i was disgusting and undeserving of love and she was just trying to help, but I now realise she probably wasn't even trying to help me at all. It's hard to think that of her, because I love her a lot still despite her faults.

I realised there were a lot of things in our relationship that I was  uncomfortable with that I felt like I could never bring up because she would get upset and start crying so I would end up comforting her, or she would just turn it on me and get angry and blame me. Things always had to go her way or she would start crying.

My girlfriend was entirely dependent on me for money and I paid for literally 95% of things. She never wanted to get a job because I paid for her. I was okay with this because i loved her and felt like i had to prove myself to be worthy of her. I paid all the rent and bills.

2 days ago (NYE) I was in our bedroom on my phone when I got a text. 
It was from an unknown number calling me a ""fat fuck"" and something about how I didn't deserve my girlfriend.
This wasn't too unusual, I have been receiving abusive texts from several different random numbers for months. Mostly about my weight but also about all sorts of things. 

I had several ideas of who it could be, and it was honestly eating me up inside. It was giving me extreme anxiety because they seemed to know so much about me. 

A few hours later, on a whim I decided to call the number. I have done this before but it never got answered. I even spoofed my phone number and still nothing. 

You can probably see where this is going. Vibration came from my girlfriends bag in the cupboard. I guess she forgot to put it on silent. It was like the biggest sinking feeling I have ever felt. She had purchased a burner phone specifically for texting me abuse. She took time out of her day just to put me down anonymously and wear me down further. She wanted me to be hurt and not trust anyone around me. 

I truly never thought she was responsible for them. The thought had come into my head a couple times, but I immediately pushed it out. I didn't believe she was capable of something like that. She was always sympathetic when I got the texts and was ""trying to help me found out who sent them"".

It hurt so badly. I could almost forgive everything else but everyone has a breaking point.. I just feel completely worthless. How disgusting must i be if my own girlfriend wants to say these things to me.. why would she do this? I don't understand. I guess she wanted me to be under her control and even more dependent on her emotionally. I'm trying to get out of the mindset that I deserve this.

I knew I had to end it and I had to do it before she would make me change my mind. I gathered all her stuff up and put it into bags. I was getting extremely upset while doing it and almost stopped, but I was also angry. I don't really get angry, and I previously just accepted her treatment, but something in me just snapped. I was actually mad at her for once.

She was at her friend's house preparing to go out for NYE. I did feel guilty for ruining her night, but she had already ruined mine. I wanted to try and leave her in 2019 and start the new year without her. 

I had to do it right then before I thought about it too much and forgave her like I did for everything else she has done. 
I called a locksmith to come and change the locks. 

I knew she would have an extreme reaction to being broken up with (by her obese boyfriend who doesn't deserve her) no matter the circumstances anyway, so I just had to do it.

I texted her, ""I found your other phone. I love you (her name) but I can't put up with this shit any more. All your stuff is in bags in the hall. Please come by and collect it tomorrow. I changed the locks so you will have to let me know when you're coming beforehand. Happy new year.""

Yes...saying happy new year was a bit petty.

To say she didn't respond well to this would be an understatement. She called me crying, telling me she was sorry and would stop. She told me she was just trying to help me and that she was doing it out of love, she told me she loved me more than anything and she was so sorry... I almost believed her, but I didn't give in. I apologised to her and hung up.

She called me back 2 minutes later angry and screaming how could i dare do this to her, called me a fat disgusting piece of shit and said she never loved me. She screamed that she never wanted me and that no one ever will. She screamed that even my own family didn't care about me (this hurt because my mum was an abusive drug addict and my dad left when i was 10 and i haven't seen him since). She said that whenever we had sex she was thinking about her ex and praying for it to be over. I guess she was just trying to say anything that would hurt me.

I blocked her number. She called me back again on her friends phone screaming how dare could I block her and how dare i could leave her with no place to stay on NYE. I didn't do that, I would never leave her without a place to sleep. She could go to her parents and she has plenty money (that i gave her) so she could get a taxi and stay in a hotel if she preferred. She also said beforehand that she was staying at her friend's that night anyway. 

She posted on her Instagram story that she was ""heartbroken"" and that her ""boyfriend had left her homeless on NYE due to a little misunderstanding. After everything he put me through, he still does this. I loved him and thought he loved me, but I guess I was wrong"" 

I then received messages from her friends telling me I'm a horrible person and she deserves so much better than me. Her mother (unpleasant person) called me saying she was calling the police on me (??) and that i was abusive. She also brought up my weight and said that it was ""laughable that i would break up with her looking the way i do"" and I ""would never get anyone better"". 

All of this was stressing me out to the extreme. I hate confrontation in any form and I think i was just constantly shaking the whole evening.

My girlfriend's friend ended up calling me on a different number and said that she and her boyfriend weren't comfortable letting my girlfriend stay over at their house anymore. They were freaked out due to my gf screaming abuse at me on the phone, and she was apparently screaming at them as well and saying she was going to kill me. 

All her other friends at the house were freaked out too and she was effectively uninvited from their NYE night and they were trying to find a way to get her to leave. 

She was telling them that she had no money and no way of getting to her parents. This was just a straight up lie, I had given her £500 several days ago. I sent her an extra £100 out of guilt anyway.

I don't know where she went for a few hours but she came back to my house around 2am and started trying to kick the door in and picked up a rock and tried to smash the window (it broke the window but didn't smash all the way through). She was screaming and crying through the letter box. I ended up caving and letting her in once she calmed down somewhat, as my brother was there with me to back me up.

She was drunk and tried to attack me but I  held her back. Eventually she just started crying. I felt really bad for her at this point and was almost ready to let her stay just for the night, but thankfully my brother ended up getting a taxi with her to take her to a hotel for the night.

I felt really terrible the next day. I loved her and we spent two years together. I keep wondering if she's right, that I will never find anyone again. I can't see why anyone would want me. I also feel really guilty for what I did and I was probably too harsh on her to just kick her out like that. 

Her mother came to collect her stuff yesterday and started screaming at me, saying that I ruined her daughter's life etc etc. I feel really bad. 

I hope she's okay and I want her to get help and realise why she treats people the way she does. I know I wasn't the first, I brushed off so many stories about her and just ignored all the signs. 

With the weight loss, I am currently continuing my diet instead of water fasting like i planned. I want to try and do a sustainable diet instead of just starving myself for a month and probably gaining it back. I want to try a 7 day water fast to detox though.

I also need to stop relying on alcohol to relax in the evening, it was a big reason I gained the weight. I realised I have been consuming at least 600 calories a day in alcohol alone (3 pints of beer). I definitely used it to cope with stress and I need to develop better coping mechanisms.

I'm going to lose all the weight in 2020 and I'm also going to get into therapy so I can sort my head out, there are so many unhealthy thoughts i have and i don't think hating yourself as much as I do is normal.

I feel sad but strangely relieved and like I can actually make changes in my life without her. 




**TLDR**; found out my gf was behind abusive anonymous texts i have been receiving for months, dumped her by text on nye, caused a bit of chaos and she tried to break into my house and smash my windows.

"I (36F) cheated on my now wife (35F), then GF 10 years ago and now she wants to divorce…we have a newborn and a toddler, how do we coparent when she’s avoiding me and the kids?","
Hello everyone, like the title says I made a terrible decision years ago at a low point in my life, had an affair with a friend. My then GF found out and we broke up but got back together after only a few months apart after I told her how remorseful I was and how much I loved her. I’ve since worked on myself and been in therapy. I can say that I’m def not that same person.

My wife and I have been pretty solid ever since, getting married, having two kids but I got blindsided by her asking for a divorce saying she’s never been able to get past the cheating and that a recent text from a friend we had around that time triggered her and she just can’t be with me anymore.

I’ve asked and begged, suggesting therapy and ways to get out of the negative thought patterns because we’ve been genuinely happy. But she says she can’t, she’s been hurting and hiding these feelings for the last decade. 

I’m devastated, I’m depressed but I’m trying to keep it together for the kids. I’ve told her that we can divorce because I love her and won’t fight it if it brings her so much pain but lll need help with our girls, one is only four weeks old. I’ve also asked if there’s another person, there’s not and I believe her. 

We’ve agreed to coparent and live together despite an official separation but she’s been distant and avoidant. I’m carrying the physical, emotional, and mental load of caring for both kids and she just works or leaves. I’m not sure what to do or say because I know she’s hurting but so am I. I’m losing my wife and my best friend. Do I just let everything go and ignore her presence in the house? Do I move out with the kiddos since I’m already doing everything? Do I yell at her to be more involved (our toddler is biologically hers and our newborn, I carried via donor)? Do I stop trying to talk like we’re friends? Or do I tough it out until she decides to be a mom again? 

EDIT: just adding some info here, we are both women. My wife is the one that proposed, she initiated house shopping and while I brought up kids, she wasn’t opposed. The text was just a hey how are you from a person that we associated with that is good friends with the affair partner (both I haven’t spoken to in 10 years). I am also not trying to reconcile with my wife. I just want her to be happy and we have both agreed on a divorce. We have also both agreed to coparent and live together to do so but she’s been unable to put in the effort. I am actively trying to engage her more with the kids and also talking to her *in a friendly manner* to make sure she’s doing okay. My mindset is that in order to be good coparents we need to at least be able to communicate. Prior to the text, we were communicating amazingly, jokes and affection (we are each other’s person) and I don’t know, I think it just brought up bad memories she can’t get out of. 

UPDATE EDIT: thank you to everyone who responded constructively. My wife and I have talked. She doesn’t want to leave me and the kids alone, she wants to coparent and doesn’t want to move out. She is just having a hard time and is depressed, she is going to make an appointment with her doctor. She also admits she loves me, that I’m her best friend but just cannot forget the affair. I’m going to give her space from me as her wife, have started looking into divorce attorneys for us, and will stick to just communicating about the kids and be cordial otherwise.  I hope to give her the time and space she needs to heal (and have told her it will be okay if she needs to move out in order to do so). ",1725215997.0,ThrowRAblackberry12,relationship_advice
I (f25) insulted my boyfriend (m25) after I found out his secret,"

Throwaway account because I don't really use reddit.

My boyfriend Ben(28m) and I(25f) have been dating for almost two years. While our relationship is not perfect it's pretty damn close, our biggest disagreement was when I switched oat milk brands and he kept forgetting and bringing the other brand. We're both quite naturally calm people and prefer a constructive discussion to a heated argument. This is why what happened last week caught me off guard.

Towards the beginning of our relationship when we weren't exclusive, Ben had a fling with a coworker, lets called her Stef. He is the head of IT at a major firm and she works in a different department so they only see eachother occasionally, even more so now that he switched to remote work two days a week. When he told me about their fling and I talked to my friends about it they said I wasn't allowed to be bothered about it as our relationship wasn't defined at the time and they only slept together once. Somedays I will fixate on it and wonder if he talked to Stef at work and if she still fancied him. I know I'm not allowed to monitor his interactions with anyone and would never try to control him but it does make me feel something when I think about him even being near her. I don't know if it's jealousy or insecurity or even if it's rational.

Anyway last week we got invited to a dinner party hosted by his boss. I'd been to a couple of his office parties before but only interacted with a couple people and usually was glued to Ben's side all night since I am a bit of an introvert. From my immediate impression Ben's boss is a bit of a rich prick, but he knew how to throw a good enough party that I began to loosen up and interact with more than two people all night. As a teacher I've always felt insecure around people who make so much more money than me and always felt like they looked down on me but that couldn't have been further from the truth. I was immediately included on the inside jokes, made a couple of my own and even got invited to a double date with one of his coworkers and his wife. 

While Ben was grabbing me some food, one his friend's made a passing comment about Stef, she was at the party but stayed away from the group we were hanging out with. I said ""I don't care about her but I also have nothing to talk to her about"" which is true, I wasn't about to go compare notes with her and the fact that she did stay away from us did put me at ease and made me not as wary of her. His friend laughed and said 'well then you'd might feel the same way about Molly'. Molly was another coworker of Ben's who I had actually gotten on with the whole night. I was confused and didn't understand what he was trying to stay, when he saw my reaction he completely clammed up but I demanded he explain himself. Another one of his friend's from the group said that Molly and Ben slept together- to say I was shocked is an understatement. I then asked how many other girls Ben had slept with from the office and they told me they knew of four different girls. 

At that point Ben came back, unaware his friends had spilled his secrets but picked up on the tense atmosphere. Internally I was fuming and hurt but I kept a cool facade and when Ben asked what was wrong I just looked at him and said 'your friends were just informing me that you're the office slut'. He looked shocked and I left to go to the bathroom to calm down. I knew if I stayed at this party any longer I would have a breakdown and needed to leave. So I went straight to our car and drove home without telling him.

When I got back home I replied to his numerous texts about where I was and told him I came home and he could find his own way back. He got home around an hour after me and by that time I had already cried my feelings out and was ready to have a conversation. He came into the house absolutely livid which I didn't understand because he was the one who lied to me. He's never even raised his voice at me for anything before but he was shouting about how I embarrassed him and word had gotten around to his other coworkers because I reacted immaturely. I tried to explain my position that how would he feel if he found out I had slept with four of my coworkers and never told him. He just kept reiterating that he never had a relationship with them and it was just sex.

I knew going into our relationship he was way more experienced than me sexually but I refuse to believe he could sleep with these women and not feel anything for them but that is beside the point and he should've told me. But all he is hung up on is that I insulted him to his friends. When he was done yelling he said he was going to stay at his brother's house to calm down and not to contact him until he cooled down, I told him I wouldn't contact him first because I'm not in the wrong, he is.

It's been a week since he's been at his brother's house and we still haven't talked. I have no clue where we go from here. Was I wrong to react the way I did? I didn't think I was but now I'm second guessing myself. I didn't think calling him the office slut would elicit this reaction but I don't think it was a lie either. Should I apologise or wait for him to make the first move? My issue is not so much with him sleeping with the other women but hiding it.

UPDATE: I just want to say thanks for everyone's response, I can't reply to them all but I have read what everyone has written and just need to clarify a few things.

1. We had discussed previous partners but he omitted ONS as he didn't consider them partners and only told me about girlfriends he had. Ben is my first boyfriend and I had only ever slept with one guy before but that man wasn't my boyfriend either but I still disclosed it 

2. There is some speculation I went through his phone and badger him about Stef, that is not true at all. I knew my issues with Stef were my own and never made him answer for them. Even when he told me I was slightly upset but again it was something we discussed and I got advice from my friends about we moved forward from

3. I did not yell out the comment I made, it was only in front of Ben and two of his work friends. I did not ask his friends who the other two girls were as I thought that should come from Ben. I don't know when the encounters with the other 3 girls happened 

4. I am aware my comment was wrong and I am fully ready to apologise for that and for leaving his stranded, he had to get a lift from his brother. In my post I wrote our car, that's not true I just think of it that way because I use it more but its actually his car 

5. I made a typo in the title, I'm 25 and Ben is 28

Anyway an actual update - I texted him this morning saying 'Hey, I know you asked me not to contact you first but I've given you a week and really feel like we need to have a conversation. I hope you've been doing okay.' I didn't want to start apologising or questioning him over text. I did that about 6.30 before I left for work and was teaching all day so I knew I wouldn't be able to constantly check my phone. It's lunch time right now and he's responded saying he's at work, which is confusing because Friday and Monday are his remote work days so I don't understand why he's gone in. I texted back and said 'we can talk after work if he wanted to come home' and he agreed. I honestly have no clue how tonight is going to go - I really don't want to break up.

I know alot of you are gonna say I don't have a backbone for messaging him first but I haven't been able to eat or sleep all week and this been so mentally and physically exhausting, my workload this week has been crushing and this added stress has made me reach my limit. 

UPDATE 2: Hey everyone its Saturday and im still in bed and thought I should give an update. Before I do I just wanted to clarify one thing. I switched from alpro to oatly, and its much better. Also I'm paraphrasing since I can't remember everything we said. 

So I was quite nervous about Ben coming over after work, I was meant to do some work but was too distracted to even attempt it. I did however as a gesture of good faith decide to cook his favourite meal for him and maybe use it as an icebreaker. I did take someone's advice of writing everything down just so I could keep my thoughts clear. 

After work I texted asking him what time he would be over and he said he'd text me when he left work and takes him about a 30 minutes on the tube to reach home. He got here about 6ish and rang the doorbell (which was so weird, he still had his keys), I opened the door and we kinda awkwardly greeted each other. Immediate impression was that he didn't look angry or upset, just cold. 

I sat down on the sofa and expected him to join me but he just stood in the middle of the room with his hands in his trousers. I said I was glad he came over and he just nodded, then I said it was weird being in his house by myself all week and all he said was 'I'm sure it was'. He asked me why I texted him now and not sooner and I said it was because he told me not to contact him. I told him I'd been miserable and that I was sorry for the comment I made and leaving and especially for taking his car. He said he didn't give a shit about the car just that I had left without telling him. I got a chance to finally explain myself to him, I never cared how many women he slept with before. (I'd known he was a bit of a 'fuckboy' before we got together, and never held it against him) I just hated being blindsided and feeling like I knew less about my boyfriend than some random coworkers. I asked why he didn't just tell me since he knew I'd be around them and he said he said honestly didn't think it was important and matter to me. I called bullshit because he knows how I am and he knew it would matter. 

He admitted he did regret sleeping with those women as he never thought about having to bring his future girlfriend around them and tell her about it. Two of them happened when he first joined the company straight of uni, one of those girls has left already and the other is actually dating Ben's friend who told me about Molly. He said at that point of his life he was fine sleeping around and never really thought of the consequences. I asked why his friend decided to even say anything to me about it and he said they always try to 'piss eachother off' and one thing that gets Ben annoyed is when someone brings up his fuckboy ways. He said after I left his friends felt bad for what they said but I told him I never would've reacted that way if I had known and he should've told me. He said I was trying to justify my response after apologising. 

I told him I didn't want to do that, I do genuinely think what I said and did was wrong but he can't put all the blame on me. He said the only thing he could apologise for is sleeping with a bunch of women and since that was before me it didn't make any sense. I kept saying it was the hiding bit that upset me and he asked what difference would it had made if I had known? I did think about that for a moment, I still would've gone but I think I would've been a bit more hyperaware of the Molly and the other girl. He said he wanted me to be there and have a good time and didn't want ruin it by telling me about irrelevant shit in his past and I guess I understood that sentiment because I decided to let it go. 

We both were quiet there for a moment and he asked if 'I was done?' And if I was going to end it then I needed to pick another reason since 'this would be the stupidest fucking reason'. I told him I didn't want to break up and that we needed to talk about everything but I wanted him to come sit next to me and he did. So I asked if there were any others and he said no, I asked him who knew in the office and he said only his friend group and they keep their mouth shut to everyone because all of them we're doing the same shit. He told me he slept with Molly right before we met. 

I was curious about why he went into work today when it was his remote work day and he said that his nieces wouldn't let him concentrate at home so he just decided to go in. He did say he was furious last week and didn't know if he could move forward but talking to his brother helped and he calmed him down, he said if I didn't text him he was planning on contacting me first today anyway so we could talk. 

So we didn't break up, I apologised and while he didn't so the same I have decided to let it go and move on. I told him I made his favourite meal and he finally kissed me and told me he missed me. 

Anyway I know someone of you are gonna say he should've dumped me straight away or I should've demanded an apology but I'm happy with the outcome. I finally had a meal and good night's sleep, even Ben said I looked like I had lost weight. Thank for the people who have messaged me offering me advice and I really hope I never have to give another update.

I have to do something really hard and I need you guys to encourage me. It's going to break my daughter's heart.,"About ten years ago my abusive marriage ended. I was really messed up at the time and impulsively jumped into a very brief marriage with another man that ended weeks later. Unfortunately, it was long enough to get me pregnant.

Long story short, this man disappeared for six years after the baby was born. At first I was merely relieved because he took so much of my energy. But as my daughter grew, she yearned to have a dad in her life. On a whim one day, I tracked down his parents online and reached out. Soon after that he contacted us again.

We've been in contact for a couple years now. We talk most evenings as part of our daughter's bedtime routine. Soon after we reconnected, both my daughter and I stayed at his place two weeks. It went well so we then arranged for her to visit him on her own. That also seemed to go well.

There have been a few concerns but overall, I felt okay arranging another visit this year. Last time we arranged an unaccompanied minor flight but policies changed so this year we decided I would fly on the plane with her.

Things didn't go as planned. A flight got cancelled and I found myself unexpectedly staying with him and our daughter on the first night of the trip. This time, he didn't have weeks of warning before I showed up.

Ladies, it's bad. Really, really bad.

I'm pretty sure he was drunk when he showed up to pick us up from the airport. He smelled like tequila and was acting strangely. He has a history with alcohol so I asked him to not drink at all while she's with him. ETA: We were on public transit and he wasn't drunk driving. As many pointed out, I would absolutely not have gotten in a vehicle with a drunk driver.

Then we got to his place and it is absolutely filthy. I mean, the smell hit me before I walked through the door. There is a layer of grime everywhere. The litter box has more poop than litter. A puddle of dried pee was caked on the floor behind the bathroom door. I went to wash clothes and the was a line of poop caught in the drainage holes at the front of the washer. Huge, big turds, not like little bits from cleaning up after an accident. The coffee maker has old coffee going moldy in it. And so forth.

I absolutely can't leave my daughter here.

While I know that and am planning to take her back home with me tomorrow, it's not easy. I'm going to have to face my little girl and tell her that the two week visit she was looking forward to for months is now over. ~~I will be putting in jeopardy her ongoing relationship with a man that she adores.~~

(Edited to stop blaming myself.)

To make things worse, all the stress of traveling has gotten me sick but I have no coverage out of state. I have another day and a half of high stress traveling ahead of me as I navigate flights with a young child, one who will be very unhappy.

I just want to be safe at home with my little girl right now. 😭😭😭

Edited to add: Daughter and I are gone from dad's house. Dad didn't make any trouble. Flight isn't until tonight but I told them this morning and we left right away. We've been at the mall all day.

Daughter was absolutely heartbroken. Cried, got a little angry, told me she wasn't going, cried more when I told her it wasn't optional. Then after we had left, slowly talked about the things that made her uncomfortable about dad. I'm not sure if she truly understands or is just accepting the inevitable but she's doing alright.

I might not have time to read any more comments until tomorrow but I just wanted to thank you all for your support and understanding.",1703662645.0,DeCryingShame,TwoXChromosomes

Please encourage the older woman in your life to leave their lazy POS husbands.,"Speaking on behalf of my boyfriend’s family who moved in with us after being kicked out of their trailer park rental.

The dad never cooked, never cleaned, never washed the dishes, never made the bed or did the laundry. Never checked the kids homework, or cleaned up the cat litter. As a matter of fact, if one of the animals peed on the floor, he would step over it and call someone else to clean it up. He hasn’t been to the grocery store in 6+ years to buy anything but beer for himself.

All of this while not having a job and sitting around all day drinking. 

On the other hand, the mom works 14+ hour long days and has a second part-time job on the weekend. After she comes home from work, she would make the children dinner/ do the laundry/ whatever needed to be done.

Well, she finally got sick of it after 22 years of marriage. She filed for divorce, took the kids and moved out 🥳.

The dad is still living with us (until January 1st!) but it honestly aggravates me sooo much.

Yesterday, he cooked for the first time in 6 months. He also washed all of his own dishes.  The day before he did his own laundry, and vacuumed his room.  He went grocery shopping (for himself) this week, and was complaining to me about how high the cost of everything is. (And how he hasn’t made his own bed in 22 years)

I’m so angry on her behalf. He CLEARLY knew how to do all of these things before.  Yet, was just taking advantage of her and everyone else.

Update: looking for encouragement while caring for my palliative husband,"My husband passed on Sept 19. I’m very sad to say I didn’t make it there to hold his hand as he left this existence and that is something I will live with forever. 
However, 6 days later I discovered he was cheating on me for most of our relationship. Confirmed by emails he somehow didn’t delete with pictures of her naked in my apartment (thank god not in my bed). He even bought her sex toys last April (around when we got engaged). No emails after that, but that means nothing really. He didn’t protect me or her from this. I’ve got every detail of her life, her full name and address, phone number & email. She lived around the corner from the hospital he was in, I wonder if she visited him while I wasn’t there when he was dying. I’m supposed to pick up his cremated remains next week and spread them where he wanted. Not sure what to do now, to be honest.

Will my parents know who I voted for if I vote early?,"I'm a 19F and this year my parents have been very pushy about me voting for their presidental candidate. I'm going to be going to vote tomorrow or Tuesday at a polling center in my area early. The problem is I don't want to vote for the same party as them and would prefer another party. If I vote for the other party when I go alone to the polling center early will they know? 

I don't wanna risk getting kicked out of my living situation for who I voted for. I've been upset this entire week because of how pushy my father has been with ""voting for the right people and not the wrong option"". The thought of my family disowning me for who I'm voting for makes me sick to my stomach. If they can somehow find out I think I'm better off lying to them.

Can anyone help me out please? I'm desperate at this point. Could you also provide me with some resources? Thanks for reading.

Edit: I appreciate all the kind words and everyone giving me information. I really needed to hear some of things you've all been saying to me. I have anxiety and have been suffering pretty much my entire life with decision making.

I just wanna add that I'm for sure safe. My parents don't go through my stuff cause otherwise I would've been outted a long time ago lol. I doubt I'd be kicked out either, but the mindspace I was in earlier after the awkward car ride I had with them made think it was a possibility.

Edit 2: Okay now that it's been a few hours and my panic attack has long since passed I just wanna give my current thoughts.

For starters I wanna thank everyone so much for giving me support and helping me out with information about my voting rights and what laws I have in my state. You all have been so helpful on educating me and kind to me and I cannot thank you all enough for that. Your encouragement and support has truly warmed my heart.

Second I'm feeling so much more comfortable and confident going to the polls and voting for who I want now that I know more about what exactly my rights are and that I'll be in the booth alone. I know in a few weeks this will all long since passed and things will return to normalcy, but at the moment having a clear mind is insanely helpful when making rational decisions.

Lastly I just wanna reiterate that I am okay, I am safe and my living situation is all good. Earlier I was in the middle of a panic attack all by myself and I truly did believe my parents would kick me out. Now that I'm in a better state of mind I know that that would likely never happen and I was just thinking irrationally at a mile a minute. Even in the millions of possibilities that did happen I do have somewhere to go and their home is close by.

I was originally just gonna delete this post, but leaving it up for other people in a similar situation to me is definitely the way to go. Again I wanna thank you all from the bottom of my heart for helping me out in these trying times.",1728838009.0,Mibge,TwoXChromosomes

Me, who do you want as president? 

Her, well he's too old and she's never done anything. Least ways that is what they're saying (Facebook is saying she means)

Me, well she is currently the vp of the USA so there's her doing that. 

Her, well i didn't know that. But why a woman? What's wrong with the man? 

Me, mom. Republicans want to make D and Cs illegal. 

Her, what?!?! Why? Those are so important! It's it just because some women use them for other things? 

Me, yes mom

Her, that's literally nobodies business! It's her body it should be her choice! 

I used the word dnc instead of abortion because mother has had one of those to save her life. She understands that word. 

Now to be fair I was actually *very* worried about how she reacted and answered. She was the one to encourage me to get an abortion as a teen. But with her that might not mean much. I mean half our family are POC and she still manages to be racist ( albeit she is better than years ago).

Make sure your vote was counted - encourage friends & family to as well if you feel comfortable.,"This is copy and pasted directly from a comment on the Kamala Harris subreddit.

If this election is of interest to you, I recommend reading it as well and doing your own research.

As the count currently stands:

In GA, she is down by less than 130k.

In PA, she is down less than 150k.

In WI, she is down 20k.

In MI, she is down 80k.

In NC she is down Less than 150k.

In NV she is down less than 50k

In AZ she is down less than 185k.

We did not listen to Maga lie for 4 years, about illegal voting for us to lay down when so many are on social media pointing out their vote was thrown out.

She worked way too hard for us to not try for her. 

We owe it to her if nothing else to try. Just check your ballots, please. Regardless if it’s a blue or red state. She won or lost.  This could be the difference down ballot.

We can't just sit here. We have to make sure we have a fair shot. If a recount is done and we lost, then so be it. But Maga received recounts off of Trump making claims.

Yes, it must be within a certain percentage point for her to request a recount by law. But still, the states did in 2020 because Trump demanded it and he was lying.

You find your vote wasn't counted or suddenly not registered, hit socials, and post a video with evidence. Call your local office. Hell, call your local news.

They are working too hard on Twitter to spread this narrative that people didn't want to vote for a Black South Asian Woman, and she only got “66 million votes.""

Bullshit.

That isn’t tracking. 

As it stands, she is currently less than 4 million behind him.

"""People are rebellious and they
take risks. By saying SA is 100% the
fault of the man, it encourages
women to take unnecessary risks.""","A man commented this on a TikTok where I made a joke that if I were to be attacked by a bear, no one would ask what I was wearing (I stitched to a different video where a woman said she would be less afraid of encountering a bear than a man. 

This was his response. I suggested that maybe men should be taught to respect consent better then, but he countered with rapists don't care and that's why they can't be stopped. 

I don't think that's true. Statistically,rapists are known to the victim. Yes, they should know right from wrong but they rarely admit to it. They hide behind the same logical fallacies rape apologists do. She shouldn't have gotten drunk, she should have worn a longer skirt, she shouldn't have gotten in the car with him.

I'm trying to think of a good script to reply to this type of thinking. Not because I can change this mans mind, but to educate other people who might have the same logic or encounter this logic. ",1710956399.0,Ephemeralwriting,TwoXChromosomes
Update: Will my parents know who I voted for if I vote early?,"I thought I'd give everyone a minor update as to what went on after my last post. To cut to the chase, everything went great!

My mom took me to the polling center earlier today and I went in by myself with my voting card. Before I went in she told me to vote for whoever I wanted (though I did tell her I voted for the same canidiate as her and my dad just to avoid useless family drama).

The people there were kind, helpful, and very happy that a young person was voting. According to them I was the first young person in their center so far.

I filled my info out and went over to a booth to vote for my own canidiate (which I'm sure many of you can tell who it was judging by the comments on my last post lol). Once I was done I put in the machine and I was done! It was alot easier and less nerveracking than I was expecting if I'm being honest. 

I managed to keep my emotions under control and my mom didn't suspect anything at all and fully believed I chose her and my dad's canidiate as my pick (which my dad did too). Plus going in by myself was really nice cause I didn't feel intimated at all.

I wanna give another thanks to everyone for encouraging me and being so kind! I'm really happy I was able to step out and vote cause earlier this year I genuinely don't think I would've had the guts to do it without a push. So thanks again everyone for helping me out!",1729127783.0,Mibge,TwoXChromosomes
I’m so scared to bring my daughter to a doctor in our state.,"I’m not sure if this post will go through, but I need advice. My 15-year-old daughter is about 8 weeks pregnant.

The baby’s father could be her ex-boyfriend, who’s her age, or a 22-year-old man she won’t name. She’s protecting him, but I’m fairly certain it’s the older man based on phone records and his social media, which links him to one of her friends.

I want to press charges against him for statutory rape, but I’m hesitant because of my state’s strict abortion laws. While there’s an exception for rape, I’m worried a judge might not allow her to terminate the pregnancy without definitive proof of paternity. My daughter is still undecided about whether to keep the baby or seek an abortion, and I want her to have all options available.

To protect her , I’ve been driving 4 hours to an out-of-state OB-GYN because I don’t trust local doctors to prioritize her life if complications arise, especially under these laws.

My questions are 
1.	Am I overreacting by waiting to press charges until she’s made a firm decision around her pregnancy ?
2.	If the 22-year-old is the father, could he or his family claim parental rights despite his crime?
Sorry if this is scattered—my mind is overwhelmed.

Edit: I guess I forgot some context but as of now she wants to keep the baby but as of recently she’s been opening up to the possibility of terminating the pregnancy. Which is why I asked the second question of could that 22 year old have parental rights? Because that’s something that will influence her decision to not want to keep the baby. I don’t want to strong arm her and force her to have an abortion even though that’s what I want..I still know how emotional an abortion can be. ",1732325124.0,OkSteak551,TwoXChromosomes
RFK prediction,"I had a short, friendly chat with a coworker who is also into hiking. I’m 46 and mentioned that long downhills are harder on my knees as I get older. He said “you don’t have to just accept knee pain—cut out dairy and you’ll reduce inflammation and your knees will feel better.” He followed this with “I don’t understand people who won’t make changes to improve their health”. 

He knows nothing about my diet. (I rarely eat dairy bc it bothers my stomach.) 

Based on this and other casual conversations he really believes lifestyle choices prevent or cure most ailments. 

With RFK heading up HHS my prediction is that the “lifestyle choice” approach to health is going to be embedded in public policy. 

RFK is not going to regulate the practices of large corporations. I predict he will tie most illness to “lifestyle choice” (with or without evidence) and “encourage” improved lifestyle choices by allowing insurance companies to stop covering or reduce coverage for “lifestyle” related illness. 

My prediction is that if you are sick or need healthcare, it will be your fault in this administration. Personal responsibility! 

It won’t be much of a leap. I’m 5’2” and wear size 14/16. I recently got access to my medical records online going back years. My first visit to my dr to ask about knee pain said nothing about knee pain but did note that I’m “severely morbidly obese”. At the same appointment blood test show no other health issues—I’m active and have normal blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, etc. 

I haven’t figured out what weight I need to be in order to access healthcare, but be prepared for this to extend to pretty much any and all health needs. ",1732275897.0,Impossible_Ad9324,TwoXChromosomes
I had a huge win today and I want to share it in case it encourages anyone else,"I don't really post here - I'm much happier lurking - but something happened today and you lot are among the first I thought to tell.

I'm a web developer, which is still very much a male-dominated industry. It's getting better but realistically women only last 5 years in tech before they just can't be arsed with the patriarchy anymore.

Recently I found out my team has hired a new guy to join my team. The last guy was pretty useless, and was getting paid only a bit less than me for really poor work. (They are happy he left!) So naturally I was desperate to know what this new guy's experience level was, and what he's getting paid!

I did NOT want to have this conversation with anyone, especially as I have serious anxiety, but I made myself ask. I mentioned that a gender pay gap still exists in my industry, and that I need to know where I sit within the team, and if I'm being paid fairly. 

I saw this going one of three ways: 

1) They'd tell me he had more experience, 
2) They'd lie about his salary, or 
3) They'd realise they should increase my salary to match

You know where this is going, because I called it a huge win, but I really didn't think 3) was actually an option!! But I got the call this morning saying I was right, and it wouldn't be fair to pay him more just because he's newer, and they have increased my salary to match his. And promised transparency going forward. 

I know so many of us hate talking about money, especially with male bosses. But we have a right to the same pay, and you CAN ask for it and get it. Also, there ARE dudes out there who will listen, and actually pay you what is fair.

And if you're a guy reading this - especially if you have under-represented coworkers - thank you for reading this far. You can be an ally to the people in your team who are too scared to ask for what they deserve.",1675872084.0,atewithoutatable-3,TwoXChromosomes
Waitressing has really opened my eyes about marriage. ,"I 22F, have been waitressing for a minute. I’ve seen a lot and heard a lot. This job has taught me that marrying the right person is extremely important. A few weeks ago, I was completely berated by a gentleman who came in with his young daughter and his wife. We had a terrible wait time and this dude literally started cursing at me in the vicinity of children. I couldn’t even explain what was going on and how I was willing to help him. I got so flustered that I had to walk away. He then flagged down my manager and told him I gave him an attitude for a free meal. Imagine being married to a man who curses out complete strangers.  I don’t think i’ll ever forget the look on his wife and daughters face. I could see they were both embarrassed and frightened. I also noticed men rarely order for their children nor are they as keen on sharing allergies. They sometimes make inappropriate comments in the presence of their wives. Men often are disengaged. I’ve also noticed that sometimes their significant other has to encourage them to tip. On the other hand, I’ve had awesome male guests! They were kind, respectful, and patient. From our brief interactions, I could tell they were awesome husbands. An example was a dad who came in dressed up w/ his family and was so so pleasant. You could tell him and his wife were the best of friends. That’s all I pray for lol. ",1727752890.0,FlimsyBee7501,TwoXChromosomes

My boyfriend of 5 years just told me he no longer finds me desirable because I lost an eye.,"My partner/boyfriend (M, 50s) of 5 years just told me (F, 40s) he no longer finds me attractive since my brain surgery that caused me to lose one eye. So he has gotten a mistress in her 20s for sex. 

I have an eyepatch now and probably will for the rest of my life. But really?!!!! 

I’m not even sure what to do with this.

I’m still recovering so can’t quite leave yet (we live together). But I’m just in shock.

Besides the 10 pounds I gained and the eye patch. I look the same as I did when we started dating.

I’m a former model but I wasn’t when we met. I did my best to find a man that I thought wasn’t with me solely for my looks (cause I knew one day they would go). 

The irony is I stood with  him through chemo. He lost his hair and then he gained 25 pounds and I still made sure he felt desirable. 

Im mad at myself for letting this put me in a deep depression. My surgery was a two months ago.Strangers still compliment me on my looks.. I graciously say thank you and move on. So I still believe at least one man will still find me attractive with an eyepatch.

But I just feel awful cause this one person who Ive shared my life with looks at me with disgust. So I cry and then I get mad at myself for crying.

I keep thinking he is crazy but that doesn’t stop the tears. 

So I guess I’m just asking for encouragement from people who are on the other side of leaving an unappreciative partner and now with a good one. And really any encouragement.

I know I’ll get to the other side. But right now this stinks.

To the men on here. It is encouraging to see some comments about you learning from some of our experiences.,"There is one thing I will ask. Please hold the men in your sphere of influence accountable. Don’t let your friend be the subject of one of our terrifying stories. If you can spread your enlightenment, you may be saving lives. 

Women are still blamed for violence against them by people saying that they should leave or better defend themselves. From the time we are children, we are seeking, discussing, and given tips on how to defend ourselves. As men, you know that not every violent situation can be prepared for. There will always be someone stronger or that has some other situational advantage. Men need to hear reason from other men. There are some who will listen to you. Please speak up. 

I have been in situations where the men around me would have lost nothing to say something, but still did nothing. They knew I was married, but did nothing to deter the man that harassed me. One of them had teenage daughters. There was an office I used to work in that sold oilfield and industrial supplies. A regional salesman came in one day to consult on a difficult contracted customer. I was showing him the communication I had with said customer when he sat on my chair and put his hands on my body. I had offered him his own chair. My two male coworkers that I until that day respected just watched. I left the room in tears. They said that was just his personality. I reported that guy, and he was banned from entering our offices ever again. My manager, a man, was one of the first people to teach me that I was worth standing up for.

For those of you who don’t know the grandfather effect or any similar term means that it takes roughly 2-3 generations for something to become traditional. This means that future generations will go thinking that it was always like this for hundreds of years when in reality it took effect only two generations ago. 

I get so tired of seeing videos and shorts that encourage women to back to being SAHM or bang maids because that’s how our ancestors were for thousands of years and you can’t fight against evolution and yet how can you expect more from people who never dug into history outside of school? They don’t realize that the housewives phenomenon was a result of extraordinary circumstances of a post war period that was unique in history; when governments actually cared about the returning veterans and created policies that made it easier to buy homes and provide for a family on a single income while also making sure the women who were content with the jobs they were doing when the war broke out were pushed out into these roles. 

Now the people who grew up and worked before the wars have been dead for decades and the elders we have today who were nothing but children during this time are going around telling how awesome it was because daddy went to work and came home to a warm meal and watched TV on the couch until it was time to sleep ; while also floating the idea that women were much happier because they never noticed mommy was taking drugs just to function in her never ending unpaid job of being a housewife. 

As always this unique time period in history won’t last long anyways and eventually come to an end and I think we are all witnessing it but the people it benefited the most are trying to hold onto the status quo. ",1725685597.0,laughwithesinners,TwoXChromosomes
[TW] Turns out one of the biggest streamers on Twitch is basically a slave to her abusive husband.,"[Article](https://news.yahoo.com/living-fancy-prison-twitch-onlyfans-164247725.html)

Amouranth is one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, period. She's been streaming games on the platform for years, and more recently was one of the first big creators to pivot into regular ""hot-tub"" streams. She's also a prolific OnlyFans creator. It has just come to light that she's been in an extremely abusive relationship since 2016. And this came out from her unmuting her stream while he was berating her to the point of tears over the phone. It's a long stream and not everything is in the article, so here's the rundown. This is where the TW gets real.

* He forced her to do a 24 hour uninterrupted stream, saying that he'd kill her dogs if she didn't
* He threatened to kick her out of the house for mishearing him
* Apparently it was his ""idea"" for her to switch to hot tub streams, and people think he might be ""encouraging"" her to produce as much OnlyFans content as she does. Either way, he definitely takes all the money from both, which lead us to...
* ""I built this empire off your body."" Because that's how you talk to your wife. He's forcing her to do provocative content around the clock and taking the proceeds. He's a pimp for his ***wife***, and he ***admits*** it.
* Text messages show that he controls all of her finances, and has threatened to sink her life's savings into crypto speculations if she crosses him. Very Britney.
* He wouldn't let her even reveal that she was married, because he thought that her presenting as a single woman doing OF and tub streams was more profitable.
* Here we get more into user (and me) speculation. She streams anywhere from 12-16 hours a day, usually in a pool/hot tub with multiple outfit changes and sub goals for squats and such. And when she isn't streaming, she does a lot of OnlyFans. As the dog clip shows, these long stream segments may be coerced. She seems to hardly sleep. She's fallen asleep onstream before, and she occasionally streams herself sleeping (alone, in her room) at night. She presents as a single woman, including sleeping apart from her husband on a livestream to bring in cash while she isn't even awake. And all of her income goes into an account under her husband's control. A lot of things are falling into place for me. Nearly every time I open Twitch, she's live to thousands of people. I thought she was just grinding, because she rakes in ludicrous amounts of money from donos/subs/OF/etc. But it looks like she was basically working in a sweatshop for some Alvin and the Chipmunks sounding asshole who the Internet didn't know existed for six years.

This is horrifying. Abuse can happen to anyone, and anyone can be made to feel powerless. Amouranth is one of the biggest Twitch streamers. She's friends with a dozen other massive creators. She has an audience of millions. And she was under the thumb of an abusive faceless man, and the only way she could start the conversation of getting the word out that she wasn't safe was to keep her stream going during an abusive outburst. She had to show herself crying and being berated to a live audience of thousands because that was the only way she could start the process of exposing her pain. She felt like she couldn't just leave, file for divorce, or reach out to her friends (none of them knew any of this either). I'm just speechless.

**Edit:** A friend of Amouranth's says that she is ""at least physically safe.""

If there's one thing to take away from this, it's the ""I built this empire off your body"" line. Genuinely chilling. When I was digesting all this on my own, that's the one that really broke me.

The vet put this man in a choke hold for over 15 minutes. He died. And  most of the comments are cheering this on and celebrating. I just called  one of them out and here's the reply I got:

**Get the fuck out of here. You’re not in the military, and you wouldn’t even last a second, despite the supposedly low standards.**

**You  are utterly unremarkable. You are below average in looks, height,  strength, and you are a overwhelmingly boring person. When you die, no  one will remember who you are or care. Cheers**

Be  careful out there...men who serve the country aren't entitled to  threaten, intimidate, or abuse you. Ever. I dated a Navy vet for a period of time...alcoholism, verbal abuse, and cheating were the ""reward"" I got for trying to stay for support and encourage him to get help.

I posted this not even to spotlight mental health issues with homeless people in America, I posted this because so many people overlooked disturbing details of what the Marine did simply because he served.

My sister died because doctors didn’t believe her and I still feel so much rage.,"My beautiful perfect sister died in March 2023 at 36. I was driving to work on a Friday morning when I heard she died. We had a trip planned for the weekend. 

We recently learned from the forensic pathologist that she suffered from a genetic heart condition called ARVC/D, wherein the walls of her right ventricle were replaced with scar tissue, causing a deadly arrhythmia. 

I wish I could say that this came out of left field, but she had symptoms. About a year ago, she went to the hospital because her heart would not stop racing and she could feel it skipping beats. She was terrified. As she was in the ER, I remember her texting me that she was worried there was nothing wrong with her and she was overreacting. Instead of reassuring her, the doctors ran a basic EKG and told her she was just “stressed out”. 

After this incident, she went to her PCP with the same concerns. She wore a heart monitor for a week and he ran another EKG. Just like the ER doctor, he told her she must have anxiety. She told me that she knows she’s stressed out, but she didn’t think she was stressed out enough to be having these problems. She didn’t follow up with a cardiologist because she didn’t see the point. I wish to God I would have pushed her more to go. That will haunt me forever. 

Since I learned how she died, I have just been filled with an unquenchable rage. She had her whole life ahead of her. She was the best sister you could ever imagine. She was my best friend. And now she’s lost her future because these doctors just didn’t care enough to ask more questions or run more tests or just fucking BELIEVE her that something wasn’t right. 

There’s no solution, no answers. Just a reminder to ADVOCATE for yourself. Never let a doctor make you feel bad. Never back down and believe what your body is telling you. You know best. Ask for the test. Get a second opinion. You deserve it, and your life may depend on it.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words. I feel like I need to add some clarification, however, based on some of the comments. 

First, for the commenters defending my sister’s doctors, I understand that PCPs and family doctors are some of the most underpaid and under-appreciated medical professionals in the US. Our horrific healthcare system also places an emphasis on minimizing patient interaction so as to maximize profits. I imagine it must be horribly stressful to work in that environment, especially because I think most people go to medical school with a genuine desire to help others. And I get that family doctors are not specialists. I did not expect her primary care doctor to diagnose her with this disease. 

However, when a patient comes to you in distress, with genuine concerns about their heart, your reaction should not be to run the most basic of tests and then tell them that if they just reduce their stress and anxiety, their heart palpitations should stop. And as an afterthought, tell them to see a Cardiologist in an almost defensive manner. 

The purpose of my post was to encourage you to make that appointment, get a second opinion, and listen to your body. To not feel embarrassed and as if you’re burdening your doctor with your issues, and to not back down if you think something is wrong. I saw a few comments from people saying that this motivated them to make an appointment, and that honestly brought tears to my eyes. Perhaps I’m just screaming into the void, but maybe if we all scream loud enough, our echos will reach someone.",1689639695.0,gongacn07,TwoXChromosomes
Fiance cancelled wedding and left me for another - 1 year on update and encouragement,"Hey TwoX..

Some might remember my post a year ago ( https://redd.it/2r8tcg ) which concentrated on how I was finding it a struggle to get through my long awaited wedding being cancelled, and how my ex fiancé became involved with a mutual friend. I'm just here to give a brief update, and hope that my experience may perhaps encourage those in similar situations to keep positive and be inspired to move forward.

Never underestimate how time truly is a wonderful healer. At first you feel as though you are never going to leave the little ball of pain you roll yourself into. Gradually giving yourself the space to grieve (anger, tears, arrogance, however you deal best), making positive health choices both mentally and physically, and keeping yourself busy can help the hurt become less and less each day. Personally, I began singing properly again. I was a self employed music teacher for years and when everything went wrong in my relationship, I stopped making music. I took a brief break, but knew quickly that something I loved doing must never be allowed to stop. Another word of advice is to find a hobby, or rekindle old hobbies. 

Within the last year I feel as though I've achieved a lot. 
I moved to a different city to begin a new job. I slept on a friends sofa for 3 months to save money up to be able to afford to find a room in a shared house. It was hard, my life felt like it was in a suitcase, most of my belongings were stored in my parent's garage, a few hours away. I took all the extra hours that I could and threw myself in to work. Within three months I got a room for myself, then shortly afterwards I got small promotion. I auditioned and joined a fantastic choir, who have done loads of great classical cd releases, I tried the dating game again, venturing in via Tinder, but it didn't go well for me (too many fuckboys).. Had a lapse - drank and smoked a lot and questioned my decisions, whether I was a failure. Picked myself up the best that I could. Moved house again in November. Met a great new man in December. Ex fiancé got back in contact to find out about how I was doing - I told him I felt the best I felt in years and thanked him for breaking it off -  I have a life that I enjoy living. 

I feel as though I laugh every day about something. I often write down in a diary a couple of positive points to my day - could be as simple as a lovely sunrise, or a great talk with a customer, perhaps something to look forward to. 

I don't expect or need responses, I just wanted to say thank you for the advice and encouraging words that I had last year, and that I truly hope that the others who were experiencing things similar to me are doing well. In particular, passing on best wishes to /u/echolawrences and /u/itsmymillertime , whose replies to my original post resonated in my mind.

Fiance's lack of basic life skills is causing a rift ,"My fiance is a good person. He's really sweet and loving, but he didn't have the best upbringing; suffice it to say he had an alcoholic mother and a rageaholic dad. He spent a lot of his youth holed up in his room being depressed. I really love him and I really want to spend the rest of my life with him... Except for one little thing.

He can't cook. He can't clean more than picking up very VERY obvious trash (emphasis on the very because he's got ADHD so sometimes it'll just become part of the scenery to him). I've had to baby him through learning that no, you can't just dump clothes into the washing machine, add soap, and it's good- the clothes need to be sorted, make sure there's nothing in pockets, make sure you're using the right settings, etc. He broke an expensive bra of mine when I asked him to do laundry without me doing all the sorting which is what led to the teaching.

He's 30 years old, and otherwise competent. When I ask him about his thought process (ex: why did you just toss the jeans in when they felt heavier than normal?) he just says ""I don't know"", and because of his dad if I get even a little upset with him he just starts to shut down and I can't get through to him at all. I don't know what to do, I don't want to be his mommy but I really love him, is there any way I can encourage him to change? We are trying to get him therapy but it's been months and they keep saying ""we'll call you to schedule an appointment when we're available"".",1723970564.0,newish00,TwoXChromosomes
I hate my boyfriend and I hate feeling this way,"EDIT.

Thanks to everyone who read and commented. I didn't expect so many people to read this; it's terribly long.

A lot of you are being very encouraging and understanding. Thank you for that. 

Many of you are asking why? Why am I even with this asshole? Why have I put up with it for so long? I should know this is all unacceptable, should've dumped him long ago, and so on. 

I think this is something a lot of people deal with when in bad relationships. Things don't necessarily start off bad. In my own case, things started off great. After he moved in, there were annoyances here and there, but at the time I chalked it up to being due to the adjustments having to be made living with a new person. Living with another person is tough. So I thought many of the inconveniences would dissipate over time. 

Things gradually progressed until they became identifiable patterns. My exhaustion grew; my unhappiness increased. Over time, I found myself getting upset and annoyed in his presence. I could feel my blood pressure rise when he walked into the room. 

At first I asked myself what it was I could do to change things. To make them better. I asked myself if I was the problem. 

Things were allowed to get to this point because it's not always obvious what the source of the problem is. 

I typed this all out and posted it because it was therapeutic on some level. I also needed feedback from others to make sure I wasn't crazy. I needed to make sure none of this was normal. (Now I know a few of you will jump on that statement and tell me I should KNOW none of it is normal. It's hard to untangle feelings from logic from memories from manipulation. Having to pick it all apart can be confusing.)

I \*did\* break up with him, after bringing up these issues multiple times. And of course, he claimed he only had good intentions. I was misinterpreting everything. 

As a quick UPDATE to the situation:

I broke up with him a few days ago. Since then, he's been avoiding being home. He only comes home at night to go to sleep. He has not harassed me for sex for the past two nights. He and I had a ""conversation"" last night, at his insistence. Apparently, he is doordashing for extra money (as of yesterday) and believes this is all just a big misunderstanding. A hiccup in our relationship. He also believes that there is ""someone else,"" that I dumped him because I'm interested in another man/talking to another man. This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not sure if it's getting through to him that I'm unhappy because of our relationship, not because I want to run off with someone else. It seems easier for him to blame some nameless, faceless ""other man,"" rather than take responsibility. 

Again, thank you everyone who has read and commented on this post.

My boyfriend moved into my house a little over a year ago (previously, we had a great relationship). Since then I've grown to absolutely hate him. I feel on edge, stressed out, agitated, ready to retreat, angry, and uncomfortable whenever I see him or when I'm in the same room as him.

I have spent the past few months trying to figure out why. Initially I blamed myself (maybe I've suddenly become a miserable and crotchety person?), but I believe I have a multitude of reasons for feeling the way I feel.

Here, in no particular order, are the reasons I hate my boyfriend:

Reason # 1

Up until only the past month or so, but only after I repeatedly had to lose my everloving shit on him to finally get him to listen and acknowledge my discomfort, he would constantly (4-7x/week for about a year) nag, beg, coerce, guilt and shame me for sex. Every.Single.Night...as soon as I would go to the bedroom at night to go to bed, he would immediately start grabbing and ripping my clothes off, while demanding sex. He would aggressively paw at me in the most unappealing way imaginable. (And the thing is, I love sex. If my body doesn't feel completely destroyed from a long, work-filled day, I usually want to have sex.) And I would recoil because oftentimes the yanking and grabbing and tearing my clothes off was really uncomfortable, and in a few cases, painful. In fact, he pulled something in my back from grabbing me by the shoulders and yanking me around while trying to forcefully take my clothes off. It took months to heal.

So when I would cringe and try to physically distance myself from him (because I would feel overwhelmed and bombarded), he would immediately begin with the nagging. ""Oh, so I guess we're not fucking tonight? Why don't you want to fuck me? Why? Tell me why? Why don't you want to have sex?"" At this point I would be so turned off, I would decide (even if I originally wanted to have sex) that I would prefer to engage in any activity BUT sex with him. So I would tell him ""no, I guess we're not having sex tonight."" Then he'd ask ""why?"" ""Why? Why? Why? Why?"" I would tell him I simply wasn't in the mood (which was true, because I'd lose the desire to have sex after being manhandled and then asked in a weird, almost accusatory, nagging way if we weren't fucking.)

Then more ""why's"" would follow. Then he'd keep going. Nagging. Begging. Telling me if I didn't fuck him, his entire next day would be ruined. He'd tell me he didn't believe I wasn't in the mood, and would demand to know the ""real"" reason why. He'd accuse me of wanting other men. Etc., etc. THIS would happen during the majority of nights out of a week. I would oftentimes just give him what he wanted, just so I could get some peace and quiet. If I didn't give him what he wanted, the nagging and harassing would go on for HOURS. I would look at my phone occasionally. 11pm. 12am. 1am. And every time I would feel devastated, knowing I had to be up early in the morning, and knowing that I would feel like garbage due to being kept up so late, all because he demanded to know WHY I wouldn't have sex with him.

On a few occasions, he would throw temper tantrums and stomp around and tell me he was leaving the house.

What was once a love for sex (on my end; always loved it), became having sex just to get him to leave me alone and let me finally sleep at night.

I've never in my life experienced this sort of behavior surrounding sex, and I've never in my life been so turned off by someone. Over time, I grew to resent him, mainly because he ruined the joy I always found in having sex with a partner, and also because my sleep and restfulness had suddenly taken a nosedive. My days became more exhausting, more unbearable, more tiring (and I'm an extremely busy person, with a mountain of responsibilities; I cannot afford to not get proper rest).

After a few months of this, I had started to feel stressed out before bedtime. I would hesitate to go up to the bedroom to go to sleep, because he would LITERALLY sit next to me on the couch and WAIT for me to begin walking upstairs so that he could run up and follow me and start his bullshit with the demanding and nagging for sex. It became a conundrum for me: I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed, so I want to go to bed, but I also know if I go up to bed, I won't be getting any sleep.

&#x200B;

Reason # 2

When he moved in, I realized that the rent he was paying at his old place was half the amount I pay at my place. And I didn't want to break him financially, so the agreement was for him to pay what comes out to 1/3 of the rent here. And that's perfectly fine by me.

That being said........

Only up until this past month, he has not bought any groceries for the house BUT he eats an insane amount of food. Oftentimes, while he's drunk/drinking, he gets the booze munchies and rips through the cabinets and refrigerator. A lot of times I would come downstairs in the morning, begin making coffee, etc., and find a bunch of empty food containers, packages, bags, boxes, etc. of brand new stuff I had just bought that was meant to last at least for the week (until my next shopping trip), but was now gone.

What's worse is that at no point did he ever think in his head ""wow, I just ate all of (insert food item), maybe I should go to the store and pick some more up so that my partner can have some."" No. Not at all. Never. The first time I brought up my frustration with the matter (in the very beginning), he was like ""oh, you told me I could help myself to whatever I wanted to eat? So what's the problem?""

I was like...""yeah, but I assumed you would help yourself while keeping me in mind. Like I buy this stuff because I also want to eat it. I don't think someone should have to tell you to have some consideration and leave some for me?""

He acted like he had no clue he wasn't supposed to just eat everything all the time and contribute nothing to the weekly groceries or replace anything. Now, whenever I (very politely, mind you) ask him to leave some food for me (usually when I see him drunkenly rip open a package and begin inhaling the items within), he gets defensive, as if I'm being mean. I just want to eat some of the stuff I buy for the house.

Additionally, he doesn't offer to help pay oil, electric, or anything else. I've brought this up - how it doesn't feel like a partnership because he doesn't even ask if I need help paying utilities. He reminded me that the agreement was the amount he's currently paying towards rent (which by the way amounts to $400/month. He's paying $100 a week to live in a house, eat for free, all utilities included).

&#x200B;

Reason # 3

I guess this goes along with Reason # 2, but he always complains that he is broke. He doesn't make enough money. He has no money. He complains about money constantly. So when we go out, I always feel bad, because it seems like he somehow mentions how broke he is conveniently before we go out to dinner or do things together. So I feel almost obligated to pay. I feel guilty making my ""broke"" boyfriend pay for anything. But I know that's on me. That's a decision I'm making.

What pisses me off, is that in spite of how ""broke"" he is (he will often not have the money to pay his part of rent; he'll pay it late, or break it up into multiple payments throughout the month), he buys alcohol every night (with the exception of a random night here and there), go out to drink, AND for a while there, he was getting Amazon packages multiple times per week. He could afford to order a bunch of stuff for himself every week. But he can't ask me if I need help paying the electric bill.

&#x200B;

Reason # 4

He's clingy and....I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to describe reason # 4, but....he's always up my ass. If I get up to move from one room to the next, or if we're sitting next to each other on the couch and I get up to go upstairs, he demands to know where I'm going and what I'm doing and then proceeds to ask ""why, why, why."" He does so in a very accusatory tone. There's this unsettling sound of urgency in his voice. All I'm doing is going upstairs to get something from the bathroom? Like no matter what I do or where I go in the house, he has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going and for what reason. I feel like I can't do anything without giving an explanation and it's exhausting.

I don't typically go out anywhere (besides work and to shop for groceries and household essentials), but the few times I've begun to leave the house (while of course telling him I had to run out really quick), without giving him a full-blown explanation of where I'm going and for what, he's acted like I was going out to...I don't know what....go to an orgy? The one time, I had to run to Target, and he demanded to know for what, wanted to know what was on my list. I was so exhausted from being followed around and harangued, I snapped at him...because who has time to tell someone their entire shopping list?

BUT THEN, he goes out and I don't bother him about it. I don't demand to know details, who, where, why. He actually goes out-out. Like to bars and to hang out with friends. I don't try to stop him. I don't ask him what he's doing. I don't bother him via text while he's out.

I typically use the nights where he's out as an opportunity to go to bed early, and without being harassed. And surprise, surprise...when he comes stumbling through the door late at night, he ALWAYS shakes me awake and demands sex. Sometimes he wakes me up and accuses me of talking to other men while he was away, and it turns into this big thing and I don't get that extra sleep I had so badly needed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are actually some more major reasons, but I'm now realizing how long this post is.

I told him I no longer wanted to be with him. I don't know how that's going to go, because he lives here now, and I know he can't afford to move out. Of course, he's upset. He tells me everything he does comes from a good place. He has good intentions. With the sex, he says it's not as bad as I make it out to be, or that it's not as often as I claim it is. That's not true. I know how often and how bad it's been. Perhaps the fact that he drinks skews his memory? He claims he only asks me a million questions because he's ""trying to start a conversation."" He only follows me around ""because he loves being around me."" In his mind, he's being a saint. And I'm just misunderstanding him.

So of course, I keep going back and forth. Do I dump him? Stay with him? Am I the bad guy?

I've really been thinking about this. I haven't seen him all day, as he seems to be avoiding me and avoiding being at the house (for the last two days.) I feel more calm and peaceful than I have in over a year.

I have to listen to the way I feel around him, which is straight up trash.

I need to get this off my chest and the off my chest sub deleted it,"When I was about 16, I went on about 2 dates with a guy I went to school with. He was 17, I think. That was it. Just a few dates! We were not the same religion, and he did not respect mine, so I decided not to date him any further. We never had sex or did anything more than make out a little bit. We stayed friendly, but didn't keep in touch after he graduated. That was more than 30 years ago. 

A few years after high school, someone knocked on my door very late at night. It was a cop. The cop asked me if I went to X high school, and then if I knew Few Dates Guy. I said that I did. The cop told me that he was Few Dates Guy's brother and that Few Dates Guy had asked him to look me up and *ask me to call him.* 

At the time I thought it was weird and creepy but also kind of funny. But I didn't think a lot of it. I was young and had pretty poor boundaries. So I thought we were friends. I thought it was just dumb teenage stuff.

But here we are, 30 years after high school, and every couple of years, he still tries to get in touch with me. Back when I had a landline, he would somehow always get my landline number (maybe through his brother.) The last time I actually talked to him was 15-ish years ago. On one of those phone calls he brought up a teacher at our school, and I told him about how after graduation, that teacher tried to S A me. HE CRACKED A FUCKING JOKE ABOUT IT. So I decided to never answer his calls again. A few years later I disconnected my landline and have had only a cell ever since then. 

So now he finds me on social media. Every couple of years he makes a new FB account and messages me. It's always something about how amazing and beautiful I am, how much I enriched his life, and how he loves to see photos of me, wants to know how I am doing, etc. I always ignore the messages. I don't even block him because I don't want him to know that I even saw them. I think any reaction would just encourage him and I don't want him sending his fucking cop brother to my house again. 

A few days ago he made a new account and sent me one of his rambling love messages. I looked at the account. This motherfucker has a wife and two children. 

And I really do just need to get this off my chest. I don't know why this man keeps messaging me. I know it's not about me at all, it's about him and something wrong with him, but, why does he message ME? I can't really talk to people I know about it, because it's so weird. So I am posting it here. ",1733299176.0,Slight_Citron_7064,TwoXChromosomes
"A 6-week abortion ban, but a 7-week first ultrasound policy.","In Georgia. I’m currently very early into a wanted pregnancy but like anyone, am worrying about the caffeine I had a few weeks ago, or the fact that I didn’t take folic acid leading up to the pregnancy test. I want to see whether my lil embryo is developing correctly, but nowhere around me will see me for an ultrasound before 7 weeks, and even then the nurse said they wouldn’t be able to detect congenital defects or deformities since the embryo would be so little. I hate the 6-week abortion ban, but I figured I was being proactive and would be able to terminate if something was horribly wrong - like the neural tube didn’t close or the fetus wasn’t viable or something. The nurse I spoke to told me that a fetus is considered “viable” if there is a heartbeat (which, shockingly, happens around 6 weeks). When I said “so *anything* could be wrong but as long as it’s got a heartbeat it’s considered viable?” She said YES, y’all! FUCK that. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re proactive. It doesn’t matter if you request earlier tests. They didn’t make an abortion ban to keep fetuses safe. They made the 6-week ban in order to trap us. They literally just want to force us to have babies, which may or may not be compatible with life, at any cost. I am so frustrated and I’m hoping SO much that everything is fine (and it probably will be!) but I’m just mad.

EDIT: YES!! The ever-anticipated Reddit Cares report came through! I won the bet, and now my husband owes me a nice dinner and a foot rub. Thanks, pathetic redditor - you’ve made me very giddy this morning. Perhaps ditching caffeine will be easier if I simply replace my morning cuppa with a nice tall glass of bitter men’s tears?

Also, thank you so much to everyone who has helped educate me, reassure me, and contribute meaningfully to the discussion. For those asserting: “just move” or “sorry you live in a fascist state.” Well 1) have we already forgotten than GA went blue for Biden? I’ve lived in Georgia a long time and I’ve seen it’s politics changing recently. I’m proud to be part of that change, and perhaps it’s naiive but I truly believe my party’s work here is not done yet. 2) Shortly after we saw this very encouraging swing toward the left, we had the opportunity to buy a home, which makes more sense financially than renting. We were very fortunate that everything fell into place. We are now financially tied to Georgia for at least a few more years. Literally days after we made it official, the Supreme Court documents leaked. I’m not going to apologize for not having preternatural visions of this horrible event, and if in your mind I “deserve whatever’s coming” because of my inability to move, or that I’m stupid for living in the south where we can afford to live, then perhaps you should take a look in the mirror and work on *gestures at all of you* that.",1684422629.0,murraybee,TwoXChromosomes
"For those of your considering leaving the US, just do it.","I grew up in the US and moved to Norway at 21. It opened my eyes to how balanced life could be, and what a society is like when equality is taken seriously. 

One of the first things that struck me was  no ogling.. I could walk around without unwanted stares or comments that used to happen to me daily in America. Men are much more professional at work, I am no longer constantly questioning their motives.

University here is free, and there are a better mix of women in STEM fields compared to many other countries. For example, there are more female physicians in Norway than male physicians. 

Work life balance is deeply valued. We have a 37.5 hour work week, and flexible working is the norm. If you are having a baby you and your partner can choose between 49 weeks of maternity leave (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 100% pay or 59 weeks (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 80% pay. Fathers have to take a minimum of 15 weeks of paternity leave. The same benefits apply for adoption and same sex couples. You get extra paid time for multiples as well. Everyone gets 5 weeks paid vacation, basically unlimited paid sick leave and child care days for when your kids are sick. 

Healthcare is basically free. You pay a small copay (around $30) for a doctors visit. If you use more than around $300 on prescriptions and visits then you get something called blue prescription that means you don’t have to pay for anything anymore. Baby related care, checkups and prenatal care is 100% free. If I’m not mistaken Norway also has the lowest maternal death rates in the world. Kids healthcare is completely free. 

When I gave birth to my son I did not see a single man at the hospital besides my partner. It was the most amazing and supportive birthing environment. When I had a missed miscarriage and needed medicine to help my body start clearing it out, I was again surrounded by supportive all female medical staff, no judgement, no rules stopping me from receiving lifesaving care. 

The vast majority of men here are raised to contribute equally, from childcare to cleaning and cooking. It is expected to split these duties equally. Toxic masculinity isn’t really a thing here. 

Norway has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. There has been one school shooting here (no casualties) and one bad terrorist attack (22nd July). There have been 2000+ school shootings in the US since 1970. 

Is it perfect here? No. But in my opinion it’s a thousand times better than the US (and like 30 years ahead rights wise). 

My grandparents were holocaust survivors who went to the US for a better life. I love the US and it breaks my heart to see it deteriorating. I always planned to move back but now I don’t feel like there is anything to go back to. I could never give up the freedom I have here.

If you have the chance to get out, do it! There are so many better places to live. Places where women are seen as equals  not incubators. Places where children’s live are worth more than someone’s hobby.

EDIT: a lot of people mentioned that I must have been rich to be able to move to Europe or come from a wealthy family. Lol ya’ll I wish but no. Grandparents came here as refugees with no money and worked factory jobs after coming to US. My mom worked sorting packages and my dad was a house painter. We were 3 kids and broke. I worked 30-40 hours a week the whole time I was in college, had student loans etc. 

If someone is sponsoring you in Norway (for example if you get married), the minimum income they need to have is around 30,000 dollars a year to bring you over. You can work at McDonald’s and make more than that here. 

It’s not just higher education that you can get a work visa for in Norway, you can also get a visa for being a waiter or working in tourism related industries, and a lot of other seasonal work as well so it is really a lower threshold here than other countries. The immigration system here is considerably simpler than other countries, and very modern. 

I mentioned in the comments that I was extremely lucky to get the opportunity to move and know that not everyone will have the same opportunity. I didn’t formulate what I was trying to say very well in my original post but I almost didn’t move when I had the chance, and my life would have been completely different if I hadn’t. I just wanted to encourage those people who might have the chance or could get there to try. I’m not saying the process is as easy as “just do it”. It takes time, work and money. I needed around $1200 for visa and flights to get to Norway. 

I love the US and grew up in a family that talked about the American dream, but it was never a reality for us. My family still struggles and some of them refuse to believe that things could be better in Norway than the US.",1653500457.0,enbeam,TwoXChromosomes
Why do men think that “everything I do is for you!” When everything is just working a full-time job like everyone else?,"I am so frustrated by toxic masculinity ruining my marriage.

This notion ""everything I do is for you"" completely wrecked our relationship. Firstly, because it wasn't true, and secondly, if I did ask for something, then it was just me being ungrateful.

I cooked, I cleaned, I did the laundry, I took care of the dogs, I worked, I went to school, I handled the finances. 

All I wanted was the occasional date night. But how dare I? Couldn't I see that everything he does was for me? How could I be so selfish as to want to hold hands and go on walks?!

How dare I try to plan a romantic weekend getaway. Couldnt I see that his weekly hunting trips with his friends were so much more important? Shouldn't I be grateful to have a man who provides?!

I made my date leave after 20 minutes,"A guy that I’ve had two dates with just left my house and I’m riled up. 

We met on a dating app and his profile said “moderate” for political beliefs. That should have been my first red flag. On our first date, he mentioned that another first date had gone badly because of politics. That should have been my second red flag. On our second date, he complained that some college students he instructed were too confusing/annoying with their complaints of “not being heard.” Third red flag. 

So he came over tonight just to chill. And he brought up the Try Guys and all the drama today. And then started saying how he liked their content but they got too political. I asked, where do you lie in politics? He said moderate leaning right. He voted for Trump and has always voted republican. He started spouting off some conspiracy theories about how maybe the election was rigged and that we’re finding out now some things were true. Sigh. 

I asked about his opinions on abortions rights. It’s important to me that my life and the lives of women in this country are valued. He said that he supports the right for the life of the mother, rape and incest. But how do you support it if you only vote for republicans? Well, he just didn’t approve of democrats other policies like economic policies. So you value economic policies over women’s lives? Apparently so. 

When he left, he actually looked sad. Said it was nice getting to know me. I’m not sad at all. I would rather me happy and single then spent my life with someone who values economic policies over my life. 

End rant. 

Sorry for the word vomit.

Edit: woah guys. After a 12 hour work day, I did not expect this to get so much attention. 

To address a few common questions/comments:

1) This little anecdote was part of a whole conversation. 20 minutes may not seem long but it was long enough to hear several concerning statements outside of his abortion opinions. I didn’t jump to any conclusions, he led me down the rabbit hole. He also claims to be atheist so I’m not sure how he got so sucked into Trumpism. 

2) Speaking of abortion rights, I do not agree with his stance. I believe in unrestricted access to abortion for many reasons. I highly encourage to watch this video by Mama Doctor Jones who gives a thorough review on why banning or restricting abortions is not only unethical but has lasting impact on the woman, her future, her children, and her community.[Doctor Explains Roe V Wade](https://youtu.be/rHrxSUgLvvA)

3) For those saying I was ruining relationships with politics or bringing politics where it doesn’t need to be, screw you. It must be nice to live in a world where actual government policies don’t affect you. I work in healthcare and government needs to stay out of my job. What happens with someone’s body is their and only their decision.

So yeah, I’m going to keep putting good vibes out into the world and I’m still optimistic that I will find someone who gets me.",1664329350.0,mastermobilizer,TwoXChromosomes
Conservative Christian women in red states are rising up to defend IVF,"Paywall so article

Last Saturday, after putting her two toddlers to bed in central North Carolina, Hannah Nelson spotted a disturbing post on her Instagram feed: “The Alabama ruling and a Christian reflection on IVF.”
“Being pro-life doesn't mean 'having babies by any means necessary,'” a Christian influencer wrote about the Alabama Supreme Court's recent ruling that frozen embryos are children – a ruling that invokes God IVF treatment in the state quickly turned on its head. sent many women there and elsewhere into panic mode, prompting lawmakers to scramble to respond.
Nelson, who conceived her son through IVF, is not typically political online. Her Instagram profile says “Jesus follower. Wife. Mother. Optimist. School counselor.” But this post from Allie Beth Stuckey, who has more than half a million followers, shocked and saddened her, and she felt compelled to hit back.
“There is an ethical and Christian way to do IVF,” she wrote. “I wonder why you are against this way of starting a family.”
Across red state America, other conservative Christian women have shown similar reactions since the court's Feb. 16 ruling. Like Nelson, they typically post online about faith and family. In the last two weeks, however, they have become outspoken, even angry, supporters. They have denounced the Alabama ruling on their social media pages and are determined to defend both their values and in vitro fertilization. Her comments often appeared amid photos of the babies made possible through IVF.

Nelson, 30, resorted to the procedure after struggling with endometriosis for years. Her Instagram feed includes photos of her son's embryo and then three-year-old Brent as a baby. (His onesie announced “We prayed for this child.”) She was able to conceive naturally with her second child, but she and her husband still have four frozen embryos that she would like to use one day.
“I never thought [IVF] was so polarizing. There are moms who I really believe are meant to be moms who can't make it without IVF,” said Nelson, a school counselor. She believes the process “can be used for the glory of God” – and that “it is best for the government to stay away from it.”
In Pensacola, Florida, Emily Ley felt “compelled” to speak out — not just because she and her husband have friends across the border in Alabama whose IVF treatment was interrupted, but because they worry about the impact on others make.
“It’s only a matter of time before it happens in other states. It just scares me,” she said.
The mother of three, who owns her own business, usually posts online about organizing her home to her 235,000 Instagram followers. She considers herself to be financially conservative yet socially liberal and usually stays away from political issues. Not now.
“The Alabama Supreme Court's decision regarding IVF has brought me to tears no less than ten times in the last twenty-four hours,” Ley, 41, explained online. She shared how she conceived her 9-year-old twins through IVF to illustrate how the problem can also affect the entire family. “Restricting access to reproductive care is the opposite of progress,” she wrote. “Speak loudly with your voice. Speak out.”
Measures to grant “personal rights” to unborn babies – the crucial detail at the heart of the Alabama ruling was the declaration that frozen embryos are children – have been proposed in more than a dozen states this year. Alabama is among several states that have already passed such laws.
The outcome of the lawsuit left many lawmakers in Montgomery in hot water, and this week they responded with action to ensure IVF will continue to be available there. At a House committee hearing, the emotional nature of the issue was made clear when a Huntsville restaurateur named LeeLee Ray testified that she and her husband have gone through everything they've been through to have a child.
Ray, who describes herself on Instagram as a “wife, IVF and surrogacy advocate, cooking enthusiast, follower of Christ,” shared how the couple had spent $100,000 on IVF over the past six years. A surrogate they recently offered in Colorado cost $260,000 more, but suddenly they couldn't ship her embryos from Alabama.
“We need to do something quickly to get our treatments started again,” Ray pleaded with the committee.
After sometimes heated debates, two bills passed the House of Representatives and the Senate with almost unanimous approval on Thursday. Both would protect both providers and patients from criminal and civil liability if embryos they create are subsequently damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kay Ivey (R) is expected to sign the version that lands on her desk.
But in an extremely political year in which reproductive health is a key concern for many women, the issue is unlikely to subside.
In Nebraska, a 34-year-old nurse whose baby was born through IVF also saw Stuckey's post. She was “horrified” at how insensitive it seemed.
“Show love, grace and compassion to others instead of judgment,” Sara wrote back online. “I would encourage you to not only educate yourself, but to really put yourself in the shoes of a fertility patient. This is not a path one takes voluntarily and it involves great emotional struggle and stress.”
Like Nelson, the nurse was attacked by commenters on the site who said neither she nor IVF is a Christian. Because of that reaction, she asked to be identified only by her first name. Stuckey, an author who also hosts a Bible podcast called “Relatable,” did not respond to a request for comment.
“You attacked my faith. It disturbed me to my core,” said Sara, a Southern Baptist who identifies as pro-life. “Because I had never seen it before [IVF] as wrong, as anything but beautiful and bringing a different life into the world. … In fact, many friends have prayed for me, encouraged me and helped me along the way.”
As a Christian and as a nurse, she added, “There are so many technologies created by man that continue to help people. I consider them a gift from God.”
Some women's biggest fear is that the most conservative states may now consider restrictions on IVF.
“This latest ruling will make future infertility journeys so complicated for many,” said Kylie Hendrick. 27, wrote on Instagram from her home in Killeen, Texas, where the teacher has been undergoing infertility treatment for eight months. “I'm really worried about what impact it will have on other states with similar views.”
Her post sparked comments about when life begins, and Hendrick eventually removed it. “I had a lot of people coming from both sides and I just didn't want to argue with people,” she said.
Hendrick has polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis. Her husband suffers from male infertility. Guided by her faith — she was raised Catholic and is now a nondenominational Christian — they plan to begin artificial insemination after he returns to Fort Hood in June from his final Army deployment.
Her family is divided over the verdict in Alabama, even though the in vitro procedure is key to the couple's hopes.
“I had family members saying it was a blessing that this came out because these lives were being protected and not thrown away,” Hendrick said. “Other members of my family said that it was worrying for us to know that we were suffering from infertility.”
She fears Texas may restrict IVF. She watched Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tell CNN last week that leaders plan to wade into the IVF debate and “want to make sure as a state that we are promoting life.”
“I’ve been looking at out-of-state clinics when it comes up,” she said.
To her dismay, the military clinics she called told her she would likely have to wait a year.
A friend of Hendrick's in Houston, Lindsey White, is a graduate of the University of Alabama, an evangelical, pro-life Christian and a strong critic of the Alabama Supreme Court's decision. She finds it surprising and extreme and criticized it on Instagram.
“I just wish there was more compassion for the religious right,” White, 33, said this week. “They punish families who are trying to start a family. That’s crazy to me.”",1709324454.0,mydaycake,TwoXChromosomes
Why I stopped asking men on dates,"I've probably seen 10 different conversations on Reddit this week trying to encourage women to ask men out. It always upsets me a bit because I used to be a woman who enjoyed asking men out, and over time it left me feeling creepy, manly, ugly, and kind of stupid. 

I've asked out a friend where I was *sure* there was chemistry. He laughed in my face and said he'd think on it and call me back. Years passed and he never did me the courtesy of rejecting me. It became a running joke to our mutual friends and was embarrassing. 

Another time the guy I asked out had his friend tell me no for him. The friend said it was kind of weird to ask a man on a date, and if a man wasn't asking me out then I should know all I need to know. 

The last one I'll share, the man was really offput that I had asked him out. He thought that I was, like, *in love* with him and avoided me like the plague after that. He told mutual friends that he can't handle how much I like him. I just asked him if he'd be interested in going on a date sometime, lol.

Anyway, I no longer take the advice to be comfortable approaching men, because apparently I'm a little *too* comfortable. I do, however, make it clear that I want to he asked out, and I try to be clear when I'd like someone to ask me out. 

I'd love to hear how its gone for other woman who have asked men out. Successful or unsuccessful stories are welcome.

Ending my 6 year relationship this evening,"I am young, and we have been together sinc I was in my teens. We have matured into adults together and are navigating adulthood, jobs, and family stress together. Earlier this year I was even ready for marriage; we were going to move together out our current rental house and find somewhere new and exciting. He is a good person, and we are both flawed. I spent a lot of time this year transforming myself mentally and I have a clear vision of who I am and what I deserve. 

He is a good person but this relationship is very easy for him and very hard for me. It feels like I think for us both and put the effort in for both of us in order to get him to do things I want to do. We do not have a lot of interests in common and that feels isolating. 

I got a dog in May and finally had someone to go on walks with me and sit at the park with. I loved my dog immensely. He got jealous of the dog. I do not have my dog anymore and nothing has felt the same. He doesn't ask me how I'm doing because he doesn't want to know.

With the help of my amazing support system, I understand that even though he is not a bad person, it is ok for me to want better for myself. I was going to wait until next week but when I woke up this morning, everything in my body said to leave, so I packed. My car is filled with boxes and my cat and I will depart in the morning. He works until this evening so I am sorting my thoughts and just being with my house that I love so much. It's a log cabin and cool as fuck. I will really miss this house.

I am scared of feeling lonely, scared of the unknowns, and scared of missing him. I am also really excited to learn more about myself, spend some overdue time with family, and travel. He doesn't like people so we never traveled places I am interested in. Never considered cities where I would like to live. I am really looking forward to thinking about myself.

I don't know who will read this but I needed to see these words outside of my brain. I am leaving. 


Edit: thank you so much everyone who took time to leave a comment. Your encouraging words really got me through the afternoon while I was waiting for him to get home. 

We talked when he got home from work and I kept things short and sweet. I asked if he had anything he wanted to share and he said no, he knows why we are breaking up and he can't think of anything. It was a relief he didn't try to fight back and I respect him for that. I can't say I feel on top of the world but I feel empowered and ready to explore what is next.",1726340212.0,boollin,TwoXChromosomes
My husband wants me to give up starting my business to have a baby.,"We already have an 8 year old that I am the the only one responsible for when it comes to daily care. Never mind that I’m totally nuts and having a baby would put me in the ground. I mean, I nearly took my own life after having this one. Never mind that my husband used to get irritated with our son when he was little so I had to take care of everything. Never mind that he can’t even properly brush his teeth. 

Then, as if all of those reasons weren’t enough, he wanted me to be a stay at home wife/mother. Been doing that for 5 years now and he’s caused nothing but issues. Always having problems paying bills, never even able to get me a decent birthday/Christmas gift. 

I have a chance to start my own baking business. I’m really good at it (like really good) and there’s a market for what I am trying to do. He wants me to put it off because “he will take care of the baby” and I can just start it next year. 

All of this is truly insane to me. There’s no chance in hell I’m having another kid. I don’t even like kids. Don’t get me wrong, I love my son. I would sacrifice my life to save his without a shadow of a doubt. I love him in a way so pure that I don’t think I’ll ever feel toward anyone ever again. With that said, I hate being a mother. I am a prisoner in my home. It’s a nice home, but nevertheless a prison. All I do is cook, clean and iron. I can clean for 8 hours straight and most days I do. If you’re wondering how is that possible, I want you to know that it is. Dust and dog hair accumulate EVERYWHERE. Food smell gets into everything especially when it’s all made from scratch. Laundry and ironing is never ending because they change their underwear after farting (no joke). Trying to get my husband to help with cooking or cleaning is an absolute disaster. He purposely f**ks stuff up so I don’t ask again. Last year I begged him to help with the garden and he had a whole panic attack. Ended up doing it myself anyway. I’ve learned many skills in 5 years: laying tile, painting, removing and putting down new silicone, pipe work and all sort of tasks I had no interest in. I feel like I am in hell and finally see my way out after all of these years, only for my husband to drag me back in. 

He was surprised to find out that I despise cooking because “you love to cook and are good at it”. I’m good at many things and being forced to turn my passion into a thankless, penniless job day in, day out, is crap. 

I’m not having another baby.

"2ND UPDATE: Matt Gaetz will be speaking at a high school near me next week. Below is the email that I sent the superintendent. All I have are my vote and my voice, it's past time I start utilizing both."," [Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wkm5v9/matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high_school_near/)

[1st Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wlsl7j/update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/)

I wrote a follow-up email this morning and sent it to the superintendent and copied the school board. I included a link the first post, and let them know that it had gotten almost 3 million views, and the overwhelming majority of the comments agreed with me. I suggested that they take a look at some of your comments and realize that this is a serious issue. Then I asked what the county’s protocol is if a teacher is under investigation for having sex with a student – is that teacher allowed to remain in the classroom? I also asked at what point does the school/county become liable if Gaetz meets his next “girlfriend” at an event like this, and the county did nothing to prevent it? I mentioned that I had not heard from anyone, but that I was aware that Mr. Chambers (the superintendent) had been responding to others, and that the gist of his response seems to be shrugging the whole thing off. I ended with “I don't have a child in the school system, but I am a taxpayer and a voter. I've been in contact with a reporter from Newsweek, and I have no intention of dropping this.” 

A few hours later, I got a call from the superintendent. I’m not gonna lie, this is so far out of my wheelhouse. I was so nervous. I knew I would be posting an update, so I wanted to record the conversation just to make sure I accurately quoted him. I asked if I could record the call, and he said he’d rather not, that he just wanted to have a conversation. I assume it was for the same reason that he’s responding to emails with phone calls in the first place – to not have a record of what he has said. He gave me the same spiel he’s giving everybody else. It’s not his event, he’ll be there, most of the parents will be in attendance, blah blah blah. I let him know that it’s at a school, so ultimately it IS his event. He did agree with that. He started by saying that it’s an investigation and there were no charges or arrests. I asked if they would wait for charges to be filed and an arrest to be made if it were a teacher. Would that teacher still be in the classroom? He said no, they would be put on administrative leave. I asked what the difference was and he paused and said “you would win that argument” but didn’t go any further. I wish I would have pushed him more on that.

He did try to tell me that that he wasn't going to be pushing a political agenda. I shut that down and said that that was not the issue. The issue is putting teenagers in front of a known predator.

I asked about what the school’s liability would be if it turned out Gaetz was guilty and he had been using these events to meet high school girls. He said he didn’t think that would happen, which leads me to believe he doesn’t believe the allegations. When we had discussed the process for what happens when a teacher is suspected of having sex with a student, he had said the sheriff’s office would conduct an investigation. I reminded him that it’s not the school or the county or the sheriff’s office that’s investigating Matt Gaetz, that it’s the federal government, and that it's real and it’s serious. I also pointed out that Gaetz’s cohort has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing, which has been delayed because he’s fully cooperating in the investigation into Gaetz 

He said that the event was an important opportunity for the students. I agreed, and said that getting the chance to get facetime with their congressman is a huge opportunity for students, but that their safety was more important. I suggested that if he wouldn’t cancel, then the least he could do would be to require parents’ attendance. He said that wasn’t something he considered. I’m sure he’s still not considering it, but at least it is hopefully planting ideas in his head that this is ultimately his responsibility, and there ARE options. I also suggested permission slips or waivers. At least make them acknowledge that he’s a creep (allegedly).

The superintendent said that he IS getting a bunch of calls and emails, including a call from the New York Times, so that’s exciting. Hopefully if we just keep it up, they school district will come to their senses. As one commenter said “god, the bar is just so low”. We’re not asking for much, just that you don’t serve up teenage girls to an accused pedophile on a platter.

Anyway, I will say I’m proud of myself for standing my ground and not letting the superintendent shirk responsibility. He kept saying it wasn’t the school’s event, so I kept pointing out that it didn’t matter whose event it was, it’s happening at the school, and he is in charge of the schools. I was relatively articulate and stood my ground, so that felt good.

At this point, I’m in too deep to just drop it. I think I actually told him that too, now that I think about it. So I’m trying to get this all out there as much as I can. All but one of the board members are up for re-election on August 23rd. I haven’t heard from any of them except for one email from one of them that she would follow up, and then nothing. So I sent my post to all their opponents in the election and told them that it might be a good opportunity to blast the incumbent for inaction. I feel like there’s definitely traction, and a tiny possibility that MAYBE we can get something changed.

This has been a really weird couple of days. It’s been incredibly nerve-wracking, but also, it feels incredible! I highly recommend everybody tries getting involved. Everybody’s comments and messages have really been so encouraging so thank you all for that.

The superintendent is getting your calls and emails, so please keep it up, ESPECIALLY if there is anybody in here that lives in Okaloosa County! Academy Night is scheduled for Tuesday, so we have until then to get it canceled. Thanks Reddit!

I saved a girl in the back of my Lyft last night. (tw: coercion),"I went out driving for Lyft late last night, because if I gave 7 more rides I'd get a pretty good bonus and I could use it because I swear to god the last season of Game of Thrones seems way more grounded in reality than US economics lately.

At midnight I get a ping from Lakeview Lounge in Edgewater.  It's one of those dive bars in Denver that opens at 7 AM for drinking, so you can extrapolate the general atmosphere from there.  My screen says I'm picking up Bobby.  Bobby looks like the typical ""dive bar at midnight on a Tuesday"" scuzzbucket.  The curvy goth girl he's got his arm wrapped around radiates bubbly and sweet.  I can already tell she's white girl wasted.

When they get in the car, the vibes are off.  I hate Bobby already.  I know.  I know in the way that all women learn to know.  When you hit your 40's and have 30 years of repeated exposure to dipshits like Bobby, you really definitely know.  The ride is short or I'd consider kicking him out.  I usually don't drive this late because nobody is out in dive bars past 11 PM anymore except the dipshits.  I start watching the girl in my rear view mirror.

I'm driving up Sheridan towards Arvada, and the girl starts giggling and deflecting.  She asks me to put on music and she sings and rolls down the window and pretends she doesn't notice his advances.  She starts saying loudly and repeatedly that she smells bad.  That she doesn't feel good and she can't wait to go to sleep in her own bed.  I can't see everything Bobby is doing, but I know.  I catch her gaze in my rearview and I raise my eyebrow at her.  I see you girl, I'm watching, I will help you if you need it.

A half mile from the end of the ride, the girl looks around and suddenly says ""Where are we going?""  

I fucking knew it.  I am not letting him take her out of my car.  I am not leaving without her.

Bobby tries to smooth things over, saying ""It's all good, we're going to my place.""  The girl protests that he said he'd get her a ride home.  He keeps trying to smooth things over.  She keeps resisting. 

I speak up and put my Do We Have A Problem voice on.  ""Hey, is everything ok? Do we need to change the destination?""

Bobby says everything is fine, they agreed she could chill at his house for a while and then he'd take her home.  

I look for her in the rear view.  ""Is everything ok?"" I say when she looks at me.  I give her the look.  I will help you, I will help you, I will help you.

The girl says nothing, but she gives me the look.  It's the universal, deer in the headlights look that women learn to send to each other, even strangers, when shit is going sideways.  It's the look that says please, please help me get out of this.  It's the one you flash quickly so men don't notice.  It's the Girl Code.

Bobby answers for her that everything is just fine.  Sometimes when men do this I'll snap back ""I wasn't asking you, I was asking her,"" but we're all trapped in a moving vehicle in close proximity.  I do a risk calculation and I let it go.  But I know.  They all recite the same fucking script.

I'm not letting him take her from the car.

The girl giggles again but her eyes are dead.  She says brightly, friendly, ""It's fine.  We'll just drop you off first and then I can head to my house.  We'll make two stops.  I'm not far away.""

I agree, matching the fake cheer.  ""Yeah, don't worry, I'll take you where ever you need to go.""

It starts to dawn on Bobby that he might not pull this off.  That I might not let him take her out of the car.

I'm halfway down the block from his house.  Bobby is working on her and wheedling as fast as he can. She and I keep repeating no worries, I'll just take her home.  I'm slowing down.  This is the dangerous part.  We all know this is the dangerous part.  Bobby is a little weasel, and we're telling him no.  Either Bobby is a coward and will slink off into the night, or violence is about to erupt in the car and we might be dead in a minute.  Interacting with men is Russian Roulette for us.  We never know which one it's going to be.  And we're expected to put on lipstick and heels and smile incessantly while we play.

I'm not sure, but I think he's going to be a coward.  It's obvious the girl is worried he might go off.

I start trying to make a plan for the violence.  I reach into the well of the door hoping the screw driver I threw in there for a gig a few weeks ago is still there.  It's not there.  I took it in the house.  Why did I take it in the house.  Next plan.  Bobby only has about 50 pounds on me and he's drunk.  He's on the passenger side so I'm too far away for him to choke.  I can probably reach his eyes, smash his nose, punch him in the throat.  Thumb goes on the outside of the fist, just like dad taught me when I was little.  My thumb has been hurting a lot lately; it's probably arthritis and I should probably get it looked at.  It's going to be excruciating if I have to punch him.  I'm wearing flip flops so I can't stomp this guy.  Why am I wearing flip flops instead of something that I can maybe use to save my life when I say no to a man.  I'm not letting him take her out of my car.

Bobby tries a new tactic.  He doesn't want to pay for a longer ride.  He vaguely threatens me that her phone is dead, so he just doesn't know how she's going to match me on Lyft to take her home.  I tell him not to worry, I'll end the ride and not charge him for the extra.  And no worries.  I'm just going to drive her.

I turn and look at him when I say that, and though I keep my voice light I think he sees something absolutely fucking feral in my face that decides it for him.  He's a coward.  He's going to slink away.

He looks at the girl one more time and tries to will her to change her mind. She doesn't move.  He slams the door.  I let out a breath.  So does the girl.

It takes me about five minutes to coax her address out of her.  She's almost blacked out now and she keeps trailing off halfway through.  It's only 2 miles away.  I turn the app off and bring google navigation up.  She repeats herself all the way home.  She just got married.  She kept telling Bobby she was married.  He was a creep.  Her phone was dead.  He said he'd get her home.  He was such a creep.  She just got married.  He thought she owed him something.

I try to coach her, pass down the wisdom that gets handed girl to girl. I tell her about coercion and how men use it to wear down women who are nice.  That a lot of times bars have their own lyft and uber accounts and will pay to get stranded drunk people home.  That if a man is being a creep and won't take no for an answer, to turn into the biggest cunt on the planet.  Society teaches us we can't be cunts but I give her permission to be a giant cunt.  

To never get in the car.

I'm not sure the tape in her brain is recording anymore.  She probably won't remember the wisdom in the morning.

She hugs me.  I watch her go inside.  

I wonder if I need to contact Lyft and explain the situation just in case Bobby tries to retaliate and say I was drunk driving or some other nonsense that can get me thrown off the platform.  Then I realize that he tipped me $5.  That's as much as the fare.  I scared him.  It's probably dawned on him that I know where he lives.  There was something feral in my face.

I finish up the rest of my rides, almost all women, some drunk, some heading for the airport for a redeye.  I tell the story so my hands shake less.  We all have these stories.  They hug me.  I watch them go inside.  I get my bonus and go home.

I smoke out the back door, still shaking a little, while my dog goes out.

I saved one.  It's a drop in the bucket while we hunker down for this extinction burst of the patriarchy, but I saved one and we lived.

Two years ago, when it was my turn, nobody was around to save me.

It’s not your job to make babies for the left,"Just a PSA, I’ve been seeing some people talk about how if women join 4B and don’t have babies there won’t be any lefists left and everyone will be right wing 

It’s crazy to me because that argument is *literally viewing women as baby makers for political parties*, the thing we’ve been saying men see us as forever. 

Women are *not* walking 3D printers, we’re humans and we deserve to feel safe and happy in the single life we get. 

Plus your parents political party doesn’t necessarily determine yours, plenty of people have different political opinions to their parents. 

Feminism came into existence because women were done with being treated like second class citizens, not because left wing men of the time wanted women to have rights. 

So let the facists have all the babies they want, eventually their girls will see how they’re being treated and will take their own action. ",1731063070.0,Andrxia,TwoXChromosomes
I no longer want to have sex with my boyfriend because of past sexual encounters with him.,"f21 m25

I've been with my boyfriend for officially 2 years, but we were dating for a whole year before he actually made it official with me. It took him a long time to ask because he wanted to be sure, and wanted it to feel right, didn't want to rush etc. We now have our own apartment together. 

We've had our ups and downs like usual couples, however I've had problems not feeling loved, cared for, appreciated, and we've had countless conversations about this and nothing has changed really - however we had a conversation last night and he's promised to willingly put more effort in. 

He's my best friend, I do love him so much. But I cant stop thinking about past sexual experiences with him and our current sex life. It's making me feel sick because I know it's wrong, I know its not right. But I'm scared I'm being dramatic or sensitive...? 

Before meeting him, I was a virgin. Complete newbie. He knew this after the first time we had sex. 

* we had a big problem where he would give me the cold shoulder if I didn't want to have sex with him. he would be really harsh and distant. this made me feel pressured into having sex more than a handful of times. I would give in so many times, even if I didn't want to. even if it hurt. I would just carry on because it was better than making him upset or angry with me. I spoke to him about this and he was upset that I felt pressured, and said he would make a conscious effort to not be so harsh if I turned him down, however he said it's a guy thing to be sexually frustrated and to need that release, and that it makes him angry if he can't release it. he also believes in not wanking because he said he had a real problem with it in the past. He's gotten better at not being harsh, he's still cranky when I don't want sex, but he's not 'as bad' as he used to be. I still feel pressured sometimes in fear of upsetting him. 

* he used to basically make me carry on if I bled having sex, regardless of if I was in pain or not. Because I gave in once when I was bleeding during sex, when I wanted to stop another time because I was bleeding, he got angry and said 'you carried on last time so what difference does it make'. I've not bled in a while so this hasn't happened recently. But still. 

* he had this fantasy where he desperately wanted to have sex outside. I've never wanted to do this and would never have done it if he didn't bring me outside himself. We were in a hotel with an outdoor area, not a balcony but a shared patio with the room next door. It was NOT very private but it was dark. We were having date night and went back to the hotel a bit tipsy. We started having sex, and he asked if we should go outside. I said ah I don't know about this, got all panicky, but he basically picked me up and continued to have sex with me outside against a wall. I did not want to do this and id previously said this. He said we need to have fun in the bedroom and make things exciting. The idea of this still makes me feel sick. I wish I'd have stopped him. 

* we were on another date night and he wanted to have sex in my car. he guided me to my car and we sat in the back seats, tipsy again. he pulled his pants down ready, being angry I didn't reciprocate. He knew I didn't want to. There was people all around. Yes it was dark, but it didn't make me want to do it either way. He got angry at me because I wouldn't do it.  Because I wouldn't even just 'suck his dick'. I wrecked date night that night because it was a waste of money apparently because we didn't have sex full stop. 

* he used to constantly talk about threesomes, all the time. even sometimes on date nights. I said I would maybe consider it but didn't promise anything because I wasn't comfortable... we ended up creating an account on a swinging website which i REALLY didn't want to do. nothing ever came of it, thank god, but still. he basically called me boring that I would never engage in it, because we need to keep the sex exciting and not boring. he would get angry at me for turning it down, and said I can't turn down something I've never done before. I needed to be more open minded apparently. 

* I've engaged in some things that I really didn't want to and didn't feel comfortable with, but did anyway because I didn't want to annoy him. like being tied completely up with under the bed cables. wearing a black out hood. being blindfolded. 

* I've caught him recording me a few times during sex which just makes me feel sick. Since the last time, he said he will never do it again. And just said he was too horny and it made him do it. I've checked his phone and can't find them thank god. Still makes me feel sick though. 

* he likes it when I'm drunk and encourages me to drink more on date night. this just makes me super aware and like I can't enjoy myself. 

* he used to touch my body all over, fondle my boobs, privates. then get angry when I told him to stop. said I made him feel like a criminal. 

* he used to always say I should join only fans because we would make so much money. he tried to convince me so many times, and would be sad I didn't want to. 

All of these things combined are making me not want to have sex with him anymore. Wow. It felt good to type all of that out and get it off my chest. 

tl;dr basically just getting stuff off my chest to do with sex in my relationship.",1691613875.0,mooooooll,TwoXChromosomes
I finally stood up to my husband,"I’ve been with my husband for 17 years, married for 13.  Our dynamic is that he gets mad and demands something and I give in to keep the peace.  I always try to fix everything and take care of everything and it’s never enough.  Today he angrily demanded that I get rid of our cat because it pees on his drum mat. This cat was his idea to get and we’ve had her for 16 years.  About 12 years ago he wanted to get rid of her and I cried and he dropped it, but I had to take on all of her care.  I scooped her litter box during both pregnancies and such. If I tried to get him to help he would just say to get rid of her.  Anyhow, this morning he said I needed to get rid of her and I said NO.  He said fine he would get rid of her then and I calmly looked him in the eyes and said if he did I would never forgive him.  He seemed shocked.  I told him I put up with a lot of his shit and this was a bridge too far.  So he’s been sulking all day in the guest bedroom and I’ve been going about my normal routine.  I’m really proud of myself for putting my foot down.

Edit: the cat only peed on his mat when she was inadvertently separated from her litter box.  My oldest moved the cat and the litter box into her room for a period of time and then would accidentally shut the door and kitty would be trapped outside the room.  I’ve since moved the box to a more central location so this won’t happen again. The mat was the only somewhat soft spot she had access too since we have tile floors . She has not peed there for a while but he pulled the mat out today to clean it more thoroughly and the old urine stains are what set him off.

Edit 2: My husband is not always a jerk. He loves me, but he does take me for granted. I love him and I make it easy for him to take me for granted. I’ve just finally decided not to play that role anymore. Either he will accept it or he won’t. I’m not afraid of being alone or anything like that. I’d be fine.

17yo daughter already expected to carry emotional load,"My daughter has been dating a boy a year younger than her for three or four months. 

He recently started blowing her off and hanging with his friends instead. He is slow to respond to her texts. He didn’t acknowledge her in the hallways at school today. 

I’ve explained that he’s likely losing interest, but that he is going to leave it to her to do the breaking up. He’s just content to dismiss and hurt her until she does the work of ending things definitively. 

I was reminded about men often stating the stat that women file for divorce more often then men. Of course it’s not that men desire divorce less often—it’s that they leave the relationship maintenance, even at the end, to women. 

I hate that at 17 she’s already being handed this responsibility. I hate that this kid has so little respect for her as to be content making her feel like crap until she is forced to make a decision for both of them. 

I know they are kids,  but this is very real for her and she really likes (liked) this kid. I wish his parents would encourage him to be honest with himself and with her. Instead she’ll do the harder thing and she’ll learn and mature while he starts a pattern he may cling to into adulthood. 

I have four daughters and one son and god help me if he ever shies away from taking responsibility for his own relationships I won’t allow him not to understand how awful it is.",1692633061.0,Impossible_Ad9324,TwoXChromosomes
I’ve genuinely lost attraction to men,"Ever since I hit puberty I was boy crazy. Planned my wedding from the age of 10. I would sigh and dream about every cute boy that caught my eye, which was all of them. I was a horny little mess for sooo many years. 

I’m married now and I should say I love and am attracted to my husband, as it should be, but from the very beginning of our marriage  we explored polyamory together. For a couple of years we were open and while I know this isn’t usually the case for most couples, our relationship thrived. Our communication, boundary setting, trust, sex life together improved massively. 

However I’ve since closed up the relationship because the amount of men out there that are genuinely terrible people is shocking. Men who have absolutely no loyalty or accountability to their partners, going out and trying to cheat. Men who will try to coerce you into sex and get pissy when you say no. Men who are so staggeringly emotionally immature they’d get with a married lady and then be JEALOUS of her husband when she made the situation clear from the get go. 

The men with the lack of sexual discipline get me the most. They’re literally like animals, existing solely off their animal instincts. No dignity, no class. They’ll whip their dick out for literally any woman or thing that looks their way. It seems bizarre for an ex polyamorous person to be complaining about the level of thirst these guys exhibit, but it’s literally revolting. 

It’s completely tainted my entire perception of the gender to the point where sometimes I look at my husband and wonder, “what kind of depraved bullshit are you hiding?”. Those thoughts don’t stick because my husband is genuinely a good man and I lucked out with him. But if I ever end up single again, I think I’m just going to find a way to be content on my own. I got to take a peek at the modern dating world behind the safety net of my marriage and holllyyyyy crap, forget it. These men are sick. 

I see an attractive man now and whereas before my mind would start racing with steamy scenarios, now all I think is “yeah but he probably has something irredeemably wrong with him.” 

I almost miss my innocent and naivety. Can anyone else relate?

Edit: If you’re a man getting mad at me for talking about men and sharing my experiences…. Well they’re my experiences. And clearly a lot of other womens as well. Maybe instead of getting mad at us you can like, I dunno, encourage yourself and other men to be better?  Rather than coming on a WOMANS sub to whine at us for venting our frustrations. God damn it.

Oh no! The women are waking up to our bullshit! Quick, NOT ALL MEN!!!

Edit 2: to the guy who DM’ed me and said that they hope I get stoned by Arabs (because I’m middle eastern), you’re exactly everything that’s wrong with your gender. Thanks for proving my point. Women criticize men for being shitty, men react by threatening violence and wishing death on women. And we’re the emotional irrational ones 🙄 get a grip on something other than your mediocre dicks

Edit 3: I woke up and this post exploded. It’s both really validating and really sad to read to many comments from women who feel the same way and agree with me. Wanna know what’s even more sad though? The dumbass men who are bitching about sexism in the comments and in my DMs. I know it’s hard to think past your mushroom head, but the “sexism” in my post is nothing like the sexism women experience at the hands of men. Men get their feelings hurt, women die. That’s the difference between our sexism. They’re not the same. Also misandry is a direct response to misogyny. If men weren’t so awful and dangerous, women wouldn’t be saying this shit. All you men want to do is silence us as you’ve done for millennia. You can all rightfully get fucked, by most likely your right hand because your personalities are putrid. 

To those comparing me to incels…. Clearly getting laid is not my issue. Your false equivalencies are embarrassing. 

And finally to the men who have been leaving positive comments, I appreciate you. I hope you do your best to improve the state of your gender.

ONE LAST EDIT because I’ve seen You this repeated over and over again: 

“You’ve run into the worst of us because you were practicing polyamory and that filters out all the good men” 

Firstly, yes the lifestyle I partook in definitely attracted assholes. Having said that, it is not my fault that I exposed to these creeps because of my lifestyle. I always went into every encounter with openness and communicated my expectations and needs very clearly. It is not my fault then that these men continually pushed my boundaries. It’s not my fault they lie and cheat on their partners. It’s not my fault they have no sexual discipline. That’s on them, not me. 

Furthermore, the men I met who were actually polyamorous were rarely the problematic ones. It was the regular cishet men who tout monogamy (but then cheat), push their misogynistic beliefs onto us, and can’t take no for an answer. 

If you actually read the comments, the majority of which are from monogamous women, you’ll find that this is a very common experience they have as well. It’s not because I’m polyamorous, it’s because those men are trash. 

One last thing - I only speak of my traumas through my polyamory experience. I haven’t even gotten into the sexual assaults I experienced before marriage, I didn’t get into how my male cousin tried for years to fuck me, I didn’t talk about how I only realized a few years ago that the older man I trusted was actively grooming me when I was a teen and I was too naive to realize. It’s only through the eyes of a grown woman now that I finally see what was happening. Even the “mild” example of how boys in my family would name their cars after girls…. Because women are objects right??

So whiny messages from men about how “wErE nOt RaPiStS aNd CrEepS” ….. enough of you are that’s it’s absolutely not worth it to associate with you. And the more you fight back against that the more you prove my point. Y’all don’t fucking listen even when we tell you the truth to your faces.

Is it unreasonable to be completely opposed to the idea of moving to a red state?,"TLDR: I told my boyfriend I would never want to move to the state his family lives in due to the laws/political climate there. He’s frustrated I’m not being open to it but I consider access to abortion to be a non-negotiable and would prefer to live somewhere more inclusive (especially if we have kids).



Long Version:

My boyfriend (29m) and I (28f) have been together 2 years and recently signed a lease to move in together later this summer.


We currently live in a very blue city in a very blue state. We both lived in a very red state (Missouri) prior to living here and his family is still there. My family is now in a purple state that currently does have access to abortions.


I love living in our current city but when we were talking about potentially having kids down the line we agreed that it probably wouldn’t make financial sense to stay here if we did. 


We could potentially move out to the suburbs but are not sure we’d have a great support system there since most of our friends are tentatively planning to move away when they start their own families and neither of our parents would be close enough to help. 


He mentioned the idea of eventually moving to St. Louis since he has a ton of family there but I reminded him that I felt very strongly about not living in a state where I didn’t have control over my own body. In the past when I’ve mentioned this he’s always agreed that made sense so I thought we were on the same page here. 


I have lived in Missouri before and enjoy being in a blue city infinitely better. I also don’t like the idea of raising children in a place that is restricting access to abortion and books and proposing insane “don’t say gay” and anti trans laws. Even if our potential children end up being straight white boys I’d want them to grow up somewhere where inclusivity is encouraged rather than legislated against.


I said it was a non-negotiable for me to live in a blue (or at worst purple) state and that if he was dead set on moving back to Missouri that was a dealbreaker for me. I had told him before that I didn’t want to move to STL so didn’t think this was an issue.


While I don’t think he’s totally committed to going back to Missouri, he’s frustrated that he’s open to moving where my family is but I’m not open to moving where his is. I understand where that is coming from but I don’t want to pretend to be open to it if I truly don’t want myself or any potential future children to live in a place that doesn’t view everyone as equal.


I know I’m being stubborn here but this seems like a reasonable hill to die on. Am I being totally unreasonable?


Sorry for the novel lol just feel like we need to figure out if we can get on the same page before moving in together in our current city since that’s a big relationship step.",1682397559.0,boxofgoldfish,TwoXChromosomes
Getting up and leaving is my new boundary setting technique. I love it.,"Around Christmas this year I had an awful experience where my husband’s uncle made sexual comments to my 2yo. Nobody else in the room reacted. Luckily I had a visceral reaction and stood up and left with my child. 

This is my new go-to. As soon as any misogyny, transphobia, racism or homophobia appears- I might ask clarifying questions to encourage the bigot to expose themselves, but then-No arguing, no yelling, no convincing anyone of anything. I just say ‘ok that’s enough’ or ‘I can’t continue this conversation’, stand up, grab my kid and leave. 

Its fucking great!

Today my SO of over a year is with the woman he cheated on me with while I am packing up my life with him. It's a hard day and I'm a wreck. I'd be so happy for any encouragement.,"I'm a lurker and don't really deserve the support but I could really use it. My SO hasn't even broke up with me. He says he didn't cheat but is already in a relationship as I've learned from his sister. He has his daughter this weekend and said last night that he would bring her here but he didn't. She is seven and has been just as important to me as he was. I'm 35 without kids of my own. He bought an engagement ring last fall and I was so happy to have my forever family. Now it's all gone. He hasn't talked to me about it. He told me only that he needs to move out of our town and get away from negative influences here. But I found that he has been texting and calling a number in the town he is moving to and I now know they are involved. My name is on the lease and his check for January and February bills bounced. I have been lied to. And there are so many empty promises. The least I was hoping for was to say goodbye to his daughter. She loves me so much! And I love her. Now I'm on my own again. My friends and family have been great help but today everyone has their own thing to do. And I can't stop thinking of him with his new girlfriend celebrating today while I'm here alone. 
If you have any words of support and encouragement I would really appreciate it. 

TLDR Ex cheated, lied, and hasn't let me say goodbye to his daughter.

I am incredibly grateful. Thank you for sharing your experiences and letting me know I'm not alone. Thank you for taking the time to write encouraging words. Making this post has shown me unbelievable support and I am so appreciative. I hope, when I'm able, to write back and give more individual thanks. You are all incredible! Thank you.

The tone-policing on this sub needs to stop,"

This has been happening a lot on this sub that must be addressed. 


Listen, guys, you are absolutely 100% welcome on this sub. Whatever your reason may be, you are well within your right to be here.


Here what's not okay: Tone policing. 


I've been seeing this happen on and off for months on this sub now where an OP will express their point with anger, rage, and/or frustration. Whilst the top rated comments share their similar experiences and agree, a slew of comments from men come in and tell OP they need to relax and dismiss the point OP is making as ""not such a big deal."" While these comments get downvoted to oblivion, there is still enough that pressures the OP to make an edited note on their post stating they were ""just venting and I'm sorry for my anger.""


To the women and enbies: Don't ever apologize for your rage. Anger is not a bad emotion, and you utilize your anger in a healthy way by addressing a societal issue. The ""downside"" here is you're making men uncomfortable, but guess what? Addressing societal issues makes everyone uncomfortable. Embrace your anger. You are doing fine. If you are putting together coherent and understandable sentences that make sense to readers, you are absolutely rational in your anger.


To the guys on here, most specifically those guilty of doing this: I have just one question. Who do you think you are? Genuinely, who do you think you are? Are you here because you believe you are a rational and calm savior to the ""irrational and angry"" women?


Are you here with the intention of educating yourself but too uncomfortable with angry women? Well, listen, I have some bad news for you. We are not going to stop being angry. 


All over the world, our rights and humanity keep being questioned. You are privileged in that you may never be seen as less than for the gender you are. You have no right to tell someone of disenfranchised gender that their anger is coming from an irrational place because you don't know where that rage is coming from and may never know unless you practice some basic empathy for those different from you (and even still, you may still never live through this in your day to day life). 


To the guys who stick around, listen to us, and aren't guilty of doing this: Thank you for meeting the bare minimum. Treat yourself to a cupcake or ice cream or something. Nothing more I really need to say.

I really wish I get some tone-policing comments for this. The hilarious irony will make my day.

(ETA: ""women and enbies"" sounded cool while writing but plz note I am including all trans folks)

ETA 2: This post blew up, and there are quite a few guys who try to empathize with those who do this. To you I say it's not 100% appropriate here, but I encourage you consider joining r/MensLib. It's a fantastic sub for guys like you to uplift each other and hold each other accountable.

Normalizing periods in schools,"So my daughter’s male middle school principal told the whole school (800+ kids) that they can’t bring ANYTHING to school on the last day.  No phones/bags/water bottles/purses.  Nothing.  

She’s a rule follower and was panicking about finding cargo pants so she could hide pads. Of course this male principal didn’t even think twice about this request.  I’m so annoyed that there isn’t perspective taking during such a complicated time in young women’s lives. 

I really encouraged her to take a purse, but she wouldn’t.  I did convince her to keep her cell phone in her pocket—it’s a safety issue for young women now.  

Can we just normalize having periods?  And trust young women to bring what they need with them to feel safe in this world?

"Boyfriend told me that I should’ve changed my shirt, so I ended our 4 yr partnership","Back to back years of verbal and physical abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, and overall contempt for my feelings in any capacity.

I was so convinced I was the problem. So convinced I deserved it all and if I only worked a little harder on myself I would be treated better. It only ever got worse. 

The final straw finally came, he threw a glass of water in my face over something so mundane. He stared at me dripping wet, called me an effing loser, and left to take the dog on a walk. I sat on the porch and cried. My neighbor came outside and saw me soaking wet and asked if I was okay. I said that I was and we briefly spoke but I clearly wasn’t. Deep down I knew I couldn’t take any more.

I decide to give him one last chance to open his eyes to the abuse and commit to a change. To finally sincerely apologize. 
I told him my neighbor saw me soaking wet sitting on the porch in a puddle of tears, and asked him if he realizes how bad that looks from an outsiders perspective. Begged him to see it through another lens, hoping for one last chance to get through to the man I fell in love with. His response?
“You should’ve changed your shirt.”

He has said so much worse, done so much worse, but in that moment, I knew it was over. The final gut punch. 
I finally felt ready to stand up for myself, and the next day I left while he was at the grocery store, and I haven’t looked back. Took my dog, and what mattered to me, and I’m free. Heartbroken but free.

Edit: I am so overwhelmed with the support (and a few creepy messages ?) I have received from this post, truly have been in tears all day. I feel like I’ve received the biggest internet hug of all time!

I hate when a normal guy friend gets horny and weird out of nowhere,"I have a good friend who 98% of the 2 years I've known him has been a complete and total gentleman. He has not flirted, been inappropriate or made me feel uncomfortable... until this week.

He's visiting me from another country and we've had a great time sightseeing and whatnot. Out of nowhere one night he just started getting that look in his eye and I just knew he was feeling horny and I was the closest thing around. We were NOT flirting and I was NOT giving any signals that would encourage anything and as soon as he started acting that way I said good night and went to my room. The next morning he was back to totally normal and respectful.

Then last night, it being his last night, he stated getting emotional about leaving and got really, really close in and I know if I wasn't obviously and visibly uncomfortable or made eye contact with him, he totally would have kissed me. Ugh.

I really don't think he actually has feelings for me, it seems more like he gets emotional and wants to get physical and it just grosses me the fuck out. Like, why ruin a friendship like that? Why act like a totally normal friend for 2 years and then just try something right before you're going to leave with no future date to see each other again?

I'm just feeling major ick and wish it wasn't like this EVERY FREAKING TIME. At least this guy is perceptive and empathetic enough to take a hint and not push things.

EDIT: The 2% of the time he wasn't was when we first met at a bar and he was trying to hook up. We didn't and became just friends soon after that and ever since.

EDIT #2: I know this is a story as old as time and I've mostly given up on straight male friends at this point. It doesn't mean I can't hate it and be disappointed. I do have 1 or 2 guy friends I've managed to be just friends with after overcoming the initial attracting period. And YES, we have a LOT in common that we've talked about over these 2 years, including several common hobbies/interests.

EDIT #3: For everyone saying he is clearly into me: Perhaps, but I can usually tell as I've experienced it so many times before. I'm mid-40s so I'm not naive or inexperienced with men. It's not as though I haven't considered it a possibility, or even a probability he might think of me that way, but he has literally \*never\* talked about anything romantic, sexual or given any indication of interest beyond friendship whatsoever. He also has gone on dates with other people and I've talked about other guys to him, so I have no reason to assume he did. 

As far as I'm concerned, it's on him to bring up any feelings he has if he wants more, it's not on me to do the emotional labor of figuring out/assuming his feelings and bringing it up. I don't think he did that because he doesn't HAVE feelings for me and/or he realizes a relationship is untenable for multiple reasons I didn't mention. Which is why it felt gross. You could argue he didn't because he sensed I wasn't into it, but that was not my read on the situation. If someone has genuine romantic feelings for you, it's consistent, not all business, then suddenly horny, then back to business imo.",1711069955.0,APladyleaningS,TwoXChromosomes
"Satanic Temple opens 'religious' abortion clinic, promotes 'abortion ritual'.","https://www.christianpost.com/news/satanic-temple-opens-religious-abortion-clinic.html

The article says chemical abortions,  but doesn't go into specifics about the drug/chemical.


 from Wikipedia ~ 

The Satanic Temple is a non-theistic organization and new religious movement, founded in 2013 and headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts. 

Established in reaction to the ""intrusion of Christian values on American politics""

The group views Satan neither as a supernatural being, nor a symbol of evil, but instead relies on the literary Satan as a symbol representing ""the eternal rebel"" against arbitrary authority and social norms, or as a metaphor to promote pragmatic skepticism, rational reciprocity, personal autonomy, and curiosity.

https://www.tsthealth.org/resources#medicationabortion

Continuing from Wikipedia ~ 

The organization's mission encourages ""benevolence and empathy"" among all people, using Satanic imagery to promote civil rights, egalitarianism, religious skepticism, social justice, bodily integrity, secularism, 

and the separation of church and state;

 relying on religious satire, theatrical ploys, humor, and legal action in their public campaigns to ""generate attention and prompt people to reevaluate fears and perceptions"",and to ""highlight religious hypocrisy and encroachment on religious freedom.""

The organization participates in political actions such as lobbying efforts, with a focus on exposing Christian privilege when it interferes with personal religious freedom.

It considers marriage a religious sacrament that should be governed under the First Amendment's protection of religious freedom which should prevail over state laws. 

The group views restrictions on abortion, including mandatory waiting periods, as an infringement on the rights of Satanists to practice their religion.",1728992696.0,pjenn001,TwoXChromosomes
I was raped by my HIV-positive cousin and I have been taking PEP.

I was staying in his guest room while laying in the bed reading a book and he came in at night while intoxicated, I could smell the alcohol on him, still coherent enough to tell me some of the most disgusting things I’ve ever heard during it though. He tore my underwear and said that I am enjoying it, that he loves me, and that he loves “being up in my little p*ssy”which is so disturbing. Absolute yuck, I threw up in my mouth. I still feel so gross. He didn’t use a condom and he has been open with his HIV status in my family.

At the hospital, I got an anonymous rape kit without reporting him yet(I am scared to report him and go through everything…He is a powerful lawyer in my state but I still wanted to get it just in case I ever go forward with it) and they told me that I could have flu-like symptoms while taking PEP. I feel like I can’t move due to body pain, the nausea is awful, coughing, and I have horrible headaches. Each day I just hope and hope with tears that the medicine works. I am mentally in so much pain and with how I feel physically right now, living feels unbearable. I could use some encouraging words and/or advice. and do any of you have experience with PEP?

Why Aren’t We Encouraging Women to Fight Back?,"I want to address something I feel is missing from an important conversation. Across the country, we’re seeing pregnant women denied essential healthcare because of abortion bans, putting their lives at risk. At the same time, there’s an alarming rise in sexist and misogynistic rhetoric—not only online but also from politicians. It’s clear that there are forces working to roll back women’s rights in a very real way.

Currently, the political landscape doesn’t look favorable for women’s rights advocates. It feels as if we’re expected to be passive while our rights are eroded—like there's an assumption that we’ll simply accept what’s happening to us.

Given this, I can’t help but wonder: *Why aren’t we encouraging women to fight back?* Is it time to consider new forms of resistance that make it clear we won’t be passive participants in our own victimization?

This isn’t about advocating violence, but I’m frustrated by the expectation that women should always respond “peacefully” while facing such attacks on our autonomy. Are there ways to fight back that make a statement, that disrupt, that demand to be heard?

Recently, I heard something that resonated with me: *“It does not pay to only be an intellectual; somebody's got to be dangerous in this motherfucker.”* This hit home because, while intellect and peaceful protest are crucial, sometimes strength and bold action are just as necessary to confront these injustices head-on.

This one will be brief - the event is still scheduled and Gaetz is still attending. Thanks to you guys though, we are getting national attention! [Newsweek published this article this morning](https://www.newsweek.com/matt-gaetz-sparks-outrage-over-hosting-high-school-event-1734014), and I believe Vanity Fair should be publishing one shortly as well (I'll update the post with that link when it comes out). Thank you so so much to everyone that has participated in this discussion and for all of the many encouraging and helpful messages I have received from all over. I haven't gotten a chance to reply to all of them, but I truly appreciate them. Covid finally caught a hold of me, and I've been laid up since the weekend, but I've read them all.

I keep telling myself that even if this event doesn't get cancelled, this post and the public outcry has brought some much-needed attention to the issue, and hopefully people that were all-in on voting for Gaetz are reconsidering their position.

On a personal note, if you have thought about getting more involved and haven't because you don't feel like it will do any good - do it! It'll feel great!",1660666008.0,TipsyRussell,TwoXChromosomes
"If he can’t feed you, he can’t starve you","I was in a long term relationship with a guy who seemed great at first, then over time because increasingly obsessed with the idea that I didn’t “need” him. Examples:

— had an issue with me making a lot more money than him, even though I always told him it didn’t matter to me. And I supported him to do career and education things to reach his own goals. 

— didn’t want to commit to having a child with me when I told him that was something non negotiable for a life partner, because he didn’t want to be financially on the hook for another child (he had one already); then when I suggested I could use a donor to have a child on my own so he wasn’t responsible, freaked out and said that would mean I wouldn’t “need” him for anything. Meanwhile he’s encouraging me to be a stepmom to HIS child.

—frequently told me it was an issue that I am an independent-minded person, despite my constant compromising in the relationship. 

Surprising no one, we broke up. One of the last things he did to emotionally blackmail me was to say I was unlovable because I would always want something more. And yet I haven’t regretted it for a single moment, because it’s so clear to me now that he’s in a subgroup of men who aren’t happy unless they have complete control of your thoughts, emotions, finances, and relationships. They don’t view a relationship as a partnership among equals. They view you as a resource to exploit for childcare, housework, sex, and blind unquestioning affirmation. 

It scares me to think about the many women out there who are already in or in danger of falling into relationships like this. I heard a quote on a podcast that rang true about why some men are obsessed with creating reliance: “If he can’t feed you, he can’t starve you.”

"I think my husband’s best friend SA’d me while we were drunk, but nobody will tell me the truth","My husband \[25M\] and I \[25F\] have a friend \[25M\], let’s call this friend X. X is the person we hang out with most. He’s our “best friend”.

&#x200B;

**Relevant background:** 

When X is drunk, he hits on me - with plausible deniability. My husband doesn’t usually pick up on social cues, but even he senses it. X is a lot more bold with it when my husband isn’t around, but still does it in a way that he can deny it later.

Examples of bold things: He’s told me I can change out of my bathing suit in front of him, as if it was more convenient than going to the nearby bathroom. He’s suggested we go skinny dipping. He’s done other things, for some reason I can’t remember right now, but I’ve always said no. He also encourages us to drink.

My husband and I have talked about this, and he thinks that X is in love with me. I think X just wants to sleep with me. Regardless, after a particular incident where he asked to touch my leg (to show me some swimming mechanic he was trying to explain while we were in the hot tub), I told X that he’s too comfortable with me and he needs to respect our relationship. X said that he felt it was coming out of nowhere, we’re his best friends, and he would never do anything like that, etc.

My husband gives everyone else the benefit of the doubt. He doesn’t like cutting people off or distancing from people unless they’re absolutely, undeniably, 100% horrible. When I tell him how I feel about people who are horrible to me and that I want to distance myself from them, he says that he isn’t allowed to have friends, and that if I had it my way he would only have one friend left. So he knows how I feel, but I haven’t made him cut X off or anything, and we’ve just continued with the friendship like normal.

&#x200B;

**Now to the particular issue:**

Two months ago, my husband got super drunk while we were hanging out with X and another friend, Y \[24M\], plus X’s friend Z \[26M\]. My husband ended up passing out on the toilet. I remember checking on him and he kept saying he wanted more time. Later, I had a sip of his drink on accident (he poured extra tequila into a canned margarita, and I mistook his can for mine). My memory starts getting blurry around 11:30 (maybe 30 minutes after my husband left for the bathroom), but I don’t remember drinking all that much to where I’d be blacking out. It’s possible, but I’ve been careful not to drink too much around X. Maybe I wasn’t careful that night.

At around midnight we took a group selfie. I don’t actually remember any of this, but I remember the thoughts and feelings I was having in the moment. X put his arm around me for the photo, but his hand was touching my butt. I remember thinking “Hmm, weird, but that couldn’t have been on purpose. Did that even happen?” But I remember thinking about how he did it again, and that meant it definitely happened the first time too. In the photo, I can just barely see the reflection of his arm around me.

That was right before midnight. I don’t remember anything after that. The next day I woke up in his guest room next to my husband, covered in vomit, without a bra. My shoes were off and placed neatly next to each other, and there was a water bottle next to it. We didn’t have a sheet or blankets or anything, just a mattress.

When I showered, I found a massive bruise on my butt. After getting ready to leave and heading downstairs, I found my bra on the floor in the kitchen. 

The next day, I asked Y how I got the bruise and why my bra was in the kitchen. Y said that around 2am I fell on the stairs while trying to go to the bathroom (since my husband was in the upstairs bathroom, I had to go downstairs). Y said that I never made it downstairs. He said he didn’t know why my bra was in the kitchen, but that I probably threw it downstairs?? Which, first of all, is weird, but second of all isn’t physically possible since he said I was just three steps down from the top, and there’s a wall there. He also said they heard me fell, helped me upstairs, and put me to bed afterwards because I was sleepy. He said I was totally fine before that. He told me that X told him to put my husband to bed while X put me to bed, because “\[OP\] already did her turn” (as in, I was the one checking on him previously). Y said that after that, he left.

Then I texted X asking how hard I fell, and he said he didn’t know. I asked X if he knew how my bra got in the kitchen, and he said he honestly had no idea. I told him it was bothering me, and he didn’t respond. 

A week ago, I asked X in person what happened. He still said he had no idea. I told him that I didn’t want to accuse him of anything but that I remember it not being a normal night, and he asked what I meant. I got angry and told him I remembered him touching my butt, and he’s literally doing it in the group photo. He said that he gets touchy when he gets drunk, and he’s sorry if he made me uncomfortable. He again said that he genuinely doesn’t know how my bra got in the kitchen. I asked him if I did anything embarrassing and he said I didn’t, that we were all just watching YouTube. He told me that I was taking shots with them, which I rarely ever do. I asked if I made it to the bathroom, and he said that I might’ve. He said that they put me to bed after I fell. 

I just can’t believe that neither X nor Y would know how my bra got off. It’s unlikely for me to be wandering alone downstairs and taking my bra off. 

My husband said that if X actually did anything, he would cut him off. But he really doesn’t think anything happened. He thinks I just got hot or uncomfortable and took my bra off (but we didn’t hang out in the kitchen!). He still trusts X alone with me. I have felt so depressed about this and my husband has told me to try to distract myself rather than keep thinking about it.

I just need closure, I need an explanation. The fact that we don’t KNOW if anything happened, I just can’t make my husband cut X off with no explicit proof. My husband also wouldn’t be willing to do that without 100% certainty something happened.

I’m really not sure where to go from here. I have a suspicion that he maybe dosed my husband’s drink (my husband keeps passing out when we hang out with him). But it could’ve been that my husband does keep drinking too much (he literally added extra alcohol to his drink).

I have no proof of anything. I feel lost and alone. I’m in desperate need of support. What do you think happened, and what should I do?

**TLDR:** When my husband’s best friend is drunk, he hits on me with plausible deniability. I vaguely remember him touching my butt that night, and nothing after that. Then I woke up in vomit, without a bra. My husband also blacked out, and nobody is telling me anything that actually explains it.",1700851254.0,ThrowRA104848,TwoXChromosomes
I reported a doctor who got my number by accessing my private files and he was fired!,"I took my sister to the emergency last week and the doctor who looked after her was competent and polite. It was a good experience and nothing out of the ordinary happened until a few days later when I got a text from him asking me on a date.

The thing is, I never gave him my number. We didn’t even flirt, in fact our interactions were minimal. I don’t have my number available online anywhere, so the only reasonable explanation is that he looked through my private file in order to get my number. 

I told my friends about it and got mixed opinions. Some of them, mainly the guys, told me to just say no and forget it, and that I shouldn’t over react and report said doctor for merely “shooting his shot”. 

Thankfully, I decided to report him anyway. I made a formal complaint and told my parents about it. Since one of the hospital owners is a family friend, I also forwarded him my report along with a screenshot from the convo.

Well, Ive just been informed that he was fired. Turns out this doctor isn’t a first time offender and is constantly bothering the female staff. Had I chosen to ignore it, he would’ve carry on harassing his patients.

I feel silly for even contemplating the idea of not reporting him. Don’t let your friends gaslight you and speak up every time you feel uncomfortable with something.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards and the encouraging messages!

Even though I knew that this doctor’s actions were ethically and legally wrong, I hesitated to report. Even though there would be no major consequences to my life if I filed a complaint, I hesitated. Even though I had a support system who would’ve believed in me, I hesitated. My heart aches for all the woman who sent me messages asking for advice on how to deal with harassment from coworkers, family friends, clients etc... whatever decision you girls make will have stronger consequences to your daily life than mine did. I hope you find the strength to make your voices heard.",1615414783.0,Successfullawsuit,TwoXChromosomes
Mom is sending pictures of me around,"So idk what I am really posting for, maybe some advice or some validation? I already posted in legal advice and things are just looking bleak for me. I made an OF account a bit ago to help my dad with some bills, and I figured maybe I could get a small amount of extra income. But it turned out I started getting WAY more than I thought and eventually my mother found out. She sent very explicit pictures of me to my dad, my little brother and all his friends, all my dad friends, her friends, professors and the dead at my college, and even posts pictures of me on her FB and Instagram. It is incredibly humiliating and honestly I am pretty comfortable with my body but I never wanted my dad and my brother to see like that. I just dont know what to do anymore

EDIT: To the people asking for my OF. Look normally I would love to show you! But I am not trying to use this as any advertisement and I am not even sure I will keep doing it yet so giving me money right now would just be for pictures. But yeah I advertise on a different account but not this one. I hope you guys understand

UPDATE:Thanks for all the supportive comments guys, I have been in a really dark place these last few days and yall are helping me crawl out. I spoke to my dad about pursuing legal action against my mom, and he seemed against it. He does not want to uproot my little brothers life even though he agrees my mother should be punished. My dad lives in a double wide in the middle of no where while my mother lives in a nice two story house in the city in one of the best districts. I also do not want to hurt my little brother more. I have gotten no calls back after filing the police report so idk what is suppose to really happen there. As for me I will keep doing OF since my dad is kicking me out. I pleaded to stay but he told me he could not see me as his little girl anymore but an attractive woman and it made him uncomfortable. I am pretty heartbroken about that but i respect his choice. I am packing my stuff will hopefully be out by the end of the month or my dad will change his mind idk. I am going to get into therapy and try to really help myself. I feel like I am doing the wrong thing and it makes me feel like such a shitty person but I just really do not want to hurt my brother even more than I already have. I will try to update if anything changes or I get a call back. thanks again  


UPDATE 2: Idk if I should make another post but I spoke with my school about the entire situation and the principal was actually very nice, and understanding of my situation and also encouraged me to press charges, he gave me copies of the emails my mother sent to him which was incredibly awkward knowing what he saw but he was very professional about it. I spoke to my counselor and I am going to start therapy in Oct. My friend also has an empty room in her house that she is willing to rent out to me, so I am actually pretty happy about that. My little brother is upset with me, and not speaking to me right now. I contacted the parents and sadly they were more appalled by me than my mother, and even said I was the one showing their kids pictures of myself. It was just baffling. As for my dad he seems depressed and hardly speaks to me either, almost like he avoids me. Nothing from the police report has come back yet, I am really worried to pester them and make things worse but I am just hoping they contact me and force me to press charges. Overall I am okay so thanks for all the support, I think once I move out and just get away from everything I will start to get over it but as of now it just really hurts.

[UPDATE] I found out that I'm the other woman. I told the wife.,"[Original post from last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xvry6z/i_found_out_that_im_the_other_woman_should_i_tell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

After protecting myself and my identity in what ways I could, I told the wife. I found her number and texted her a brief, factual message that her husband cheated on her, the date we matched on Bumble, how I had no idea he was engaged or married, the fake last name and how he never mentioned her, but did mention other people in his life. I gave her a few screenshots to demonstrate that it went on over a series of months. 

She replied the next day thanking me. She said she was on her way to her parents' house and was planning on filing for divorce as soon as possible. She had been suspicious after testing positive for HPV about a month ago. As I (and you guys) suspected from the house being only in her name, apparently he is completely financially dependent on her and everything he told me about having investments and small businesses is a lie. I also found out that in addition to a fake last name, he gave me a fake phone number too. She cautioned that he may try to retaliate once she gives him the news, and she will message me before she gives him the papers so that I can go to a friend's house for a few days if I feel the need. 

It's been a stressful and emotional past few days. I'm upset that men like this exist. Proud of myself for telling her. Thankful to my friends and to all of you who encouraged me to tell her. Proud of her for leaving him. A little bit scared of what he will do. 

TL;DR I told the wife that her husband cheated on her. She was grateful and is going to file for divorce.",1665625032.0,boombix,TwoXChromosomes
Slapped my partners hand away when he tried to pinch my nipple.,"So.. my partner loves my nipples. That's fine. When we are being intimate, he can pretty much do whatever to them, within reason, due to the context of the situation. However, I have very sensitive nipples. Sometimes, they just hurt, like after a run or when I'm about to start my period. The latter is what led to this current issue.

I wasn't wearing a bra so he could see them through my shirt. A couple times throughout the day, without warning, he would come up to me in order to pinch my nipple. I back away when he touches me and tell him not to do that because it hurts. I also give him the caveat that if he were to just touch/grab my boob while avoiding the nipple, it will be fine. I am not 100% opposed to spontaneous touching and intimacy. I encourage it. 

He pinched my nipple twice that day, and I told him to stop, twice (while still reassuring him that touching the boob in general is fine). 

He came up to me a 3rd time and tried to pinch my nipple. So I, instinctively without even having time to think, slapped his hand away. He drew his hand back, frowned, and ""apologized"", and then walked away like a scorn puppy. With his arms drawn towards his chest as if he was struggling to control himself, which obviously he was.

I was super frustrated at this point so I couldn't help but display that frustration saying ""How many times do I have to fucking explain this to you?"". I reiterated that I HATE slapping his hand away from me. I don't want him to think I'm absolutely repulsed by him, because that isn't true.

He seemingly felt guilty and left the room.

I wanted to scream at him that HE DOES NOT OWN MY BODY, but I wasn't trying to escalate things further.

He stopped after that, but at the same time he won't accept my offer to merely touch/grab the boob itself. It's like it's all or nothing, and/or he is hurt that I slapped his his hand away.

Can we please stop telling people they will “change their mind when they’re older” when they say they don’t want children?,"This is so frustrating on so many levels.

No one has the authority to tell someone what to do with their bodies and lifestyle choices.  No one has the authority to demean you by dismissing your opinions and pressuring you into their mindset by telling them who they are right now will change when they’re older because “society says it does.”

Some people don’t want children because they don’t want them.  But some people say they don’t want children because they’ve tried and are infertile, have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth, or know that they have genetic predispositions that cause them to not want to chance bringing a child into this world potentially exposing them to an illness or disease.

It’s just so gross to me and feels so very condescending and I really just wish people would stop.

Husband (33M) told me (31F) women without children don't have a purpose,"We have a lot of other marital issues. Things have been said and done that I don't think I can ever get over. But this comment in particular really sent me over the edge.

Before we were married we both agreed we were on the fence about kids. As I've gotten older I haven't felt a strong desire to have any of my own. I love my friends kids. I enjoy kids but I just don't think I want my own. Somehow it came up and my husband was mad that I hadn't changed my mind apparently.

He said to me ""If you don't have kids you have no life purpose. Women's purpose is to have children.""

Um what? Mind you he acts like he's for women, he's progressive, liberal etc whatever you want to say. Then he turns around and says this to me?

I told him that 1) that statement is simply not true and 2) he had no business saying that. I left the room furious and then cried. He apologized the next day saying he was sorry but I can't shake the feeling that this was the final straw.

Has anyone been told this before by a partner? I'm ready to file divorce and feeling like this might have been the final straw.

EDIT: I am slowly catching up on everyone's comments, and I appreciate all the raw honesty from each of you. You're right. He's shown me who he is and now it's my chance to accept that. I've started a separation plan involving me not returning to our home for now.

A short rant about the state of online dating and misogyny.,"I recently ended up a long term relationship and started online dating to see what is out there. I was very excited at first but unfortunately, I'm not anymore. 

I'm shocked at the sheer amount of anti-feminist young men in the platform. Young men openly following Andrew Tate, believing that men are opressed and that the feminist movement wants to end masculity. 

While this young men don't see themselves as misogynist (which they are), they have said things to me such as:
- Men and women are not equal and shouldn't be. 
- Masculinity is being erased. 
- Andrew Tate's ""philosophy"" is good but he should go a bit easier on the anti-women stuff.

I've been lucky enough to find out about their ideas through Instagram as I sometimes post feminist content that they feel compelled to reply to. Even when they haven't watched the whole video. 

While it's only my personal experience, I feel like we are seeing a big push back against the social progress that has occurred in the last decades. In response, I wanted to encourage all of you to post feminist content, to ask your dates about their opinions, and specially to not date or fuck misogynists.

My husband left me for his high-school girlfriend (17 years later),"Long story sorry about that I feel awful.
I just created this reddit account because I'm embarrassed about what just happened to me. I apologize in advance since english is not my first language. 
This happened in late September. I'm 34 years old woman. 
I was with my husband for 5 years, married for 3.
We just had a daughter who was 3 weeks old when he told me he had been ""chatting"" with someone else for the past two months. 

The first thing I asked was if he has sex with her and he said no, so I knew it was worse than what I imagined. My next question was if he loved her and he didn't say anything, so I added do you love me? And his answer was ""I care about you"". Then I asked who is this woman, what the hell?! 

He told me she was a high-school girlfriend that broke up with him (I didn't ask why) and after that he never stopped thinking about her. He is 34 so has been thinking about her at this point for 17 years. I wanted to throw up. I told him I needed to leave immediately. So here comes more background and makes this even shittier. 
I am not a US citizen yet, I came to the US for him. I left a great job at my country, I sold my house and the car that my mom got for me before she died (yes, both of my parents passed already...). So he was everything for me. My life companion, my best friend, my ""coworker"" (we both work from home for different companies but we shared an office and sat one next to the other) we were together all the time and shit I was happy. Happier than ever and he was miserable and I didn't know because he never said anything. We have a 3 year old boy as well. 
I kept asking what happened.

He told me he only saw 3 times this woman and he always had a feeling for her that never felt for anyone else and then I asked why the fuck he started a relationship with me then. He told me that when we met he was in a very bad state of mind thinking no one would like him and he would die alone, then we met and I fell in love with him and I gave him so much love that he thought he could love me back but he always knew I loved him more than he loved me, he never felt that ""feeling"" that felt with the other woman but he thought he ""was broken and was incapable of feeling that again"". 
Ok, so I asked him why he decided to look for this woman now (me being 9 months pregnant, needing him the most), he told me that he wanted to shake those feeling off now because he felt strong enough now to deal with the rejection.

Surprise. 
She didn't rejected him.
Looks like she is in a ""toxic relationship"".

I was like ""dude, she is using you to leave that relationship"" and he tells me he thought about that but he is sure the feeling they both have is real, that she has wrote diaries about him. I wanted to punch him on the face. ""Write diaries?"" Shit, I left my fucking life in my home country for you, have birth your children but she wrote diaries... yeah, she is superior I guess. 
More background he told me that back in high-school she was dating the guy she ended up marrying (that she just left too) she cheated on the boyfriend (now her husband) with my ex. So they have a story and he husband of course hates him and her dad hates him. So he just loves drama I guess. With me everything was so smooth and so nice. We were happy and now he will deal with the ""toxic"" husband and the hateful dad. It makes me sick thinking that my kids might get involved in that madness.
The other part is that he told me he was overwhelmed with our new life, he tells me he never wanted kids. That when we talked about me moving to the US it was me and him. I got pregnant a little before I was able to move so we never had the ""life he had pictured for us"". 

The stupid thing is that the woman also has 2 kids (4 and 7) and the idiot thinks he won't be dealing with them because the father told the woman she is not allowed to take the kids to whoever she is dating (lol). So summary: he was always in love with someone else so he wasn't emotionally available for me, he never loved me 100% and honestly looking back I can see all the red flags about his lack of interest. And he never wanted the kids and now we have 2.

I am in therapy, I went back to my country in early October with my 2 kids to be away from him because I didn't have anything else in the US besides my job now (a great job in engineering so going back or staying in my home country doesn't make sense at all at this point at least). I don't have friends or family. I came back in late December to the US I moved out with the kids to a nice apartment so that's at least something.

When I came back he told me that he did love me and still loves me but that the just ""couldn't pass  the opportunity to try to be with this woman or he would regret for the rest of his life"". So now we are about to file for divorce. It kills me he moved on so fast, like a switch of a button. It drives me nuts.

How do you move on? How do you start all over? I am now feeling I will die alone. If dating was hard not having kids I can't imagine how it will be trying to do that with 2 babies. 

I am scared and so angry.
I know he never loved me like I loved him. He never corresponded my love. And I should've just left him but he made me believe he wanted this too. 
If you made it all the way here, thanks. I guess I needed to vent. This is a nightmare.",1707257844.0,Death-inside-8658,TwoXChromosomes
"Ladies, have you met a redpilled man before? If yes, how did you deal with him? Did he manage to hurt you?","My first time meeting a redpilled man was in college. He was extremely insecure but he loved dominating others in discussion and saying offensive things to his female classmates while framing it as ""a joke"". He also loved bullying women who didn't abide by regular caricatures of femininity. He regularly posted antifeminist quotes/jokes on his social media.

 He didn't attend lectures made by women and always attended ones taught by men. He tried negging me multiple times and told me once ""You can't negotiate Attraction"" (Eww) After I told him that I wanted a partner who has similar views on life like me.

Long story short, I blocked him off social media and stopped talking to him because his toxicity got way out of hand. At that time, I thought I was sensitive and making a big deal out of it. However, now I realize that I did the right thing and that I wouldn't waste a breath while interacting with a man who I suspect believes in that bullshit.

I would appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on your impression about these men in the past vs the view you have of them now.

Edit: I acknowledge that ""redpilled"" could mean being enlightened to the truth of reality, which is unrelated to the manosphere, but here I used it to signify a man who follows and believes in harmful and sexist stereotypes about women and men alike and who engages in behavior encouraged by the ""redpill"" community made for men.

Edit: This the first time my post blew up! Thank you so much for the awards and comments!

Edit Some of your stories may describe men who are misogynistic and who do not consider themselves as ""redpillers"". However, your stories are welcomed as there is a great overlap between misogyny and manosphere redpill.",1611471224.0,AmbitiousDelay,TwoXChromosomes

"My ex just told me to ""get a damn boyfriend"" so our daughter will stop hating going to his place","My heart hurts. I just had to pry my 11yo daughter's arms from around me while she cried ""Don't make me go!""

I sat her dad down (not for the first time) to tell him why she's upset and doesn't want to go to his place. There's no one strong reason. She's jealous of his girlfriend whom he just moved in with, she says she's bored there, that her dad doesn't understand her and that she feels like her soul is sucked out of her when she's there. I tried to be as gentle and diplomatic as I could in explaining to him what's going on with her (and it's not new news). I get that it's hard to hear. And that is frustrating. But...

His response? ""I wish you'd just get a damn boyfriend.""

It hurt. I've been single for almost 7 years. I've dated, had my heart broken, given up a million times, and eventually come to the conclusion that I'm much MUCH happier by myself. But it's hard sometimes. I'm not living in my home country and cultural and language issues factor in. I get lonely. But I've made my life here work and I'm proud of everything I've achieved. 

I've always put everything I have into being the best mom for my daughter when she's with me. Dating, whatever it looks like at whatever time, has been something for the weeks when she's with her dad. I love her so much and I love our time together. And he wants me to take that from her and turn my attention to some dude so she doesn't have it quite so good at my place??

I don't know. The whole thing just has me feeling so shitty and I just needed to get it off my chest somewhere.

To preempt some questions: yes, she's seeing a therapist and yes, I'm sure she's safe over there.

EDIT: Wow, I just woke up to hundreds of messages and comments and I can't express how heartwarming and encouraging it all is for me. Thank you all so much for your kind words and support (and for the laughs I got from some of the less kind comments about my ex). I can't keep up with the replies but I'm reading as much as I can. I want to reassure everyone that I'm keeping a very close eye on things and will work with my daughter's therapist to find a solution that will work for her.

Thank you to everyone who shared stories about amazing single moms. I'm sure they're very proud of the people you've become. And to all the single parents: Stay strong and try not to blame yourself for picking the wrong partner. We're all human and we do silly things for love.

"I've never felt so hurt by the word ""bitch""","I've never been offended by the word ""bitch"" before, that is until today. My female friends and I jokingly call each other ""biotch"". Sometimes I yell at my phone that it's ""being a bitch"" when it isn't working. That changed today when I was filling up my car with gas.

Be me, driving over to wish my little nephew a happy 12th birthday as soon as he gets out of school, but before I have to go to work for the evening. I need to stop by Target to pick up his present, but I realize that my gas tank is empty. I stop by a gas station,  pull up next to a gas pump, and start filling up my car. A man walks out of the gas station store with a wad of cash in each hand (which makes me think he just made a transaction).

""You don't even realize what you did, did you?"" he says to me as he walks towards me. I wonder, what the hell  this guy is talking about and who is he talking to. ""Yeah you, I'm talking to you. You took two lefts getting to the gas station!?"" I point at myself confused because I took a right to get into the gas station. ""Yah, you, you dumb bitch!"" As the guy gets closer, I'm getting a little freaked out. It's the day time, but I am all alone so I'm concerned. ""Okay?"" I respond, hoping that he goes away. I'm wracking my brain trying to remember if I didn't use my turn signal or wasn't slow or careful before turning right, but I don't think I did anything. I also have an older, white Honda model that's pretty common, so I think this guy might have my car confused with another. The guy starts mocking me and yelling ""You don't know how to fucking drive, bitch!"" I start to ignore him as I'm finishing filling up my tank. The guy walks over to his female friend and her car a few gas pumps over from me. He won't stop yelling about me, and at this point, I just want to get the fuck out of there so I can see my nephew.

The worst thing happens. My car alarm is on a hair trigger and starts going off. I'm driving an old model and can't afford the thousand dollars to completely change the alarm system, so I've had to put up with it.  I can't start the car, and there's someone behind me waiting to use the gas pump. I hear the guy maniacally laughing as I'm trying to get my car alarm to shut up. ""Stupid bitch!!! Doesn't even know how to use her own car!"" I start panicking because I'm just trying to leave and this asshole won't leave me alone. Another guy parked next to the jerk starts laughing along with the stranger as well and says ""That shit is funny!"". A female attendant at the gas station comes and tries to help me turn my alarm off. She's really sweet, and gets the car alarm to finally stop, but is unable to get the car started. She goes back to work in the station store after I thank her profusely. Asshole guy loudly yells ""You're going to get in a car accident and die, you fucking bitch!!!"" I wonder why the hell he's still here. I'm now trying to turn my car on without triggering the alarm again. Eventually, I get my car to start. I see the guy and his female friend waving ""goodbye"" to me as they drive away. Seriously, what an asshole. On my drive to spend my nephew's birthday with him, I start breaking down and crying. I've never felt so publicly humiliated by a total stranger. Once I get to a Target to pick up my nephew's birthday present, I call my sister, cry, and apologize for running late. I don't know why, but being called a ""dumb bitch"" really bothered me.

TLDR: A crazy stranger wouldn't stop calling me a ""dumb bitch"" in public at a gas station. I've never been bothered by the word ""bitch"" before, but I felt targeted when a man started using it over and over again against me.

Update: I did not expect this to blow up the way it did (I know, typical thing to say on Reddit). First, I want to say thank you to everyone who was encouraging and sweet in the comments. I've been busy with family and work, but I finally got to read through many of the comments. Thank you for all of the Hugz, Silver, Take my Energy, and Helpful awards. Second, thank you to everyone who gave me advice about how to fix my car alarm. When I bring my car to the repair shop, I'll ask for help to do the things you all suggested. Third, people have gone through some crazy, horrible shit from strangers, all way worse than this situation. I am so sorry that these pieces of shit decided to be assholes to you all. You are a hundred times stronger than the strangers who harassed you.

Extra Update: I went back to the gas station to let the manager know that the female attendant that helped me with my car alarm was really wonderful. I also wanted to make sure that I hadn't made some obvious mistake while I was driving into the parking lot. The manager was really awesome and explained how weird her interaction was with the asshole when he came into the gas station store. He was super cheerful with her, and as soon as he saw me through the window,  his demeanor completely switched. It helps to have a little validation from people around you that you weren't the only confused person. 

I want to clarify that I'm not trying to cancel the word ""bitch"". I'm not offended by guys that I know using is jokingly with me. It was just so strange to hear a total stranger use it against me (you know, along with acting fucking crazy). I also want to clarify that the asshole was not an older guy. He seemed like he was my age, in his twenties. He had dreads and dressed kind of like a ""bro"". People don't have to be from older generations to be intolerant. ALSO, a lot of people have mentioned that he might have been mentally ill, and even if that were true, I know there are many people with mental illness, including myself, who would never treat someone that way. I hope this asshole gets help if he needs it, but then again, he doesn't deserve my sympathy. ",1617714854.0,KrispyKremeFraiche,TwoXChromosomes
"Taking your husband’s last name - is there a good, non-patriarchal reason to do so?","My boyfriend (29) and I (29F) have been together for 5 years, engaged for a few months. He’s a wonderful man and in no way a villain here, so try to hold off on the “leave him now” comments if possible lol.

Although I know taking my fiancé’s last name is something he would absolutely love, I’ve been clear over the entirety of our relationship that it is not something I see myself doing. My name is part of my identity and, most importantly, I haven’t ever been given a good reason for changing my name that isn’t ultimately based in patriarchal tradition. When I ask my fiancé why it’s important to him, he just says that it’s a symbol of commitment and unity as a family, to which I respond, “well if that’s the case why couldn’t you take my last name instead?” In my opinion, this accomplishes the same purpose. 
Admittedly, he doesn’t have a good explanation for why he is also unwilling to change his last name. If I had to give an explanation, I’d of course say this is an example of an ingrained tradition of male superiority which is generally not in keeping with how he lives his life, in and outside of our relationship. We have an equitable division of domestic labor and mental load, and he enthusiastically encourages my hobbies and my personal and career goals/development. 

At the end of the day, he ultimately says that he would love it if I chose to take his name but he respects my decision and it in no way affects his desire to marry me and spend our lives together. 

Of course I want to make him happy but not at the expense of being true to my own convictions. I’m just curious if anyone out there, whether you’ve changed your name or not, can give me a genuinely good reason to do so that isn’t based on patriarchal tradition and mysogyny.

I started staring back at men who openly stare at me and it’s life changing,"It feels so icky at first, but once you get past that, it has been the most liberating thing I’ve done in a long time.  I realized that when I go out in public, at the grocery store or the gym or whatever, I tend to avoid any eye contact with strange men. I can feel their eyes on me, but I have become really skilled at pretending I don’t, and always looking at things behind them, below them, above them to avoid acknowledging their stare.  

And I realized that my motivation for that is because it makes me SO uncomfortable to be stared at like a zoo animal, and because I don’t want them to be encouraged to approach me.  And I realized that that is bullshit.  So I just did it.  I walked into the grocery store, eyes up.  Man starts looking and I looked straight back, slack faced, no expression.  He reacted very weirdly: held the eye contact for too long, then realized it and looked away, but then looked right back and smiled.  I just kept staring back and he stopped smiling and turned around and walked away.  It was fucking amazing.  I highly recommend it, marvelous feeling.",1600436781.0,fartfaceallday,TwoXChromosomes
uncomfortable & stifling issue with this sub. ,"to the mods, i'm aware of the rules & the report button. i'm sure we all use them generously, but it's still really upsetting that this has to be mentioned. 

i used to come to this sub to discuss my woman-centric experiences. confide in other women who share my traumas in life & find an accepting community of women online. i live in a non western country with very poor treatment of women. our prime minister publicly encouraged the beating of wives if they ""misbehave"" and SA charges go nowhere. it's a very culturally conservative country and, especially in my city, women don't have many places where they find support. no working women's shelters either. a lot of us living outside of the west look for spaces online for support. 

every time i come here and a woman makes a post with the most MINUSCULE feminist intent, or sharing her trauma, or difficulties in her personal experiences, it doesn't just get downvoted to oblivion, but filled up with comments of dudes adding their two cents, tone policing, making sexual & or fetish comments or ""not all men""ing her. 
this is a woman centric community. two X chromosomes. we aren't going to make our tones softer, be gentler and tip-toe around our individual experiences to make YOU, a dude, comfortable. 

commenting is fine, lurking & interacting is fine. but genuinely, what do you think a woman opening up about her abuse situation, or misogyny is gaining from your ""male perspective"" or your personal experience with your wife? (random example, not referencing anyone or any particular specific comment) seriously.

the woman experience unfortunately includes the systematic, personal & individual oppression that we go through. it is essential that we get a place where we can share these experiences. this sub isn't just going to be pink with glitter and sparkles and makeup advice. if these serious posts are uncomfortable to you, i'm sorry. but, we aren't going to go out of our ways to make this sound more digestible for you. we have to walk through our lives doing that already. 

i'm aware that reddit is a breeding ground of misogyny in general, but getting downvoted & getting replies of men attempting to debate in a two X chromosome subreddit for feminist views? that is incredibly uncomfortable. 

i don't mean to insinuate that i would want subs to be gender segregated, but these couple of days i've spoken to many women here who share this same discomfort. i don't know what else to do, i've stopped visiting this sub from genuine discomfort which is sad, because previously i found a community and supportive comments here.

"Tried looking up advice on my relationship problems from the perspective of my boyfriend to see what advice he's getting, instantly regretted it.","This is a bit of an older story, but I just want to share.

So for information, me and my (now ex) boyfriend were having problems because we have very different sex drives. He wanted to have sex AT LEAST once a day, and I really could only manage once every few days. He started to get really frustrated about it. We talked about it of course and it was obvious that it was not something I could compromise on safely and consensually.

Anyways, I started looking up (for myself) what to do. Most sources (for women) online told me that this is normal, and that sometimes people just aren't sexually compatible. The authors suggested finding new ways to excite myself or considering terminating the relationship.

I figured my boyfriend must have been looking to the internet for advice/support as well, so I tried looking it up from his perspective. The top articles that came up were pretty disgusting. Almost all of them encouraged him to cheat on me, most of them said something to the effect of ""if she were really attracted to you, she'd put out"", most also told him I might be gay (GAY? Just because I can't have sex everyday?), most of them suggested he attempt to make me feel jealous by flirting with other women or EVEN MY FRIENDS, A lot of them also suggested he threaten to leave me. To be fair, these were just the top articles to pop up.

I talked to him about what I read one night and he admitted that he had seen some of those articles too. I explained to him how all of that is TERRIBLE and CRUEL advice and he completely agreed. We had a laugh about it. We broke up for different reasons. It's just sad.

Egypt is a hellhole and no one cares,"First of all, i am literally typing in tears , i feel so helpless and insignificant, i feel like i am fighting a losing fight Everytime i speak


And i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, 


We have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself ""sheikhs have said that"" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell


But in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say ""they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes"" 


Then u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men


They are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked ""what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?"" He replied "" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them""


WHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything


Imagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like ""get out of here we don't want sluts like you here"" ""hey prostitute come to me after him please""


And the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose


I open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts 


Any woman who tries to say anything is branded an ""atheist"" and a dumb ""feminist"", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street


And why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling


No, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism


I have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything


I always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want


If anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help 


Please do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us


(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)
 
Going even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told ""when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please"", newsflash ,nope

There was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said ""it's up for debate, did you see what they wore"", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying

Women get called horrible shit and bullied online, people ""sliding""into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm

People who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered ""cool"" people ""living the life""

People of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go ""look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country"" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much

(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)

But i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all

I never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,
Plus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently

People will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want 

I am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not ""he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this""


And if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following

The problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt",1593974977.0,_JohnTheAwesome_,TwoXChromosomes

&#x200B;

*How it started*

I first noticed it what was happening I was driving him and my other sister to the mall on Black Friday. Seemingly out of no where, he asked us why there hasn’t ever been a female president.

In an awkward and maybe difficult to comprehend way, I started to explain that historically positions of power have been limited to a specific demographic and while there aren’t in current laws specifically preventing a woman from being president, no women has had the opportunity yet.

He stopped me at some point and told me that women were just too incompetent hold positions of power and there were a lot of things that men do a whole lot better than women.

As we started to go back on forth on it, I realized what was happening. I’d heard all of these weird manosphere talking points a million times and he was just recycling bad tiktock content.

I don’t want to go to far into the details because it’s a lot but, he’s said and done a lot of way worse stuff since then. Pretty much everyone in our immediately family has tried to talk to him about it (both individual and as a kind of intervention) and has eventually just given up with the hope that it’s just some messed up stage that he’ll eventually grow out of.

He’s was raised as the youngest child and the only boy in a single mom household, so I ever expected him to end up like this. Now, pretty much all of my other sisters keep him at a distance and make occasional jokes to each other about how he’s probably gonna end up in jail for beating women (or worse) when he grows up.

When we used to argue about the dumb misogynistic shit he get’s from the internet, I can see the corners of his mouth curl up into a smile when he get’s me upset or angry. When I ask him how he could take pleasure in seeing someone he cares about in distress, he denies it or mocks me further, he really is becoming a kind of a cruel kid.

&#x200B;

*The incident and me being a bad adult*

The last time I tried to talk to him about this stuff, he ended up getting violent with me and repeatedly punching me in the face. He’s tried to hit me a few times before that but, there had always been family there to hold him back from attacking me.

He’s only 13 but he’s already 5’10 and has strength comparable to an adult man (by comparison I’m like 107 lbs and 5’3). I’d never been hit like that by anybody before and authentically terrified, I ended up having a very embarrassing and loud panic attack and we’ve pretty much kept away from each other ever since.

I’m not completely innocent in the situation. He was defending Andrew Tate and I asked him how he could follow advice from a man who had raped and sexually exploited so many women. He went on to deny any of it ever happened and used a lot of really mean victim blaming rhetoric in Tate’s defense.

At some point, I thought I could get him to take the situations seriously if I told him about some of my SA experiences from the military. He mocked and victim blamed me and I just couldn’t take it. I shoved a 13 yo autistic kid and he immediately went into a rage and started punching me over and over again with as much force as he possibly could as I started sobbing and wailing (quite humiliatingly), curled up into a ball, and tried to use my hand to block as much of the impact as I possibly could. I know I was wrong but I never thought I’d have such traumatic experiences mocked by anyone, let alone my own brother. I can't change the past but I know that'll I'll never do that shit again.

&#x200B;

*Wtf should I even do at this point, if anything*

I don’t know what to do, I hate the kid but I still love him and want to help. He’s on the spectrum and had learning disabilities and I know life isn’t easy for him. I wish I could just hang out with him and get him out the house and interested in new hobbies until he stops caring about stupid manosphere shit but, it’s complicated. I’m not sure if I should just keep away to avoid lashing out and being an asshole to a literal child (or getting myself hurt physically speaking).

I know my mom isn’t the best parent and won’t be much help to him, even though she does try in her own way. Speaking of, my mom avoids certain topics because he has been aggressive and physically threatening to her in the past. When he’s not around, sometimes she half-jokes about how if she tried to take away his computer he’d probably snap and beat the shit out of her.

&#x200B;

*Notes:*

*- I know he needs therapy but all of that’s kind of in my moms hands; she’s interested but has been moving slowly on it, despite my encouragement*

\- *I can’t call the cops on him if he get violent because we’re black and there a slight chance they might shoot one of us for racism and stuff*

*- He's on the spectrum, you can't put a percentage on Autism but it's to the extent where although most people don't notice not neurotypical upon first impression, people with experience working with kids like him are generally pretty quick to pick up on it*

&#x200B;

**edit:**

**I was not expecting this post to blow up a little bit. I was super embarrassed about posting this and avoided checking reddit because I felt really guilty about the whole thing and was honestly fully expecting ridicule. I definitely feel less weird and more validated.**

**Last night, I decided to try to have a conversation about everything that happened and everything that lead up to it and offer my friendship and guidance and he was pretty receptive. He's autistic and had a meltdown and feels really bad about hurting me. Asking him a lot of questions while trying be as non-confrontational as possible seemed to help a lot.**

**Also, to all the people saying that he needs juvi, I really don't think that helps kids, it just makes them scared and angry and confused. Also, we're black, getting a little black boy involved with the criminal justice system sometimes ends up becoming a life-long situation.**

&#x200B;

**edit 2:**

**Just to be clear, no one in my family openly mocks or laughs at him. There have been occasional jokes when he's not present, but everyone is almost exclusively kind and supportive in his actual presence.**

**My family and I are a group of deeply unserious people and we generally tend to laugh with each other a lot. I think when they make these jokes, they're kind of a way of acknowledging how serious the situation is without making everyone feel awful and sad.**

**The reality of the situation is if we can't help him before get get's older, he might do something really bad later on in life, and that's a hard pill to swallow. Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.**

**It's not perfectly mature, but we're all our 20's and have some growing up to do. And I'll give my mom a pass because as much as they love each other, he really does put her through hell a regular.**",1688877671.0,who_is_confused,TwoXChromosomes
I wish having a bad period/period cramps was an acceptable reason to stay home from school/work,"Can we please have one freebie day a month to stay home and deal with our cramps in a comfortable place?

Edit: I appreciate everyone’s unique perspectives and enjoyed reading about different points of view from y’all! 

Taking everyone’s responses into consideration, I think “freebies” was a poor choice of words. There are no true freebies in life. I think addressing a few underlying problems would make a huge difference in the workplace for everybody:

1. Women’s healthcare is horrendous in the US. Doctors are less likely to take women’s pain and symptoms seriously, and it is harder for women to get a diagnosis for a health problem than it is for men. A Danish study by Westergaard et al. found that on average, it takes FOUR YEARS longer for women to get a diagnosis than it does for men with the same illness (I had trouble finding a similar study done in the US, if you know of one please let me know!) for health conditions that cause debilitating periods, such as endometriosis, it can take 6-10 YEARS to get a diagnosis because of these gender biases. It’s easy to tell somebody “If it’s THAT bad, then go see a doctor.” In an ideal world that would be a perfect solution, but the reality is that many women are dismissed by doctors and do not get the diagnosis and treatment they need. 

2. In the US (I’m sure this is relatable to people from many other countries but I’m just going to speak from my own experiences) profit is valued over employee health. This is a problem, because health insurance is tied to our employment. We live in a country where taking any time off is frowned upon and people are encouraged to go into work sick. It is not uncommon for employers to provide their employees with the cheapest, most basic healthcare plan that may not cover an employee’s needs just to meet their legal requirements. There is a such thing as private insurance but that is an expensive option that a lot of people can’t pay for. I think there are many underlying issues with the way healthcare in the US is set up, but I think across the board everybody could benefit from more PTO and sick time than we are currently given, and it should be acceptable to take that time off as we see fit.  

Thank you for everybody’s input, I kept up with reading your comments for as long as I could. I’m glad this sparked a healthy discussion.",1599092301.0,alohakakahiaka12,TwoXChromosomes
"The worst, most backward day of my life","I’m 20 years old and a sophomore in college. I didn’t get my period yet this month so over the weekend I decided to take a pregnancy test and it turns out I’m pregnant. I knew I was going to terminate the pregnancy immediately since I’m in no position to care for a child at this point in my life. I called my boyfriend, my parents, and my best friend, and they were all supportive of my decision. After crying and getting over the shittiness of the situation, I made an appointment for a non surgical (medical) abortion. The appointment was for today, so this morning I called an Uber (I don’t have a car on campus) and headed to the clinic which was an hour away. 

My Uber driver seemed immediately uncomfortable and asked if we were going to a planned parenthood. I said no (which was the truth), we were just going to a doctors appointment. Still, he seemed uncomfortable. “Is it an abortion clinic?” The color drained from my face; how could he know? I just put the address of the doctor in, and there was nothing in the name that would imply it was an abortion clinic.  He stared at me, waiting for an answer, but I was too shocked to reply. I couldn’t believe this was happening, and now I was trapped in the car with this guy for the next hour. “You know,” he said, “you’re going to regret this decision for the rest of your life.” He started telling me about the procedure, what it was like, telling me how horrible it was. “There’s so much they don’t tell you. You’re making a mistake”. He brought up his wife, who was 5 months pregnant, but trailed off. I just sat there in silence. We were driving through rural land, miles from any kind of house or storefront. I prayed he wouldn’t hurt me.

We got about halfway there when he suddenly pulled over on the side of the road. “I’m sorry, I can’t take you any farther than this. You won’t find another Uber out here. I can take you back if you want.” I politely declined and got out of the car. I immediately started calling local taxi companies and asked if they could pick me up. My phone gave me a rough location which I gave them as my pickup address. My Uber driver waited around for about 15 minutes, assuming I’d change my mind. I insisted I was fine and that he should go back and he eventually left. After waiting about 25 minutes, the cab showed up and I got to my appointment (an hour late).

Even thinking about this experience brings tears to my eyes. I can’t believe someone would be this cruel. An abortion is already traumatic enough, and not at all a decision I take lightly. That an older man would corner me and confront me about decisions that are none of his business are astounding. I contacted Uber and I can only pray they take appropriate action. 

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words! The thousands of internet hugs have made a huge difference. I reported him to Uber, and Uber got back to me and refunded the ride and said they were “reviewing his account”. I hope to God he’s fired. 

For all the people who say I deserved this kind of treatment, I have nothing to say to you. I come from a politically conservative family, so I understand being pro life and disagreeing with my decision to terminate my pregnancy. However, the driver was aware of my decision to get an abortion within 10-15 minutes of picking me up from all his probing questions. If he wasn’t comfortable driving me to the clinic, why continue to drive me there until we were stranded? Was it an impulsive decision to leave me by the side of the road, or was it premeditated after he understood our destination? He easily could have left me in my small city and I would have been able to get a different Uber driver and avoided the whole fiasco that ensued. Or, as others have pointed out, he could have simply declined the ride if the destination (and my decision to exercise my rights) were that offensive to him. 

I have no issue with him (or anyone else) having a different opinion or with him disagreeing with my choices. But your beliefs do not give you the right to make me feel uncomfortable when I’m completely vulnerable and am relying on you to perform a service I desperately need. 

I’m debating posting something in r/legaladvice because I fear the possibility that this could happen again with another young woman (or man) who happened to be doing something or was about to engage in a behavior he personally deemed objectionable. Who else has he stranded, and who else will be stranded yet? 

If there are further developments I will update all of you! Again, thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. I had no idea my post would blow up like this and it makes me feel good knowing people of the internet have my back. You guys are awesome and this subreddit is amazing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 

Also: thank you kind Redditors for the gold, silver and platinum!! I will make sure this never happens to someone else again.

Update 2: As I commented below, the reason my parents or boyfriend couldn’t drive me is because they both live in North Carolina while I go to school in New York. My boyfriend couldn’t afford to buy a last minute flight to see me, and because I live in a dorm room with a roommate, there would have been no place for him to stay. My parents did manage to get a last minute flight, but they didn’t get one in time to take me to my appointment. ",1553168630.0,molesterstall0ne,TwoXChromosomes
My Doctor called me ‘sad’ for wanting an abortion after my birth control failed.,"Throwaway account. As the title states my birth control failed and I found out last week I was pregnant. My husband (30M) and I (26F) discussed our options in depth but we can barely financially support ourselves currently and I cannot do my job while pregnant due to the company’s insurance and associated risks. I am a contractor and would lose my job immediately if my employer found out. We want to be parents someday but it’s not the right time and we have no support from family/ friends. We also both grew up in poverty and swore we would never do that to our future children. 

After a lot of long discussions we decided that, since it’s so early in the pregnancy, abortion is the best way forward. I did my best to be informed and do my research as to where to go and who to talk to but felt like I was going in circles so I figured my best bet was to talk to my GP and go from there (the closest Planned Parenthood type clinic is two+ hours away). I thought she might be able to provide more information or, at the very least, confirm that I am pregnant.

This is where my asshat of a doctor comes in. I’ve been seeing her for about two years and she is the typical 2 minutes at most with you doctor. She really doesn’t seem to have any f***s to give when it comes to her patients and makes you feel like you are wasting everyone’s time if you ask her questions.

Knowing this, I made sure to call and be very specific about my needs telling them I was pregnant and needing an abortion. The staff assured me multiple times that I needed to come into the office to speak to my doctor about it and would not provide anymore details in terms of cost or what to expect etc.

I show up for the appointment with my husband and am asked when I check in what the appointment is for. I tell them that I am pregnant and need to discuss my options, receptionist enters it in and tells me to have a seat. When we finally get taken into a room, the nurse asks me again what I am here for and again I say I’m pregnant and need to discuss abortion options. She writes it down without saying anything, takes my blood pressure and leaves.

Enter Dr. Asshat, stage left.

Dr. A - “Hello. Why are you here today?”

Me -“ I’m pregnant and need to discuss my options for...”

Dr. A - (interrupting) “How do you know? At home pregnancy tests?”

Me - “Yes, I’ve taken a couple and they all came out....”

Dr. A - (interrupting) “So you need a referral for pre-natal care.”

Me - “Um no, we’re not ready to have a child yet and I wanted to discuss our options with you”

Dr. A - (long pause while she looks at me, disgusted) “You mean you want an abortion? Really? An abortion? Ugh. (Makes aggressive eye contact with me) That’s sad. (Looks at my husband, expectantly. Long pause while she stares daggers at us. Then rustles paperwork and get up as if to leave) We don’t do that here. No one in the area does.”

Me -“Ok, but when I called I specifically told them this is what I needed and they told me....”

Dr. A - (interrupting whilst huffing out a sigh like I’m the slowest idiot she’s ever dealt with) “I can refer you to someone for pre-natal care but that’s it. Nothing else. We don’t do anything like that. There isn’t anywhere near here that even does...those. You’ll have to figure that out on your own.”

Me -“Ok, but when I called I specifically told them I needed an abortion and they told me I had to schedule an appointment to talk to you.”

Dr. A - (continuing to gather up her paperwork) “We’ll just cancel this appointment then, is that all?”

Me - “Um yes, that was all”

Dr. A - (walking out without a backward glance) “go down the hall to the right.”
End scene.

I ended up getting a refund for my co-pay and bawling my eyes out in the parking lot while my husband hugged me. I have been so stressed about this (on top of being exhausted, dealing with morning sickness, and crazy emotional swings) and she made me feel like a despicable human being and utterly worthless. 

I understand that she is allowed to have her own opinions on the matter and has every right to disagree with our choice. However, as a medical professional that I entrust my care to, she does NOT have the right to make shitty comments about that choice and she does not have the right to treat me/us the way she did. (The clinic she works for is not religiously affiliated and does not have any posted information anywhere about being anti-choice.)

My husband and I are both upset and angry but have not, and will not, change our minds on this. I’ll also be finding a new GP as soon as humanly possible.

Edit -Holy shit y’all are amazing. I went for a walk to try and clear my head (can’t stay upset for long watching an exuberantly happy pup on a walk) and came back to such an outpouring of love and support and I’m so overwhelmed. THANK YOU to everyone who wrote encouraging words and to those that gave much needed advice. I have an appointment with the aforementioned Planned Parenthood and have transportation so hopefully this whole situation will be resolved in no time. I am working my way through the comments and doing my best to reply where I can. Thank you all. You will never know just how much of an impact you’ve had. I no longer feel like my husband an I are alone in this 💜

Edit 2 - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AWARDS!! Thanks for even more encouraging comments and for the silver and gold guys. Y’all really do know how to turn a gal’s day around. My husband and I can’t thank you enough for the support! Thank you for the loving comments and messages. Thank you to all those that messaged with offers of rides or funds. Thank you!!

Also just a few bits of info for y’all that are asking;
- I do live in the US (crazy this shit is still happening here, right?) in Florida specifically.
- I have called and set up an appointment with the most ‘local’ PP office and do have transportation there. 

Lastly: to those lovely individuals sending me expletive and hate filled messages; save your breath. I’m not reading them and clearly you have your own personal issues to work out with all that copious free time currently spent on badly written hate mail. Please seek help for your violent tendencies so that you can handle having adult conversations with people without throwing a tantrum and using the word ‘cunt’.

Edit 3 - Last edit y’all! Thank you so much for all of the messages, chats, and comments. I’ve done my best to respond to everyone, if I missed you I’m sorry. My husband and I are incredibly thankful for this community and the support you’ve shown us today. I will continue to respond as I can. From the bottom of my heart, thank you!! Thank you to all those that shared their stories in support and offered a shoulder to lean on should we need it. You’ve made us feel so loved and I could never thank you enough.",1578500582.0,meepmeepinajeep,TwoXChromosomes
I read my Victim Impact Statement in court yesterday. My rapist cried when I read it. So did the judge. Afterwards he apologized to me and... I believed him. It was a beautiful moment.," TW:  Sexual Assault/Violence, Court Proceedings

\*\*\*UPDATE:  Words cannot express my emotional day reading each and every single one of your comments and messages. There were so many who offered encouragement and praise, I was brought to tears more times than I can count. I am truly humbled by the out pour of support and I feel honored that many felt the courage to reach out to me about their own personal experiences.

I feel the need to provide this update because there were some common themes in responses where I think additional context may be appreciated.

1. Yes, he is in prison and he will be there for quite some time. But no, I do not know if my statement impacted the judge’s decision on length of the sentence. In my state, the victim reads their statement before the judge decides the sentence but after the Defendant has already been found guilty to the crime so, in other words, his crying/apology and my statement in no way allowed him to ‘get out’ of the charges since he was already convicted of the crime by the Court. While the judge displayed empathy/emotions in reaction to my statement, when they were ultimately explaining reasoning for their sentencing decision (and I’m paraphrasing) ‘It is the Court’s responsibility to protect the safety of the community. When all is said and done, the Defendant committed a violent crime and the Court cannot ignore that.’ I was told by the Prosecutor that the sentence he received was in line with what one would typically receive for a crime like this.   

2. I’ve received many questions about Restorative Justice (RJ) and notice that it’s sparked some discussion in the comments. I first learned about RJ in a 60 Minutes episode (Season 51, episode 30, air date May 13, 2019). The host begins the segment with ‘’When we first learned about the RJ Project, it was hard to believe and we certainly didn’t understand it. The program… introduces victims of violence to the convicts who committed the crime. Our first reaction was ‘Who would want to do that, and to what end?’’ Yes, RJ is a very personal choice. It is not for everybody. And that’s certainly okay!  The purpose of our Court system is to hold offenders criminally responsible for their crime but it does little to hold them accountable for the healing of the victim (and other affected parties for that matter). RJ is, in many ways, a solution for many victims and offenders who *voluntarily* choose to do it. Yes, it may not be the perfect solution but please remember that this is an imperfect system. The Defendant’s participation in RJ will in no way affect his sentence. He will not get out early for choosing to participate nor he will not get additional time for refusing to either. It is simply a way for him to have the chance take accountability for the impact on the victim and allows for the opportunity to make things right using facilitation by professionals. Emphasis is placed on avoiding re-victimization at all costs.  Who knows, perhaps I'll change my mind about wanting to pursue RJ, but at least I have the option, and I will be forever grateful to the Judge for understanding and allowing it.  If and when it takes place, which wouldn't be anytime soon, he will still be in prison and I would be visiting him there.

3. I received an overwhelming amount of messages with a common theme of MeToo. I wept with each one I read. To all of you I say, stay strong but also, remember to be kind to yourself. Continue to do what feels right to you. And don’t feel like anyone has the right to make you feel ashamed or guilty for how you feel.  Remember, after someone experiences trauma, they deserve to feel and process it in whichever way is natural to them. If you are rape victim like me, you are used to not being believed. But don’t ever feel like you have to ‘prove’ yourself to anyone. I too have moments of weakness and forget my own advice but again, in these moments, please be kind and gentle on yourself. You are doing the best you can in that moment. 

Thank you again for your outpouring of well wishes and support. I am so truly touched by your messages <3 <3 <3

TW:  sexual assault, violence, court proceedings

&#x200B;

I spent 13-1/2 long months waiting for justice after being raped by a stranger in an alley.  Yet, when it finally came time to write my Victim Impact Statement, I couldn't seem to put pen to paper.  I spent weeks working on it.  Then, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that mercy, empathy and healing were more important to me than any anger I had left.  After I realized that, I wrote my entire statement in one night.

When I looked up after reading it in court, I saw tears coming down the judge's face.  When I looked over at my rapist, he was crying too.  So was his family.  And so was mine.  The judge approved the only request I had, to allow for Restorative Justice programming if/when we would ever want to pursue that.  Afterward the hearing, the Victim's Advocate gave me a hug and thanked me for having the courage to say something so powerful.  I told her I meant every word.

It's hard to describe how I feel but what I can say is that it feels like a HUGE weight has been taken off my shoulders.   I will remember this experience the rest of my life and it brings me comfort to feel like I can finally start to let go.  Anyways, I have included the statement in this post - bear with me, it's a tad long.  But I feel the need to get this off of my chest.  Please remember that crime affects everyone differently and in my case, I felt like empathy and the need to pursue a different avenue (restorative justice) was right for me.  However, I can completely understand how others in this situation may feel the exact opposite.  At the end of the day though, Everyone deserves to feel how they feel!

\*\*\*Victim Impact Statement - TW:  sexual violence, anal rape mention

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me this opportunity to address the Court today.

This crime that the Defendant committed against me has affected every facet of my life.

Before all this happened, I knew who I was and I liked who I was. I was certain that the groundwork provided by my education, my military service, and flourishing professional career would stand me in good stead whatever challenges may lay ahead. I was proud, I was independent, and optimistic about my future. But unfortunately, the actions of the Defendant on one horrible night irreversibly changed me and the course of my life in so many ways.  After this, it felt like my life wasn’t mine anymore. In one night, he shattered me into a thousand pieces, and I have spent the last 13 ½ months cleaning up the mess he made.

For a long time, I was not a functioning person. After this happened, I couldn’t sleep for months. I stayed up, rocking back and forth with the lights on, my bedroom door barricaded because I was so afraid. You see, Your Honor, when you don’t know where your attacker is, then he is everywhere. He is every sound in the night. Every noise outside your window. Always coming to get you. I spent endless nights unable to sleep, plagued by nightmares replaying what had happened to me. There were many days I couldn’t even get out of bed, let alone leave my house. When I did manage to get out, I was in a constant state of hypervigilance, jumping at every little sound or movement behind me. I missed countless hours at work and my performance suffered as a result. I fell behind on my bills, even my mortgage at one point, and am still working on picking up the pieces in the many other areas of my life.

For weeks, I cried every time I went to the bathroom because of the pain from the injuries, a constant reminder of the worst night of my life. I am often riddled with anxiety and every time I feel frozen with panic, I am reminded of the sheer terror I felt while he was raping me to the point that I could barely move. I still wish I would’ve fought back harder but, in hindsight, my body was frozen in both fear and pain. The moment he inserted himself into me anally, an act that I had never experienced before that moment, it felt like my body had been split into two. The kind of pain where you’re frozen in place. A kind of pain I will surely never forget. It consumes you and there is nothing you can do. When it was over, I remember running away from him in fear, thinking that he would surely come after me. Another feeling that still sticks with me to this day. The flashbacks did not begin for several months but once they did, they came with a fury. On a good day, they would last for only a few seconds, leading me into a panic attack with a lingering aftermath lasting a day or two. On a bad day, they went on for what seemed like hours and were every bit as physically and emotionally painful as the real event often resulting in several days of missed work to recover. On the worst day, I was hospitalized.

For the first time in my life, I am taking medications for things like anxiety, sleep, mood, and nightmares. Over the past year, I’ve attended over 30 appointments with my medical providers, most of them for psychiatric services or mental health therapy, but several were also for mental health urgent care and even one hospitalization. I am very fortunate to receive low cost healthcare because without it, I’m not sure I would be in the place I am today.  In total, my medical bills amounted to only hundreds of dollars, as reflected in the Restitution form, but more so I think they truly represent the significant impact this has had on me.

For a long time, my faith in others was destroyed. I silently condemned every man I didn’t know, since I automatically assumed that their only intention was to harm me. I felt unreasonable revulsion for any individuals who looked like the Defendant, making it nearly impossible at times to interact with fellow colleagues, my healthcare professionals, and even some friends, all at no fault of their own, but all because they simply resembled the Defendant.

I think it’s worth mentioning that I do not know the Defendant, Mr <removed name>, he is a complete stranger to me. I am not ‘out to get him’ because I don’t even know him. I still remember the officer asking me if I knew the name of the man who had raped me, and I realized I had no idea who he was, a feeling I fear may stay with me for a very long time to come. In fact, I did not even learn his name until several days after he was arrested when someone at the DA’s office casually brought it up in conversation without the slightest idea that I was hearing his name for the first time. I’ll never forget that moment. It took my breath away. Even now, over a year later, there’s a sort of empty hole inside of me because of this and there’s not a single day that goes by where I don’t think about what the Defendant did to me.

Probably the most unpleasant feeling is that of the lasting guilt. Not for the rape-- that was on the Defendant -- But for the consequences of doing the “right thing” and reporting to the authorities: putting a man behind bars and causing his loved ones to suffer immensely.  I think about this often.

The punishment he receives today will no doubt be difficult for him, but I am someone who generally looks for the best in people and I have to believe that you, Mr. <removed name>, are strong enough to overcome this, and that somewhere in the process you will seize the opportunities for healing and growth. The most important thing is to ensure events like these don’t happen, ever.

In reality, I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life and what I seek more than anything else is peace of mind. Having, in a sense, been served with my own sentence, I must find a way to live out my life in peace. If it were up to me, the only resolution I would seek is that of restorative justice. I want nothing more than for the Defendant to take responsibility for his actions, understand the significant impact that this has had on not only me, but many others in both of our lives, and to learn from this, so that all parties involved can move on with their lives. Which leads me to the only request I have for you today, Your Honor, I ask that you consider amending the No Contact Order to allow for an exception for the case of restorative justice programming.

I understand that this is not the time or place to facilitate restorative justice practices and that the purpose of the judicial court is to hold individuals criminally responsible for their actions so, I will only say this further. I hope one day, Mr <removed name>, you can find the courage from knowing that your participation in this type of programming will not result in punitive punishment. You know what happened on the night of January <removed specific date>, 2019. You know and I know. And you can’t erase that.  Most importantly, remember that you are paying the price of your own choices, while I have to pay the price of a choice that you did not give me. This request I ask of the Judge today is about giving you the opportunity to take accountability for your actions and a chance to make things right, not only for you and me, but for all of our loved ones who have been affected by this as well.

I sincerely hope that you find strength, companionship, and moments of peace to reflect in these difficult days. I wish safety, health, and continued support from your loved ones while in incarceration. I know that I would not have made it here today without the incredible support network that I have found in my family, colleagues, and friends since this happened. After finishing your punishment, I sincerely hope you reintegrate quickly into society and go on to live a happy life. Most importantly, I hope you are able to find the inner courage within to accept accountability for your actions.

And with that being said, I leave here today, Your Honor, with a sense of peace, confident in knowing that whatever you decide for sentencing today will be appropriate and just. After all, justice is not justice, if it is not just for all.

Thank you",1584237916.0,emmmalee,TwoXChromosomes
How bad is stealthing? Does someone deserve to have their life ruined over doing it? Brutal honesty please!!,"I (24F) went and reported my soon to be ex husband (39M) for slealthing me. The police told me that we could move forward if I want to give a statement and try to get a conviction. I know stealthing is essentially rape, but I've got a couple of questions.

He said sorry and that he didn't think it was a big deal, but he knew of my history of sexual assault. He said it was a big mistake. Is it possible for a man his age to not know the severity of what he did? He will be deported soon after I file for divorce as he's on a partner visa, so is that consequence enough? Would whether his apology was sincere or not make a difference to you if you were in this position?

Brutal honesty is very welcome. I need to know if I'm being a dramatic idiot because of my past trauma. I just need the fresh perspectives of people who don't know me, so I can look at this from all angles. Thank you all in advance 🌻

Edit to say that I was on the pill and he knew it, so I doubt it was about getting me pregnant. We'd had sex a few times without a condom, but I preferred the extra protection a condom offered. And I'm glad I did, too, because I just found out a friend of mine is pregnant and she was on the pill.

Also, where I am, he would've gotten citizenship if we'd stayed married longer. He wouldn't need to get me pregnant for that.

The way Reddit speaks of children that are a result of cheating makes me ill.","I just read a thread in relationship advice about a man whose wife cheated on him and his 9 year old daughter is not his. A good part of those comments were not only encouraging him to leave her, they were justifying and celebrating that. In fact, many comments went as far as claiming how her father abandoning her wouldn't even be traumatic for her or how it would be best for everyone, including her. How this is possible is beyond me.

Reddit usually doesn’t affect me. But right now I feel so angry I have a pounding headache.

Please let me introduce myself. Hello everyone, I am ‘nothing but a reminder of deception’ and ‘reminder of a betrayal every single day’ and an ‘something that would raise only resentment’, ‘not his daughter’, ‘unfortunate consequence of whoring’.

My parents had a very unhappy marriage. Lots of cheating and arguing. My mother cheated on my father when she was 25 with my father’s best friend (on a side note, my father had cheated on her and continued cheating on her after his. In fact, they had this cycle of revenge where my mother would cheat to get back to my dad for his affair.). She fell pregnant and gave birth to me. I was 11 when I found out about it. It was the most traumatic period of my life and I am still recovering from it, 12 years later. My grandparents and other family members cut out contact with me. I am not allowed in their house, I have not received anything from them nor spoke to them for the last 12 years, unlike my brothers. I was present in the room when my grandmother explained how my father should not hold me in his arms because I am bastard, unlike my two brothers. I know my grandparents straight out told him to never see me again. During this period, I started urinating my bed at night and having mental breakdowns at school. I was so terrified of my father leaving me that I had my suicide planned in case the day he would realize I wasn’t worthy of his love because of my genetics would come. I wasn’t just scared, I was horrified. I remember being so anxious I had daily trouble with just breathing.

But my father didn’t do that. What he did instead was consoling me, again and again, on how much he loved me. He came to school after I locked myself in the bathroom with scissors to defend me. He did not once exclude me from the time he had with us (the kids). I was always afraid he would come to pick us up but leave with only my brothers, leaving me behind.  But that never happened, the contrary. He always had time for all of us and interest in our lives, despite working brutally long hours. He has been my biggest inspiration, my biggest motivator. He is always there when I need him. Just writing about my dad brings tears to my eyes. He is a man who learned how to do a french braid so I didn't have hair on my face when I was at my practice.

I just texted him, thanking him from being my dad. He replied: “I love you. being your dad is my privilege.”

ps. I just have to point out that I have read countless comments in Reddit that justify men cheating and having affairs. And not only justify them, but glorify it. In fact, there are entire subs dedicated to that.

Edit: Thank you. I am overwhelmed by the kinds messages and somehow it is very soothing after the hundreds of messages that felt personally insulting and degrading. Not only that, pretty much dehumanizing. Thank you. I am glad I wrote this.",1556402045.0,DeceptionChild,TwoXChromosomes
"New Zealand approves paid leave after miscarriage, and encourages the world to follow | New Zealand will become one of the world's only countries to offer paid bereavement leave for workers who suffer a miscarriage, after lawmakers unanimously approved the motion on Wednesday",,1616678297.0,mepper,TwoXChromosomes
"Today, I could not have been more thankful to run into that ""annoying neighbour""","First time poster here ... To start this off right let me say that Mitch is not annoying, but there are times I just want to peacefully enjoy my walk with my dog, and really don't want to engage in conversation with anyone, and times I've been trapped in a conversation or two where all I want to do is escape. 

Well, this evening was a completely different story. I live in a condo complex that has 5 buildings. I was leaving the complex to walk my dog when I spotted a driver who had stopped and was staring at me. I thought nothing of it, kept walking as he drove away slowly and carried on getting off the property and to the park. Well, I get to the street, and sure enough the same car is sitting there, we make eye contact, he stares for a couple more seconds and drives away. By this point my guards are up, the way he looked me up and down sent chills up my spine. I keep walking down the street, main goal being to get inside the semi-busy park and surround myself with people, when sure enough this same car turns the corner back onto the street I'm walking down and I notice he begins to slow down. As soon as I saw him I thought, grab your phone and pretend you have a call. So I'm walking down the street, talking to myself and he drives by very slow and gives me that look again. Once he passed and I saw him turn back into my complex I hauled ass to the park where I stopped to gather my thoughts, and this is where Mitch came over. 

He came up to me, we did our usual hello's and he paused for a moment before he said ""I don't mean to intrude, but I noticed while you were walking, you kept looking over your shoulder a lot. Are you ok?"" At that moment I didn't know if I told him what was happening if he would think I was overreacting, or if he would understand why I felt scared. I explained what was happening, and without even batting an eye he said ""My pup and I would like to continue our walk with you, if you feel comfortable with that?"". Of course I said yes, and we carried on through the park. I felt my shoulders relax and knew I was safe. 

Once we got to the point where my walk would end he said ""Would you like me to walk you to your building (the farthest away) just to make sure everything is ok?"" My response was, nah I think I'm ok, what are the odds of him sticking around ... 2 seconds later, he pulls out of the complex again, and gives me the creepy stare before he drives off. At that point, without hesitation Mitch says ""Let's carry on"". As we are walking he so calmly says to me ""If I see that car again, I am going to gently take your hand in mine as if we are a couple, as long as you are ok with that? And if so I need you to do two things. Nod in agreement, and move your leash to your other hand so your hand closest to me is available"". I didn't have to think twice, I nodded as I moved the leash and we continued to walk and carry on conversation like nothing had happened. 

I got to my building's main entrance safely, and I didn't know what to say. I couldn't thank this man enough for being so protective of me, a woman he had only had a few interactions with here and there. It was then he took a few minutes to explain his background, and it made a lot more sense. He was an ex-Israeli soldier who left Israel when his Mom was constantly being abused by his Father and no one would help. He used all his money to move his Mom, little sister and their family dog to a safe place far away from his Father until he could join them. He said it was at that point, he decided he would do everything in his power to ensure women felt safe and secure, no matter the circumstances. 

I learned a lot tonight, and I feel like if it weren't for Mitch, something bad could have happened. I appreciated his soft, consensual approach to me, especially when he could see I was struggling and stressed. The world needs more men like Mitch.





***UPDATE: Firstly, OMG you guys. I have never felt soooo loved and heard from a group of strangers. Honestly you guys made my day. Waking up and seeing all of your responses, I couldn't help but cry. You are all an amazing group of humans and thank you again for the support 🩷

I went and filed a police report after work, with as much detail as I had, model of the car, colour, description of the guy. Sadly my brain went into panic mode and I did not get the license plate. I also notified the condo management company and they in turn have advised our security to be on the lookout. Again thank you everyone for all of your suggestions, and words of encouragement. 

Secondly, some of you are both hilarious and have very twisted minds lol. Trust me, this was not some creepy set up by Mitch. His reactions to me were very genuine, and I could not be more grateful for him and everything he did. 

Lastly, for those who are saying my title was mean or that I didn't appreciate Mitch by referring to the ""annoying neighbour"". I think I made it very clear that I DO NOT see him that way at all, and I am extremely, EXTREMELY grateful for his help last night. I cried when I got home before I posted this because I was so overwhelmed with his kindness and support. I kept asking him how I could pay him back, but he said there was no need. Just to stay safe, and come find him if I ever need his help. I'm sorry that out of my entire post, all you could focus on was the title. That really was not the point of me sharing.

Oh and really lastly lol I don't know if he's married/single/in a relationship 😂 he didn't mention this while we were walking and talking. Maybe I'll ask for a friend 😉",1688444977.0,HarleySin84,TwoXChromosomes
A man tried to kiss me outside a bar and pulled my hair to stop me from getting away.,"I was outside a bar with friends having a great time with a small group of guys. One of them was hitting on me all night and saying he wanted to kiss me but I was clear about being in a long term (10+ year) relationship. He managed to corner me when we were all outside smoking and grabbed my face to kiss me and when I turned around and walked away he balled all my hair(waist length) in a ball and yanked me towards him to try again. I managed to break free and put chairs between us.

When we all returned to the bar he tried to get me alone again but when I said no he yelled at me “What the fuck is wrong with you” I immediately wanted to leave and sobbed all the way home with my friends. 

I feel guilty for being nice to him. Is this my fault!? I feel like I’ve been assaulted. Have I been? Am I being overly dramatic? I feel so upset and violated right now.

Edit:

I feel like I should clarify some things. 

We are currently in a foreign country where people generally say not to trust the police. If I were in my home country I want to say I would have reacted differently but I felt completely and totally unsafe making a scene. He is gone from the resort today and unfortunately I do not have any of his information.

I was not with my SO because we are on an all girls trip.

No one really saw what he did since we smoked in a huge gazebo and I went to a corner to separate myself from the group since he was making me uncomfortable. Imagine a circle of people around a table talking and me behind them about 10 feet back in the dark. In hindsight I should have not separated myself from the group and vocalized my feelings towards him to my friends more outwardly. It’s was a horrible situation all around but I have learned from it. I will never ever enable someone like this to be alone with me again especially where they could easily follow me to my room and be ready to strike.

Also, thanks to everyone who is encouraging me to quit smoking. I did quit smoking in 2020 but I do have the scattered cigarette when on vacation.

As for the people who have commented on my mental health… yes I do struggle with mental health. How dare you take away from victims of abuse because they have mental health issues as if that changes the situation at all.

That’s all I really have to say. I think I’m still in shock today but I am so grateful for your support.",1681716625.0,JukeFlute,TwoXChromosomes
"Is it just me, or do you hate it when sex lasts a long time?","Growing up, TV and movies often referred to ""one minute men"" . Personally, I've never encountered a one minute man. However, I have been with a few ""one hour"" men. Let me tell you, it's awful. After enough time, I'm just wondering if he's not finishing earlier because I'm not attractive enough? After a bit, it starts to hurt, starts to feel like a chore. When it lasts too long, I'm sore and wrecked for a week in a way that is anything but sexy. 

Years ago, I asked one of my especially promiscuous gay friends about this, he said ""just look him in the eyes all sexy, and say, I want you to come"".
 I've tried this with a handful of men and it hasn't really worked. I brought this up with a promiscuous female friend of mine and she told me she starts to literally do a countdown to them, all dominant sexy like, ""I will count to ten and I want you to come.... 10.... 9.... 8....""
But, I wouldn't dare try that one! Not my style.

Some men, I've mentioned at times outside of sex how it would make me feel hot and desired if they came sooner. One guy I was with told me he always ""wants to come instantly"" but he goes into his head to stop this. I encouraged him that it would be better if he wasn't in his head and if he came quick that would be alright. After a lot of coaching, turned out his version of ""quick"" was maybe, maybe, ten minutes, which, to me, is perfect!

 I think a lot of men aren't actively within the moment with a new sexual partner. I think they have a lot of performance anxieties around lasting a long time. So, in the meanwhile, here we are sweaty body-to-body but he's in his head thinking about sports or whatever to make sure he doesn't come quick. That's awful. We are supposed to be having a shared experience here.

There are rare instances where I want it to last a long time. Those times are great. Us in it together. That's a version of sex that is great in the right time and place. However, most of the time, I feel like maybe ten minutes, fifteen is good. After that is when it can start to feel bad. Most of the time my internal organs can't handle a marathon. My stamina can't handle that either. 

A ""one minute man"" would be an honour, tbh. Would make me feel like I'm sexy as fuck. If intercourse makes him last only one minute, well, that's what foreplay is for. I think men have all the wrong ideas of what women like. 

But, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe not as many women have this issue as I do.

"I was assaulted on my first date ever after separating, and now I feel like every cliche of all time","I am sorry for posting this here. 

I am recently separated (very amicably) from my husband of five years. We have both supported each other in finding new partners and relationships. 

I finally decided to go on a date. I have never been on a ""real date"" in my life; any time I've ever sat down to dinner with someone, we already shared some kind of relationship. This man was incredibly smart, very kind, witty, etc. I was excited to meet with him. 

Dinner was lovely. Normal. Good conversation. We were flirting. I was having a good time, though I knew I didn't feel as attracted to him as I hoped, but being out of ""the game"" for so long, I assumed maybe I just didn't know what it really feel like any more. 

I am a sex ed teacher. We joked about some of the things my students have asked about. I told him one time I got an anonymous question that said, ""My girlfriend wants me to pull her hair but I don't want to mess it up. What do I do?"" We laughed and I said, ""I should have told the kid, Give the lady what she wants!"" I should not have said that. 

He lived across the street from the restaurant. After dinner, he said his roommates were going to watch the new Walking Dead, and did I want to join. I said I'd love to. 

We went to his apartment. Conspicuously no roommates but I didn't think too much of it. 

He gave me a tour. 

While I poked my head into his bedroom, he stood behind me. I make a comment about what looked like prayer flag he had. From behind, he grabbed my hair, hard. Harder than I've ever felt it be pulled. Hard enough that he pulled my head back and turned me completely around. He kissed me; I put my hand on his chest to push him. He pulled my face back by my hair, and without warning, hit me across the face with his other hand.

 ""Give the lady what she wants, right?"" 

And then hit me again, same side, same force. My head was ringing and I felt like my face was on fire. 

There is more, but I don't remember much clearly. All I remember is that he made me take his shoes off, and once they were off, I said, ""I'm going"" and I got up, and ran. He called after me saying, ""Wait! I'm sorry!"" but didn't chase me without his shoes. I still had my jacket on the entire time. 

(Edit: This is a lie; I do remember. I feel so ashamed I pretend that I don't, maybe in the hopes that I will actually forget, but I do remember, exactly. He forced me to give oral sex, and only stopped because I vomited on his shoes. The whole time he told me how beautiful I was and how good it felt. It lasted maybe 45 seconds)  
It's been a week. 

When I think about this, my cheek starts to hurt. Physically hurt.

I can't focus on my work; I am working on a PhD and all I want to do is sit in my bathtub and sleep. 

I told my sister an edited version. She offered to kill him. I told her, ""No no, don't do anything."" I have no idea why but the idea of escalating the situation at all, with anyone intervening or reporting it, sends me into a panic. 

I think he injured my neck and I need to see my PCP about it, but I am worried she will want more details of what happened. 

All the things I shouldn't have done: gone to his apartment. Not fought hard enough. Let him pull me to the ground by my hair. Not screamed. Not gone to the police. Not told any one. Gone on a date at all with someone i Just met on a dating site. 

This is not the place for this post, I know. I know, we get them all the time and this is just another chapter in our awful compendium of these experiences. But I haven't told anyone the full story and I had to. 




**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your kind comments. Please know I am reading them and taking time to sit with them and i hope to thank you all individually. I wanted to add a few things:

I have  since told another friend, this time I told her the entire story. I feel better knowing someone knows what happened. 

I am currently a PhD student so I get free counseling at my university. I have made an appointment and they offered me immediate services as well. I had to think about it but may call back and agree. 

I have no yet called my PCP (office closed for lunch now); I will tell the story but I am concerned about the injury being ""evidence"" because about a month ago I was in a car accident; I went to the ER and did not get diagnosed with anything other than ""neck and back pain."" I imagine this is really a re-aggravation of that injury, and it would be easy to argue that. I am not bruised or injured in any other way. All I have is the story; he has pages of texts of our very friendly, flirty conversation, witnesses of me having fun at the dinner, willingly leaving, and no reports of me immediately going to the police or ER or anything. 

I am 30 years old. I have a young son. I teach consent workshops, and dating violence workshops, and run a girls' group that is all about empowerment and resisting this kind of victim blaming culture. 

And yet here I am. Not immune. 


**Edit 2**: Thank you for those who have offered assistance via PM. I am trying to respond slowly. 

I have decided to speak to a female sergeant at our local police department who I have worked with professional on violence-prevention projects. I am going to ask for her insight as to what my options are and what the potential outcomes might be. This is about as much as I feel like I can handle at this point.

"If I was a man, then i’d be the man. Instead, i’m a “passive girly girl who smiles and does what she’s told”","Recently, the women’s empowerment committee at my company sent out the following email to over 100 employees recognizing me for receiving the “women’s empowerment” award of the month:

“At first look, she often comes across as a passive girly girl who just smiles and does what she’s told. Having worked with her for the past five years, I have seen her consistently perform at high levels. I see her as an example of how to maintain a pleasant and calm disposition, while also holding other team members accountable for their choices. So many disasters have been avoided because of her keen insight. As a man in the business place, I am ashamed to admit that she forced me to jettison many of the hidden biases pertaining to female coworkers.”

I was in absolute disbelief when I read that. Here were my general thoughts:

-Would they have written that about a man?

-Surely multiple people read this before it was sent out. Did no one think it was inappropriate?

-Who would write this about me? (It was sent anonymously)

I ended up figuring out who wrote it by looking up “keen insight” in my work chat search history and my so called friend/coworker used that phrase 4+ times in the past. He is also part of the women’s empowerment club.

He messaged me the day after it was sent out saying hi and I didn’t respond. Then he sent another message saying “what, so we’re just not friends anymore?”. I didn’t respond to that, so he deleted the message and sent another asking if everything was okay and to “like” his message if everything was fine and I was just busy. 

How is this okay? I am professional, friendly, and I do my job well. And it doesn’t matter because apparently all they see is a woman and all their “hidden biases” come out. He told on himself in that last sentence. It’s also gross because he has a woman as a direct report. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this?

"An old creepy loser made a comment about my butt and I finally got the courage to tell him off. Even better, his family was in the car with him.","To keep it short, my job requires me to deliver products via curbside to patients’ cars. 

A few days ago, I went out to his car to run his debit card and as I’m walking away I hear him say “Damn I like that ass.” I gave him a glare and ran back inside like a scared little girl, and I was too shocked to say anything to him. 

Thankfully my coworkers went out there and defended me saying that we are at the discretion to serve him if he continues to act like this. I stayed inside and watched him smirk as they pulled off pissed af I didn’t go out there and defend myself. Even his older son who was driving was yelling at him. 

Today, he came back, and gave me that same creepy smirk as I walked up to his car. There was a woman around the same age as him in the back and another young man driving, which I assumed was the rest of his family. I needed to defend myself because I was too shy to last time. 

I looked him in the eye and said, “{First name}, I need to say something about your comment last time you were here.  It was completely disrespectful and inappropriate and frankly very rude. You need to keep it to yourself, do you understand me?” I watched him sheepishly look at his wife in the backseat and say “yeah sorry” very quickly. I said, “ I hope you all have a great day” and walked away with my head held high. 

Even though it’s only a small thing, I feel a type of empowerment I haven’t felt before. I was proud of me, and I thought the other ladies here might too. Embarrassing an old creep in front of his family is a small victory in my book.

It's just hard. When I was younger I could let some of the hyper-sexualization slide, even in well-acclaimed ""good animes"" that still had their problems, but now its so hard.

 I feel like most anime is just irrevocably bad and so misogynistic it's not salvageable and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Even the most innocent characters are so sexualized.

Give girls great, life-affirming, wholesome characters! Like Nausicaä! Like Sophie in Howl's Moving Castle! Imagine another anime where the main character gets to dress simply and be an old lady for most of her screen time on top of it and it's lovely and self-empowering at the same time.

I feel like certain trends of modern feminism don’t exist to empower women- it’s just a repackaging of the male gaze.," Disclaimer: I’m not an expert in feminist theory, these are just my own observations and what I hear from other women both online and IRL. Please read before getting offended. Also, obligatory #notallmen because I know one of my points is going to get some people are going to fixate on a specific portion of this post. 

Why is a huge focus of modern feminism directed towards younger women coincidentally exactly what men want from us? There are some hugely important advancements in modern feminism, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve had a bone to pick with some of the trends I’ve been seeing. I’m not sure if this is completely mainstream, but it’s something I see being pushed to younger women ll the time, including myself. Here are a few examples I thought of: 


1. Empowerment through hperfixating on your looks. Don’t get me wrong, I like to express myself through my makeup and clothes. It’s fun. But it concerns me to see alot of women my age or younger treat physical appearance as the end all, be all. That CHOOSING to fixate on looks is inherently empowering because you chose it to be. I don’t care enough to tell women what they can and cannot find empowering, but it feels counterproductive to play into beauty standards and act like that shit is there to help women in any way, shape, or form. 

2. Empowerment through being an independent ~girlboss~. This might be my most controversial point. It’s great that women can choose whatever career they want (or not if they don’t want to), but I don’t see the same, intense push for men to uphold traditionally feminine roles. I’ve seen way too many men expect their future partners to essentially be a full-time house-maker while keeping a full-time work schedule. It doesn’t sound like there’s a split in workload, it just sounds like women are still expected to carry emotional labor on top of financial ones. It’s so fucking discouraging to see millennials or genZers behave like this. The more “progressive” men think they’re God’s gift to women because they do their own laundry which they somehow think is doing 50/50 on house work. Hopefully it’s simply an age/maturity thing. But all in all, the standards are definitely allowing men to take up some of these responsibilities, but it’s not at nearly the same rate as it changed for women.

3. Empowerment through porn. It really unnerves me how OF or sex work is marketed towards young girls as a fun and easy way to make quick cash. It’s always peppered with buzz words of “empowerment” and “taking control of your sexuality” and the people who push this idea clearly don’t give a shit about the well being of these girls. 

Maybe my observations are flawed or biased, who knows? Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, this is just something I needed to get out of my head

Why am I a bad person for not wanting to be sexualized for every little tiny thing?,"I don't understand why I get so much pushback from other feminists and women about this. 

Every little part of me, every little part of my body, every little interest I have or characteristic I harbor is sexualized in some form. My legs are sexualized, my shoulders, my stomach, my hobbies, my interests, my career. Everything just seen as another porn category or flavor of woman for the men's picking. I can't talk about my interests without ""that's so hot"" or ""men like that"". Can't have a career without it being expressed to me how attractive it is to men. Can't have a body without unsolicited comments and leering over just existing. 

And when I express this I always get yelled over about how I'm trying to control people's minds or that I am a puritan or something and it's so tiring. Yeah, I can't control people's thoughts, but how is it not bull crap to anyone else that women can't exist in any way that *isn't* relative to sex. Even if they're ""unattractive"" everyone focuses on the *absence* of sex appeal. And it is no secret that this incessant sexual ranking of women is used as a means to disrespect them.

I shouldn't have to overhear my male colleagues breaking down the sexual desirability of my female colleagues and talking about them as less-than because of it. I shouldn't have to worry about my voice and skills not ever mattering because people will look at me and only see me as a ranked list of sexual appeal. Its hard to see female political figures and professionals get pornified (even a young girl like Thunberg) as a means to dismiss them as a sex object that can't hold thoughts or power. I shouldn't have to see women get sexualized because men are *angry* at them and want to remind them they're things to be used. I shouldn't have to worry about men taking pictures of me or women I know to ""use"" later like I'm some species or thing that only exists for them.


It doesn't matter if there's women out there that find empowerment in sexualization. They are allowed to do that voluntarily with their consent. That doesn't mean that every single woman on this Earth should be looked at only through a pornographic lens. It doesn't matter even if these thoughts are kept to themselves if it still means they see women as lesser because they're always reducing them to sex in their heads.  A racist can keep racist thoughts in their head but they're still horrible feelings to harbor and possibly act upon. 

I'm not a bad person for not wanting to constantly be reduced to this in the gaze of men or even women. I don't know why this is controversial even in feminism and it makes me feel like I will never, ever be able to exist as anything other than a *thing* that represents sexual use.

Edit: This got more support than expected, so thank you to those who commented. It really helped my mental health. I felt alone with this concern. Let's all hope we can see the changes we want to be.",1633590775.0,Noooooo129746,TwoXChromosomes
"Favor:  Does anyone know of a video geared towards women and girls that is about personal empowerment, but not politically motivated?","I posted [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ME8sR-bnY) on facebook for the ladies, and I'm getting killed. I need another one that's not politically motivated, but more empowering to women.

The current arguments against the vid are abortion of course. After that, the right to medical checkups, and contraceptives is an argument to have those publicly funded. So it's not a right to them as if women are being denied, but the right to have everyone pay for them which of course goes against the conservative and libertarian mindset.

Anyone know of a video that is inspirational to women, but not politically motivated?  My target audience is mormon women, so when the politically liberal minded feminist agendas are shown, they shut down.   Baby steps for the indoctrinated, so if you want to be persistent, it won't help.  I did however like the parts of the video where women stand up for themselves, and don't want to be told what to do which is the sentiment I'm trying to convey.  Basically, in a nut shell, what I'm looking for is sexual freedom without shame, personal empowerment, loving ones self, and something inspirational.

I'm feeling horrid about an interaction I had this afternoon - I want to know how to handle these things better!,"This afternoon, I stopped at the local store to buy some chocolate for my sick boyfriend. They had a few good specials on (buy one get one free) so I decided I would buy him one of each of his favourite bars. That way, he can have something yummy today, tomorrow and maybe even the day after. I chose six bars in total.

As I threw them on the counter, a guy walks in and tells me to 'watch yourself, you're already on the far side of acceptable' and poked me in the stomach. I was floored. I did not know what to say. I am not okay with people that I know and love touching my stomach so this was a total violation of my personal space (not to mention the mental blow, that really hurt).

I just kinda stood there waiting for the cashier to ring everything up. The man continued though 'I guess some guys like a bit of meat on the bones though. I'd try anything once. What are you up to tonight?' I looked at him as boldly as I could and said 'taking these home to my boyfriend' he sniggered and quipped back 'sure you are sweetheart, whatever helps you sleep at night' and walked out of the shop. The cashier smirked. I took the bag and walked out. Didn't even make it past the front door before I'd burst into tears.

I, like most teenage girls, sometimes have insecurities about my body, but never have they all surfaced so quickly and on a day when I was otherwise feeling pretty damn good about myself. I feel sick, I can't stop crying and what is worse is that I wasn't even able to say or do anything to stop it.

This is one of the most inspirational communities I know, so I want you to share your stories of empowerment in situations where people have just been absolutely horrid.

I'm tired of dealing with misgynoir from men of my own race,"Ever since I was a kid I've always been masculatized by grown men of my own race and I'm sick of it. It's so dehumanizing. I've dealt with the same pattern as a kid. Some grown black man acting like I'm the same size and gender as he is when Im clearly a woman, they threaten me because I'm not kissing their ass or put their hands on me, and if they ever get confronted on the matter by someone else they'll lie and say I made them do it because I was starting drama with them first even though I don't even say anything to these men most of the time. I'm visibly black, darkskinned with kinky hair..I don't use the hair typing system anymore because I feel like it promotes colorism and racism. I feel like that makes matters worse because it seems like it gives colorist black men the green light to be rude as possible to me. 

I got tormented by a black male teacher when I was in high school and no one helped me. He hated me for whatever reason and when I got older and started going to practice after school hours he would come up with reasons to torment me. He would call me out in front of everyone, he pushed me, he made up some reason one day to throw everyone's stuff on the floor except his favorite ones and indirectly said it was my fault. 

A few days ago this black homeless man with barely any teeth acted like he wanted to fight me because my trash bag had a hole in it and I didn't realize. I live in homeless shelter and im just waiting to be placed into a permanent home. For whatever reason he was helping the maintaince people take out the trash so he saw my bag leaking, i apologized and was literally about to clean my mess up until he started making passive aggressive insults.

 When I defended myself he stood by the door trying to scare me..I called him a fucking idiot and started walking away. He said as I was walking away,"" say that again. I was in the army for x amount of years."" I cursed him out and said he wasn't going to do shit because he would've done it already. I had mace in my pocket but the fact that he was trying to scare me and thought it was a good look for him to try to scare a black woman is insane. I came back out with my mom and she said,"" stop talking to my daughter crazy."" He said he never said anything to me and that i started bothering him out of nowhere..i started screaming and making a scene, then he walked to his room saying he was going to get his sister to beat our asses. 

Before anyone in here comments that this is a poor person issue I've experienced this similar situation while being in middle class areas the school I went to where the black male teacher was tormenting me was in a middle class area. And I already have a feeling someone is going to say that poor areas have a high rate of violence so I should be expecting this..I have not seen any fight that broke in since I've been in a homeless shelter, and before someone else tells me I need to leave I know I'm leaving I'm just waiting to get permanently placed somewhere else. This wasn't about being in a poor area he was just very eager to do it because I'm a black woman. After that he came out to smile at the hispanic women in the hallway. After that I wanted to cry not because I was scared of him but because I'm I'm sick of being treated this way. 

No matter what I've worn I'm always been treated like a man from men my own race. I was more girly when I was in school and still got pushed and hit by black boys. They would try and justify it somehow all of the time while always leaving the hispanic or more exotic looking girls alone. I used to be all for black empowerment but honestly I'm not anymore. I'm sick of defending black men and boys but they turn around and want to try to break me down and treat me like shit. I've never experienced so much hatred from another group of men..even when I dealt with racist white men they have never tried to act like they were going to hit me.

 I'm sick of it..I'm so uncomfortable around my own race of men because of all the stuff they've done and tried to justify doing. I had gotten some help from a few black men but I've gotten way more hostility and anger from them as a collective. And every time a black man acts like he wants to hit me and I'm around other black men they just all stare and don't do shit about it, but later want to talk about being protecters and providers. I told my ex about it and he hasnt said anything (he's black) ,I asked if he was even going to ask if I was okay..no response. He's been texting me obviously wanting to have sex but you can't even pretend to care? 

I hope I'm allowed to post this here. I don't really know if I'm allowed because there's other races of women here. I hope this doesn't come across as hate speech. I just feel like misgynoir and violence against women within the black race isn't talked about enough even with these youtube channels I feel like these things aren't getting enough coverage or people just write us off as being bitter. And yes I got referred to a psycharist, but for anxiety. I'm scared of having ptsd on my record but I do think I may have it..I still think about the teacher that bullied me and it happened over 6 years ago.",1694384962.0,_HotMessExpress1,TwoXChromosomes
"My gynecologist bullied me into feeling like a broken woman, and then sent me home after doing no tests. Wtf.","I went to a gynecologist for the first time last Thursday. It was awful. I went in for painful erratic periods and allergies to period products. I'd waited *months* to see her. I was pretty jazzed to finally get some answers! My periods have been like this since I was 12, and I was *finally* going to get some answers.

I walked in, and waited for the doctor. In came the nursing student, whom the doctor legally has to ask my permission to have in the appointment with me. I was not given a choice, but I didn't protest because I always let them in anyway, it's good learning experience! Just would have been nice if they asked. I talked to the nursing student, she took notes, pretty standard: allergies, medications, height, weight, have I been pregnant, have I had any STIs, have I had any surgeries, do I have any physical health problems, any mental health problems, the usual, and I answered everything. The mental health portion took a while, cause it required some 'splainin. Then the doctor came in. 

Girl, when I tell you I still have no idea what the *fuck* happened, I mean it. She asked me all the same questions, fair enough, she wanted to make sure the student was thorough. We got to the mental health part, and GIRL WHEN I TELL YOU I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED, I MEAN IT. She asked for my diagnoses, I listed them off, including my PTSD. She asked what caused the PTSD. I get it, it's kinda relevant, I guess.. So I said sexual trauma. She said ""what sexual trauma"" I was kinda taken aback, sexual trauma is sexual trauma, do I really need to explain? But I figured she knows what she's doing, so I answered. I said ""multiple rapes and assaults, sex work, and childhood molestation."" Then ensued a fucking **hour** of promising her multiple times that I'm not in the industry anymore, and her lecturing the shit out of me.

She kept saying I must feel like a freak, and that I need to find friends like me. (Actually she said ""peeps"", but I'll rug sweep that like she rug swept me.) I told her I don't feel like a freak, I've come to terms with my past, and I know that my poor decisions came from hardship. I'm mostly at peace with it. I said that I've been in rehab twice, met people like me, befriended them, and as much as I love them, they're *still* not my best friends, because life is boring when everyone is the same. She said I'm isolating myself and need more ""peeps"". (What is with her and that word!) I straight up told her I have some very close friends, an amazing boyfriend, a hella supportive family, and I also have a trauma therapist whom my family *pays* to give me *professional* advice. She rugswept that little tidbit, and I wasn't being allowed to stand up for myself. I realize now, I could have just left, and didn't have to take this, but again, it was my first time at the gynecologist and I thought this must be normal. I'm mad that I didn't question, cause that's how you get fucked over, but, it happened the way it happened.

Basically, I'm just upset. The whole appointment was about my drug abuse and sex work from ***several years ago***, she kept trying to push me to go to AA and NA, and I said ""my addictions counselor willingly discharged me, and my rehab psychiatrist also ended our contact because I'm so fucking sober."" And she said ""so you manage your cravings on your own?"" And I said yes. She rugswept that in disbelief. She also for whatever reason couldn't use the word ""vulva"" around me? She kept referring to it as my ""bottom"". (Mostly just irks me, but I guess it's whatever....) It was unacceptably unprofessional the way she acted. But I was willing to put up with all of this, just so I could have some tests done. No tests were done.

She said ""do you shave your bottom?"" (Spoileezzzz she meant vulva.) I said ""yes"". This lady shook her head no for literally over 45 seconds and then said ""no honey. That's your problem, stop shaving. That's why your skin gets irritated with pads."" So I told her, no, we've been over this, I'm allergic to sweat, (did u even read my file?) pads create sweat, so I get a rash. And, funny enough, shaving doesn't give me rashes the rest of the time when I'm off my period, so what the hell are you talking about? I still got rashes before I started shaving, so what the hell are you talking about? (I was more civil about it though, obviously.) She kept saying ""I've never had a patient come to me where every part of her bottom has pain. Never."" *cue the awkward head shaking again, as if it solves anything*.

She suggested all of the things our moms tell us growing up about making periods easier, like, use lube if a tampon won't fit, etc. I told her I've tried them, she ignored it, and said ""try them, and stop shaving."" I said ""not trying to shoot down your ideas, but I'm not going to stop shaving. The hair irritates me. And I don't like the look of it."" Then came the body image issues assumptions and lectures. ""So you strike me as a very self-conscious person"" I said ""No, I have issues with my body, as does everyone. But when I don't like something about my body, I change it. If I can't change it myself, I get it tattooed or pierced. It's not insecurity, it's empowerment. I take charge of my appearance. Yes, I have some compulsions with my body. But I'm working on them, and I'm in a good place with them. She then asked me to show her my tattoos and piercings. I showed her *one*. Then she cut me off with another unwarranted body image lecture, (same one as before just worded differently) then finished it with ""but honey, you're still not comfortable in your own skin. Come back to see me in the new year. If you want me to be scarier, I will. Do you want me to be scarier?"" (Lady, please. Don't flatter yourself. I spent my 14 year old days getting into random guys cars, you may be a little ""tough"" by your standards, but you do not scare me.)

So, I would have been FINE with all of this, had she then said ""okay, get on the table. Time for some tests."" Or even ""are you cool with us doing some tests?"" But no. She said ""you know, you don't have to be ready for the speculum right now."" I chimed in with ""I am."" She said ""I have some patients that I see for years before doing an exam."" I said ""I don't want that."" She replied: ""some women I have to take into the OR to get the speculum in!"" I said ""look at my chart, you'll see I'm more than up to date on all my STI tests, they use a speculum for that, and I'm fine with it."" She didn't reply, and sent me home.

She even said multiple times ""I'm gonna give you some products to try, okay?"" Multiple times, and didn't. Y'all. I take good care of my vagina. I'm at the doctor ANY TIME anything happens down there that I can't fix with apple cider vinegar, a couple of days of going commando, and coconut oil on everything. I'm no stranger to speculums. No tests were done, the only thing she did was bully me into feeling like a broken woman for an hour, silence me when I tried to speak up for myself, and then when I refused to let her bully me, she sent me home. She did no tests, and sent me home feeling confused, and like shit. It's been a week, and my mental health has been rocked by this bitch. I've been self-conscious, crying a lot, and as you could easily guess, STILL IN A LOT OF VAGINAL/UTERINE PAIN. I get why she was trying to err on the side of caution with the trauma history, but in so many ways she was being so insensitive, why would she draw the sensitivity line in the sand at actually doing her job?!

*exhales*. Wtf. Bottom line, I am pretty emotionally healthy. I am not a child. I can handle the word vulva. I am not broken. And we are not 12 year old friends who just learned that we can shorten the word ""people"" to ""peeps"". (Jesus lord, I'm surprised she didn't turn her chair around backwards and straddle the back of the chair like ""cool teachers"" do, with all the r/fellowkids shit she was pulling.) I do not need to hear about your ""bastard ex husband"", and WE ARE GROWN UPS, SHUT UP AND LOOK AT MY VAGINA.

Tldr: went to the gynecologist, she picked me apart, bullied me, shit on my life choices, revictimized me with her stupid words, then sent me home, after doing no tests.

How do we reduce the burden of beauty standards?,"Sorry for my english, not a native speaker. Looking for a discussion/other opinions :)

Got me thinking after I saw this comment + the replier attacking every woman who had the slightest anti-consumerist/makeup opinion: [https://imgur.com/a/NYFSw2b](https://imgur.com/a/NYFSw2b)

When I was a teen, I had a ""not like other girls"" phase, mostly because girls were portrayed as shallow, unreasonable, annoying (for men/husbands), and sexualized caricatures everywhere. I think a lot of girls couldn't/didn't want to relate to that reduced image of themselves and had some misplaced hatred. I grew up in a DISGUSTINGLY sexist society + family, and that propelled me towards passionate feminism, intersectionality, and other societal issues that plague us both directly and behind the shadows.

Lately, I've been thinking more and more about the role women play in creating/upholding beauty standards. I guess I'm a bit late to the party?

I understand choice feminism to the degree where the choices are purely individual (to whatever capacity human nature allows). Beauty standards however are a bit of a hedgy topic for me. Yes, being objectively beautiful has societal benefits. Of course, anyone who decides to get work done isn't inherently a bad person or anything and this post isn't an attack. But to what extent do we chase these benefits? Women are conditioned to place more value on their appearance and mannerisms to seem desirable, \~93% of all cosmetic surgeries are undergone by women; but to a 19 Y/O me a few years ago, it seemed that the more we welcomed body positivity/dismantled those expectations, the more we should've strayed away from invasive surgeries (\*disclaimer at bottom) and increased representation of all features.

However, I believe we've taken a turn for the worse. I've seen so many influencers remove their minutely hooked nose to the template Instagram nose. Template Instagram lips. Template Instagram boobs. Removed a small beauty mark. Buccal fat. Parental pressure to get surgery in Asian households, not to mention the general beauty epidemic. Istg, the smallest of things. Body dysmorphia is ofc an issue, but what is the chain of causality, and are we okay being told: ""Why to learn to love yourself when you can fix it with money""? Heck, I've seen cosmetic labia surgery ads to make them look like Barbie crotches. At that point, we're not even chasing the epitome of natural beauty? And not to mention, the thriving $500bn makeup business is patronised disproportionately by women still. Add to that the age-old narrative of shaving, fair armpits, and youthism... however keeping in mind the difference between external grooming and internal structural modifications, I fear the normalisation and commonplace-hood of the latter poses a far bigger issue women seem to ignore with an ""it is my choice, it doesn't impact anyone else"" - but imo, it kinda does? Someday if it became a trend to bleach a-holes (as if p\*rn wasn't doing enough damage) it would eventually become a meme, a part of 'girlhood', and indirectly become another commonplace beauty standard. In the age of social media's fast-paced trends and sheer quantity, it doesn't take a lot to sway/influence people.

&#x200B;

In my head, purely ""aesthetic surgery"" choices don't exist in a vacuum. Every girl gets the clear message behind it. Insecurity is instilled, and girls are encouraged to roll over and give in and change every small thing they're taught is ugly, instead of creating a culture where surgery gets neither praise/encouragement or shame. Yes, influencers can be transparent over social media, but they can't carry a signboard saying ""I used to have hipdips! My lips aren't naturally wrinkle-less!"" Naturally, the erasure of certain features to replace them with ""prettier features"" over and over again creates a clear narrative that leads even more women to change themselves. In the end, we play into the same patriarchal standards in the name of empowerment.

""If you're broke, just say it"" - is beauty another thing we're relegating to the rich?

""Makeup/Procedures are one of the best things about being a girl!"" - Have we reclaimed this after eons of beauty standard imposition in an act of empowerment, or have we just become successfully indoctrinated?

To note: Makeup as a form of art, confidence, and enhancement is not something I'd ever want taken away from us. It's more about the glamourizing consumerist culture surrounding it.

Lastly, I've seen the recent surge of the Pick-Me Police that calls every woman a ""pick me"" for speaking against unattainable beauty standards, women's participation in patriarchal trends and not being yes-men jumping with supportive celebration at everything women do.

How are we going to watch and celebrate the goal post for beauty shift farther and farther while simultaneously preaching ""love yourself girlies!!"" to youngins without cheapening the sentiment? How do we end a cycle of falling prey to the standards? Is something like that even possible? Or in the end, is it just a game of who does it best and survives?

\*(I'm obv not referring to medically/functionally necessary cosmetic surgeries like botox for headaches, breast reductions, skin removal, etc. as I've seen people bring these up to eventually derail conversations. And if someone was born with features so sharp and unique that it deviates from the ""norm"" to the point where it affects their mental health, by all means, use medical science!)

Sometimes 2X makes me feel like I'm not an empowered woman because I care about how I look. Am I the only one who feels this way?,"I know lots of ladies will see the title and downvote me before they hear me out but hopeful someone understands. I just don't understand why wanting to wear make up or look pretty or not wanting to be overweight is a bad thing. I don't care that some people don't care about that stuff, so why am I a bad person for wanting to be pretty? Of course I don't think a girl needs fake tits or a dark tan or whatever to be beautiful...but if that's what someone likes and makes them feel good than what's the problem. and yes, I am still guilty of looking at a boob job and saying ""wtf was she thinking"" but...I bet she's thinking ""damn I look good""

just because a normal girl looks like a super model, doesn't mean she feel like one. And it doesn't make her a fake bitch. Lets be nicer:)


EDIT: thank you everybody for all your input. It's nice to know I'm not alone. And the big consensus I'm getting from all of you is that empowerment is all within the eye of the beholder <3",1315521968.0,LotusPuddle,TwoXChromosomes
"A Critical Reexamination of ""Baby Got Back""","Upon a cursory listen, ""Baby Got Back"" seems like an ode to objectification, reducing a woman's value down to the size (and, presumably, lushness) of her buttocks. And given the unfortunate prevalence of such misogynist objectifying in mainstream rap music, such a consideration might seem to make sense. 

But having heard the song the other day, I realized that the song is actually doing something much subtler and more impressive--reframing objectification as empowerment, an invitation to self-acceptance among women who might otherwise regard their bodies as inadequate for ""the male gaze."" 

I don't mean to imply that objectification itself is some kind of reverse-psychology feminist tool, and I resent justifications for such belittling acts as catcalling that often amount to, ""Just take it as a compliment and move on!"" There is a difference between commentary and harassment, and since at this point you'd probably have to seek out Sir Mix-A-Lot's song in order to hear it, I'm more inclined to put it in the former category. 

The song's introduction features two women (one of whom is named Becky) deriding a third girl, also unnamed (but who we'll refer to as Shaniqua, for convenience's sake). We hear our nubile Statler and Waldorf complain about the undue attention Becky receives from eligible bachelors:
 

> Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt.
>
>It is so big. *scoff* She looks like,
>
>one of those rap guys' girlfriends.
>
>But, you know, who understands those rap guys? *scoff*
>
>They only talk to her, because,
>
>she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
>
>I mean, her butt, is just so big.
>
>I can't believe it's just so round, it's like,
>
>out there, I mean - gross. Look!
>
>She's just so ... black!

Right away, Sir Mix-A-Lot has introduced several misogynist tropes in his ode to the derriere. The women insult Shaniqua for looking ""like a total prostitute,"" effectively dismissing the entire profession as nothing more than a trashy call for attention while also suggesting that prostitutes lack the agency to choose how to carry themselves. More damningly, Becky and her covetous companion imply that men befriend Shaniqua solely for her figure, which they proceed to call ""gross"" and ""black."" Thus, not only have Becky and her friend equated ""blackness"" with gauche lasciviousness; they've also reduced Shaniqua's worth to her body, thereby belittling her in the very misogynist ways they seek to criticize. Becky and her friend thus represent ""woman-on-woman hate,"" an internalized manifestation of the leering patriarchy and its Madonna-whore binary. 

>Oh baby, I wanna get with you
>
>And take your picture
>
>My homeboys tried to warn me
>
>But that butt you got makes me so horny
>
>Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
>
>You say you wanna get in my Benz?
>
>Well, use me, use me
>
>'Cause you ain't that average groupie

Before long, Sir Mix-A-Lot himself enters the fray. After declaring his initial love for ""big butts,"" he proceeds to address a hypothetically well-endowed female but doesn't fall back on the standard ""You want some fries with that shake?"" word-vomit that too many men still consider to be legitimate praise (or, at the very least, to be a non-harmful compliment of levity). 

No, Mix-A-Lot's passions run deeper than that. He expresses his wish to ""take your picture,"" perhaps alluding to the art world's historically consistent fascination with the female form. Mix-A-Lot thus places aesthetic--as opposed to sexual--value on the woman's ass, while still admitting that it ""makes me so horny."" Crucially, he doesn't pressure the woman into a sexual situation or assume that a woman with a big butt is ""asking for"" such attention; no, Mix-A-Lot's gaze is redirected in two more interesting ways.

The first way he does this is the most obvious: Sir Mix-A-Lot sublimates his gaze into song, participating in an artistic discourse about the nature of female sexuality since time immemorial. The second way he redirects his gaze is surprisingly self-flagellating; he actually invites the sort of ""gold-digging behavior"" so many other rappers deride, and he justifies this by pointing out that the object of his affection is not just an ""average groupie"" but rather someone special and worthy of Mix-A-Lot's charms (and/or wealth).

>I'm tired of magazines
>
>Sayin' flat butts are the thing
>
>Take the average black man and ask him that
>
>She gotta pack much back
>
>So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
>
>Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
>
>Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
>
>Shake that healthy butt!
>
>Baby got back!

Next, Mix-A-Lot engages in a bit of pointed media criticism, correctly pointing out that mainstream images of ""glamorous"" women (whom he later calls ""beanpole dames"") often praise dangerous thinness over healthy weight. He goes on to explain that the typical black male consumer is not swayed by such images and instead prizes ""that healthy butt,"" implying a confusion at the reason for such heavily endorsed thinness (e.g., ""thinspiration"") in the first place. And while his insistence that ""she gotta pack much back"" might at first read problematically, such seeming coercion is quickly mitigated by his suggestion that the male listener compliment his girlfriend's ""healthy butt."" The word choice seems crucial here; he values not a ""sexy ass"" or a ""bangin' behind"" but rather a ""healthy"" backside, thereby tastefully marrying notions of physical health with sexual attractiveness. How refreshing to hear a popular male rapper insist on such natural beauty. This media criticism is later echoed when he clarifies that he ""ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy, 'cause silicone parts are made for toys"" as well as in his famous proclamation: ""So Cosmo says you're fat. Well I ain't down with that!"" Mix-A-Lot clearly inhabits a space outside the traditional paradigm of female sexuality (and mainstream media representations thereof). More than that, he has cunningly packaged this alternative view of female sexuality in a very mainstream context: that of the ""party rap"" song. 

>I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal

Too often, the male gaze is established as a predator-prey relationship, but Mix-A-Lot here inverts that coupling and robs *himself* of agency. Instead of relying on the ""helpless female"" archetype, Mix-A-Lot renders himself powerless and almost feral in his appreciation of the healthy woman's figure. Never mind appearing uncouth; Mix-A-Lot injects his paean with disarming honesty, sidestepping the expected displays of bravado that male rappers fall back on to sell records as well as their own image. Mix-A-Lot is no Lothario; in fact, he seems willing to get played in the service of having closer contact with that all-important ass. As he puts it, he often finds himself happily ""begging for a piece of that bubble,"" leaving it up to the woman to decide whether to initiate sexual contact with him or not.

>So I'm lookin' at rock videos
>
>Knock-kneeded bimbos walkin' like hoes
>
>You can have them bimbos
>
>I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
>
>A word to the thick soul sisters, I wanna get with ya
>
>I won't cuss or hit ya

Here we see a vulgar critique of music television. Assuming that music video machinations are left to the discretion of the director and/or producer (as opposed to the extras that appear in the background during rousing party scenes or what have you), his ""bimbos"" dismissal reads less as a misogynist epithet and more as an expression of frustration with popular media representations of a female form that in Mix-A-Lot's view is both unhealthy and untenable. This is confirmed when he mentions that he ""won't cuss or hit ya,"" rejecting the culture of violence and disrespect that seems endemic to mainstream hip-hop culture.

>A lot of simps won't like this song
>
>'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
>
>And I'd rather stay and play [...]
>
>Some brothers wanna play that ""hard"" role
>
>And tell you that the butt ain't gold
>
>So they toss it and leave it
>
>And I pull up quick to retrieve it [...]
>
>He had game but he chose to hit 'em
>
>And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

Once again, Mix-A-Lot highlights the differences between himself and the typically pig-headed mainstream male rapper. But these lines stand out not just for this self-examination of identity but also for their encouragement of fidelity. One can't imagine Mix-A-Lot abandoning a healthy woman after having sex with her; no, he would ""rather stay and play."" They also serve as further repudiation of the violence assumed in too many hip-hop lyrics. Sir Mix-A-Lot advocates peaceful canoodling, for which he ought to be praised. 

******************

In sum, we can see that with ""Baby Got Back,"" Sir Mix-A-Lot has not added to the misogynist and patriarchal discourse of mainstream American media but rather rejected it, instead opting to stand in deference to full-bodied women with the agency to decide whether or not to go home with Mix-A-Lot. As a reversal of typical power structures in the American rap mainstream, ""Baby Got Back"" deserves consideration as a feminist anthem from an unexpected source while serving as proof that even the biggest of butts must never trump common decency.

Does anyone else actually really like pink?,"I keep coming across all these posts on 2XC remarking on how the pink princess phase erodes female empowerment and all, and the comments on those posts usually seem to agree with those sentiments. 

I grew up with three older brothers, almost everything I owned was pink, I had such a collection of Barbies and other dolls, and I often ran around the house in a princess costume. (I even dragged my parents into seeing the Disney Princesses on Ice show in rebellion against my upcoming 20th birthday.) But somehow, I've ended up in college studying physics and chemical engineering and engaging in all sorts of male-dominated activities.

I feel like it's not a popular sentiment to have on 2XC, that pink is not the problem. Thoughts? Anyone else agree with me on this? :/

**Update** Wow, I did not expect such a flood of comments-- especially not so many posts agreeing with me! I've been on 2XC for a while now, and like I mentioned, I've seen a lot of anger towards the color: pink toolsets, pink computers, pink or princess themes (including here on the 2X page)-- they've all seemed to elicit negative responses from this community. And I understand that sometimes it seems like pink is the only option girls are ever given, but I don't feel that the lashing out against the color as a symbol is justified.

Why do a lot of men on the internet treat the word “feminism” as a grave insult,"I feel like many of them use it in the same way that people who don’t like Andrew Tate use the phrase “Andrew Tate supporter.” Like these types of guys use feminist as a degrading insult or at least treat it like one. Why? I know there are bad parts of the movement/concept but, in my experience, those parts tend to reside online where people can get lost in echo chambers and form extreme views, both conservative and liberal. And especially compared to Tate, feminism is wayyy less extreme. Like at least feminism helps people out. What the hell is Tate doing? Scamming people? Trafficking girls? “Crazy feminists” exist but at least they’re not committing serious crimes.

Another thing I’ve noticed is that even if something isn’t inherently feminist, ie literally just a woman existing, they’ll call it feminist and insult it. Ex. just watched a cute instagram edit about shows with female main characters, and there were dudes in the comments saying they’ll never watch them because its “women empowerment”.., lol

Also to clarify: the Andrew Tate thing isn’t something I saw online, like I didn’t see anyone saying that compared to feminism Andrew Tate is rational or vice versa. It was just a comparison I thought made sense as I’ve seen both terms (“Tate fan” and “feminist”) being used to describe and insult men and women respectively.",1683957480.0,madameruffruff,TwoXChromosomes
Liberal Feminism Has Failed Us. Now What?,"
Feminism used to be a bad word. The reigning F-word from the 1960s until the late 80s, the mere mention of it invoked images of radical, deafening demands and cardboard slogans, feral women who'd gotten out of the yard and all the way to the steps of the capitol, wrapping angry jaws around the neck of the nation and refusing to let go until they’d won the right to control their bodies, their lives, and their futures. 

They handed us a better world, and less than fifty years later we let it slip through our fingers. 

By the mid 1990s feminism had been defanged, given a makeover, and lobotomized. Political structures and direct action were viewed as unladylike relics wielded by nasty women. You know the type. Always unsatisfied, too serious, too certain, always too much. But this new feminism would not be like that *other* feminism, these girls not like those *other* girls. The new feminism would be one of individual expression, of sex positivity and girl ‘power’, bumper sticker platitudes and lipgloss apathy. 

The new feminism arrived, and it was pink, and stupid. It was a movement even a man could love. And man, they did.

What wasn’t to love? These feminists weren’t those angry radicals; these women were fun. Agreeable. The modern feminist didn't waste time shouting or making demands, she was too busy making herself pleasant to look at, her makeup on point, her clothing sending a clear message that her body was no longer the private property of any one man. Now, she was open to the public.

But for many women something felt off. If the sexualized sideshow of 'empowerment' was the best that modern feminism had to offer them, why not see what the other side—the Devil-They-Knew—was selling, instead.

Every minority group has its traitors. Vile unbelievers who lie down with dogs and forgive them their fleas. Women especially do this in droves, choosing to join or ally with the right wing, to marry into a traditional home and lifestyle. Worse, they utterly despise women on the left, going to great lengths to become vocal, useful idiots for their male oppressors, attacking and vilifying any version of womanhood that steps beyond male-defined boundaries. 

It’s not your imagination—today we see more women choosing this life than at any other point over the last 30 years, and in the days since Roe's death they are more visible than ever. We see them on the news, on our social media feeds, almost everywhere we look. Women of all ages—most distressing are those in their late teens and early 20s—celebrating  the return to traditional values. We watch, stunned, as they welcome the theft of their own bodily autonomy. It is a baffling spectacle to most women. The shouting. The cheering. We look and we wince and we look again. We ask ourselves—we ask each other, we ask the heavens: What in the hell is she *doing?*

We tell ourselves that she has been brainwashed—by religion, surely, or by some controlling male relative, or by right-wing media. We tell ourselves that she would not and could not possibly chosen this life of her rational own free will. We tell ourselves this, and we are usually wrong. 

Andrea Dworkin explained it plainly in 1983:

*Right-wing women face reality and what they see is that women get fucked whether they want it or not; right-wing women, at least, get fucked by fewer men. She conforms, in order to be as safe as she can be. Sometimes it is a lethargic conformity, in which case male demands slowly close in on her...Sometimes it is a militant conformity. She will save herself by proving that she is loyal, obedient, useful, even fanatic in the service of the men around her.*

*Right-wing women accuse feminists of hypocrisy and cruelty in advocating legal abortion because, as they see it, legal abortion makes them accessible fucks without consequence to men. In their view, pregnancy is the only consequence of sex that makes men accountable to women for what men do to women.*

*The tragedy is that women so committed to survival cannot recognize that they are committing suicide.*

	—-*Right Women Women*

Far from advocating for the right-wing viewpoint, Dworkin illustrates that liberal feminism does not sufficiently account for many women's lived-reality, and that some women decide—quite rationally— to suffer a more reliable sort of oppression at the hands of the right-wing. Liberal feminism has failed the woman in your Twitter feed wearing a MAGA hat just as much as it has failed you. But she, at least, admits it. 

We can admit it, too. And we can decide to replace the feminism that failed us with a better one, maybe even an older one. The kind of feminism that gets results, and doesn't give a damn about looking pretty in the process.

Radical feminism died with the 80s. It wasn’t a dignified death, the movement unable to control its own momentum, arms flailing as it landed face-first under the weight of its own imperfections, leaving behind a jagged, bloody streak of victories that were vital to women's rights: chief among them, the achievement of reproductive freedom in 1973. 

But any mention of radical feminism today prompts discourse not of its accomplishments, but only its flaws: the movement was too white, too wealthy, too cisgender, too exclusive. All of this is true. And this already-lousy image is made worse by the periodic attempts to re-animate its remains by various hate groups—primarily those interested in glossing over their disgust of the transgender community with an academic coat of paint (That many radical feminists were inclusive of trans people is merely an inconvenient footnote for these hateful flunkies). Perhaps the most frequently-cited criticism of radical feminism is its lack of intersectionality, and to be sure the importance of a broader perspective cannot be overstated. 

But while liberal feminism fixated on how best to expand the forest, radical feminism at least understood that the trees were on fire. Liberal feminism promised eventual equality from oppression, but only as long as the rules were followed to the letter; no individual must ever feel excluded; no one must ever feel invalidated even for a moment; all voices and all issues must be equally considered and prioritized at all times and in every circumstance, regardless of whether or not any action or progress ever occurs; and the most important rule of all: women must keep themselves neatly arranged within the system designed by—and entirely for—their oppressors. 

Radical feminists knew better than to ask for equality; they demanded liberation, for themselves and for their daughters. Intersectionality can and must be a pillar of feminism going forward. But how much worse will our lives have to become before we accept that a movement forced to be everything to everyone will ultimately never accomplish anything for anyone?

Perhaps there's still something to learn from radical feminism—that we can politically organize around what we have in common, and make separate time to focus on the needs that make us unique; to take the good while leaving behind the bad; to learn from the old and empower the new, and to revive the demand for nothing less than liberation. Radical feminism showed us that no matter how hard any man works to scrub away all traces of your life and your experiences, he’s going to miss a spot. They always do. 

## 

Our oppressors dread the thought of us returning to the radical, embracing the tactics that have worked before. They fear what feminism would look like if we brought back its teeth, its muscle, and its memory. 

Here’s exactly what it would look like: They desperately want us to think we're helpless; we won't believe them. They hope we'll let our reproductive freedoms fade into distant memory; we won't allow it. They'll continue to bombard our senses with lies and horror and distractions because our despair and our cynicism feeds their cruelty; starting now, we'll let them starve. 

Abortion access was the single greatest accomplishment in the fight for women’s rights—a generous inheritance from the feminists of yesterday, in all their impatient, imperfect, and radical glory.

Patriarchal religions,"Ever since I've been on reddit and other feminist forums, I've been super into feminism and female empowerment. Religion plays a big role in patriarchy and conditioning women to accept it, imo. I grew up Mormon as a child, and your a young child, and your told by your primary teacher what a women's role is. In mormonism, in order to go to the celestial kingdom which is like the highest Mormon heaven, you have to be married to a worthy priesthood holder, you are highly encouraged to be a sahm and have many babies. Your basically brainwashed to accept a certain role in life, because you're born female. And I feel that girls and women deserve to be able to make an informed choice, not to be shoehorned into a certain way of living. Luckily, I was not able to be successfully brainwashed or indoctrinated, because mormonism never jived with my inherently independent, care free, and free thinking nature. I just realized religion is bullshit at a very young age. I'm sorry if this topic has been beaten to death, I just wanted to share my perspective.",1691724628.0,Available-Level-6280,TwoXChromosomes
"I'm tired of us ignoring some of the genuine reasons many women get STIs that have nothing to do with being ""dumb"" or ""careless""","This is kind of a rant, but I'm seeing a pattern of STIs in women with male partners that I feel like we don't talk about or acknowledge.

I work in sexual health. So I see a ton of people in my clinic with STIs. Many women with male sex partners do not come in with STIs bc the are ""careless"" or ""dumb"" or ""slutty"". In fact, women with a higher number of sexual partners, often take sexual health more seriously than others. Sex workers, highkey have the best safe sex practices.

I feel like we are dishonest about what is really fueling so many of the STIs in women with male partners. SOOOO many of the women I see felt uncomfortable forcing a man to get an STI test before sleeping with him. Or they believed a man verbally saying he was tested, instead of demanding official paperwork (shocker some men lie about their results or when they got tested). some women were too scared or uncomfortable to demand a man use a condom.

(I have literally had to teach teen girls how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms because none of their sex-ed teachers ever bothered to mention that critical aspect of sexual health to them.)

The vast majority of my HIV positive women I see got it from a monogamous partner who either cheated on them or withheld their HIV positive status from them.  I just had a woman get HIV from the only man she'd been with for the past five years and I just feel bad because she did nothing wrong and it never occurred to her she'd be at risk - but women in monogamous relationships still have STI risks. I've seen married women discover they had an STI because they were struggling with getting pregnant, but hadn't got an STI test since the start of their relationship, and their male partner had unfortunately been unfaithful to them at some point. (Fun fact some STIs are silent killers, you can't necessarily ""feel"" every STI)

I feel like we just tell women ""use condoms"" and ""get tested"" for safe sex, but that's literally scratching the surface because it doesn't acknowledge many of the genuine cases that cause so many women to not feel educated  or strong or confident or comfortable enough to press for safe sex in risky situations. 

Why aren't we teaching hetero women how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms? To say no to men who refuse to get up-to-date STI testing (no a test from 6 months isn't good enough)? That's its not being untrusting to demand to see STI results in official paperwork and not accept word of mouth? To know that sadly infidelity happens so even in monogamous relationships/marriage you still need to get STI tested yearly with your doctor? To tell their male partners that if they ever are unfaithful to tell you ASAP to get tested to prevent possible health risks? 

I just feel like we aren't being honest about the education and empowerment needed to actually help women practice safer sex - because giving free condoms is not enough to stop women from getting STIs.

P.S. I'm not trying to be heternormative, it's just the vast majority of women I see with STIs are having sex with men",1613263633.0,EziEzi95,TwoXChromosomes
"How can I learn to be more... comfortable with being a ""woman""?","I feel like this is a really weird question...

I'm a girl in my mid 20s who's never quite felt comfortable with being a ""woman"". Even before I was born, the doctor thought I was a boy. I wasn't, but I got teased endlessly for being really tall and broad (I'm 6'0-6'1 now).

For a long time, I was one of those teens who was like, ""Oh I'm a *cool smart gamer girl*, not like *THOSE* kind of girls."" I thankfully grew out of that awful phase, but never have felt comfortable being thought of as a ""woman"". (Probably why I refer to myself as a girl a lot.)

The first time I got my period (I was 10), my mom cried and told me I was becoming a woman and I wanted to just flippin' **die**. The thought of that day still kind of revolts me, how weird.

Typical expectations of ""what women are supposed to be"" cause me extreme distress. I don't like when people expect me to want to maintain my body in a particular way. Being hit on by other people causes me to get so flustered too, I can't understand why someone would see me in a way that would cause them attraction! (And I mean, I'm in a 5 year relationship and I still feel embarrassed, and I'm not a prude!)

I tried to expand my views on what being a ""woman"" is like, but still find myself coming up against a lot of issues. Like, I'm tokophobic (pregnancy phobia), childfree, and I find a lot of ""women empowerment"" comes from this idea that women are amAZINg for being able to have kids.

Now my question: I've explored my gender identity a bit, and want to be more comfortable with being **my** version of a woman. I want to feel more in tune with my ""sensuality"", and less awkward about my body not being ""typically feminine"".

Creating Empowering Spaces For Women,"Hi, girls! I am currently working on two separate communities for women. I would like to both introduce the concepts for them as well as ask for support in creating them. If you'd like to contribute or are interested in joining, please get in touch. Find detailed info further down in this post.

In addition, I encourage you to share any content on women's empowerment that you'd like to recommend in the comments below. That could be movies, series, music or books featuring strong female perspectives, your favourite female artists or public figures, relevant blogs or articles, your personal uplifting message to the women of this subreddit or whatever else seems relevant to the theme.


**About the online spaces I'm creating**

1st Community: 

A non-politicised, uplifting safe space for women. No hate, no drama, just sisterhood and good vibes. This is all about having a place to come to where everything isn't filtered through the male gaze. If you would like to contribute or be part of it in any way, let me know.


2nd Community: 

Everything mentioned above and more.
I am looking for some fellow girls to help me build an online space for female empowerment. A place where we can collect and share resources for our revolutionary sisters, our ambitious sisters building careers, our sisters who are victims of sexual harassment and assault and so many others. I believe that we can recognise and overcome a great deal of the oppression we are subjected to every day, if we get together, share our experiences and actively encourage each other to advocate for ourselves. Just having a place where you can speak out and be heard can be empowering, and places like this subreddit are an excellent start. I am looking to take it a step further, to connect young women who want to be a driving force in social change, by educating themselves and others on ways to defy misogyny, thrive in a world that doesn't treat us like people, share tips on how to be independent in a society that pays us less and denies us equal job opportunities. The objective is to build a network of women supporting each other in education, career and life. I would specifically like to hear from you if you are in your twenties or thirties, as I am in my late twenties myself. I am studying international relations at a European university, so if you have a similar academic background, we have another thing in common, but that is by no means a requirement. Please get in touch, if anything you read here resonates with you and you'd like to chat about it further.

The implication of makeup,"I get that girls and women have been wearing makeup since antiquity and won't be stopping any time soon because they feel it gives them an aesthetic edge.

But I just saw a ""celebrities without makeup"" photo series, where most had no makeup and used no filters and it made me think of how society's idea of what a woman should look like is so far from natural compared to society's idea of what a man should look like, and how this plays in to the self esteem of girls, or lack there of, by sending them the message that there is something inherently wrong with how they look by virtue of the fact that they are female and they must fix it with makeup to be socially acceptable.

When boys and girls are young, it's ok for them to just get out of bed and put on their clothes, but when a girl hits puberty and starts to comes of age, this becomes no longer acceptable. Suddenly, to be considered socially acceptable in society, she must make herself look unnatural and her natural body becomes something to be embarrassed about. She must wear a bra, shave her legs, armpits, and sometimes other places, wear makeup, and she is endlessly judged for her appearence, often above all other things, and it's about this time that a girl's self esteem begins to plummet.

Girls aren't born with the inherent sense that something is wrong with their bodies. This idea that the female body is inherently something to be ashamed of in it's natural state is drilled in to them by society, with their mothers often out front with the bullhorn.

I don't care how many books about ""girl power"" or female empowerment you buy your little girl. It's not going to offset the realities she observes and is subjected to in her everyday life that communicate to her that she is not acceptable in her natural state.

We talk a lot in the west about muslim women and how oppressive it seems to us that in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan that they must cover their faces with a veil. How in their society, it is shameful and embarrassing for a woman to show her face in public, while overlooking the fact that the west also requires women to veil, but in the west, the veils are makeup.",1552897405.0,PurpleFlame8,TwoXChromosomes
"To my fellow punkers/riot grrrls/music fans, what is your opinion of this song?","I love and appreciate the riot grrrl movement in the 90's(punk in general except nazi shit) and this song came out in 2018 long after the movement. I love the classic punk sound of this song and I creditted it as a nod to feminism in punk, but I looked it up on reddit and some people interpreted this as to make fun of riot grrrls and shit on them. I dont feel that way at all. What do you guys think?

Lyrics

*I wish I was a riot grrrl, a riot grrrl punk
Fighting for equality and smearing all the chumps
Across the walls of the local clubs
Fueled by feminism and hard drugs
I like to talk politics I like to strike fear
In all of the oppressed men that'd stand in my way
I'm not your plaything
I'm a motherfucking queen because who needs a king
I wish I was a riot grrrl, feminazi punk
Not your average ordinary day job girl
I won't take your abuse
Quit acting like a bitch and making up excuses
Girl, hanging with Bikini Kill
Female empowerment fills up the room I'm in
A never ending movement
All of these things make me wish I was a riot grrrl
I wish I was a riot grrrl, that would be cool
Taking what you know and breaking all the rules
Screaming in your face till your ears get tender
Teaching you a thing about race and gender
I'd like to kick your ass
Yeah that sounds fair
Hiding my brutality behind dyed hair
Men with guitars they don't know shit
And if they wanna talk shit they can meet me in the pit
Girl, hanging with Bratmobile
If I can't hit those high notes, I'll just squeal them
Into the crowd, its where I belong
Undercover feminine punk rock
Called riot grrrl*",1679777788.0,SullenSparrow,TwoXChromosomes
Sexist stuff really upsets me and i don't know what to do about it,"I don't even know why i am posting this but i just need somewhere to vent. 

I constantly come across sexist stuff on social media (instagram/reddit) and it's really been affecting my mood lately. Since i have a lot of time on my hands because of lockdown, i have been on social media a little too much lately because i have nothing else to do and i am really tired of the sexost comments that are literally everywhere. 

For example, just 10 mins ago i came across this subreddit for women and saw this post that had a link to a youtube video. The video was titled, ""What is the role of women."" The cover page had the words, 'Fuck the war out of men'. That was enough to stop me from watching the video, specially since the youtube comments were extremely sexist as well. That basically completely ruined my mood, which is why i am writing this post. 

I am so done with having my gender thrown in my face on the internet all the time. Its the, 'She looks like a man', comment about a muscular women and the 'Boys are stronger than girls' comments that upset me the most. I know my gender is weaker and has more disadvantages when it comes to strength, and i am really unhappy with that already. The last thing i want is to have it rubbed in my face. Specially because it's so stupid, i know how strong women are and how much shit we have to deal with on a regular basis. I don't even know where i am going with this post, i am angry, i am tired and i don't know what to do. 

I have considered quitting social media but i have nothing else to do and in the strangest way now, and i know this is going to sound crazy, i kind of look for the sexist comments on posts about women empowerment, just so that i can see somebody shut them down. And most times i am disappointed because a lot of people are apparently sexist, especially on the internet. 

I feel so pathetic even writing this. A part of me just wants to delete all of my social media accounts and not have to face the sexism. Anyways, i just needed somwhere to vent it all out.",1597922367.0,orangecreamcookie,TwoXChromosomes
What do you think of the movie White Chicks,"Honestly, when I first watched it back in December 2022, and I was blown away by the empowerment of the supporting characters in some of the scenes.

E.g:- that one guy pretending to be a girl said ""don't you think it's wrong that they're auctioning women off to random men (or something like that)"". I was like AAWW. That scene was heartwarming to me.

E.g:- latrell:- and for the lady....perhaps a salad
White chick:- perhaps not (and proceeds to order chips, chicken, onions, sauces and other stuff too)

E.g:- the dance off at the party. The 2 guys didn't have to as they were on duty and undercover, but they decided to dance anyways and help the girls win.

E.g:- White Chick:- maybe you're making yourself too available.
And I LOVED IT when the White Chicks helped the girl by telling her that she doesn't need to put so much efforts to make her crush like her. The ending, I was expecting the girl to feel guilty and apologize to her crush. But I was happy shocked when she told him that she doesn't need change for him and isn't worthy in her life and punched him in the face. 

I thought since it was an early 00s movie, it would be like a typical romcom or something, (e.g:- twilight and hallmark movies). 
And I only watched White Chicks because it had Terry crews in it (from Everybody Hates Chris) and I was bored and I needed a movie to be on the TV since netflix got rid of the good one. But the EMPOWERMENT of the characters won my heart, so it became my favourite movie ever since !!!!

What are your opinions on the film White Chicks ??",1675899654.0,Electrical_Touch_379,TwoXChromosomes
I’m a women’s rights activist who’s working with women and girls impacted by Trump’s Global Gag Rule. I just got back from Kenya. AMA!,"Hey 2XC,

On May 15, the Trump administration expanded the Global Gag Rule (GGR), a policy that withholds American funding from NGOs worldwide that provide or even talk about abortion. Trump’s version threatens more than $8.8 billion of foreign aid for women’s health (for comparison’s sake, the Bush administration’s version of the GGR affected only about $520 million in aid). Years of progress on women’s health in developing countries are at risk.

Since Trump’s announcement, hundreds of health clinics in developing countries are in the process of closing their doors. These clinics in Africa also are critical in treating AIDS, malaria, Ebola, and other tropical diseases. There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind when I say that the GGR is a death warrant for some of the world’s most vulnerable women and girls. 

A few months ago with Population Connection Action Fund, I visited health clinics in Kenya, the Congo, and Somalia that are being affected by the utter lack of support for reproductive health care. We went to hear directly from the women targeted by Trump’s death-warrant policies, with the goal of exposing them for what they are: atrocities Trump is committing against women, girls, and children around the world. I interviewed women and girls of all ages: from mothers with 12 children who desperately want to stop becoming pregnant, to teenage rape survivors living as sex workers in Kibera, an infamous slum in Kenya. 

I’ll be back at 8 pm ET to answer any questions you have about my experience and what I learned from these incredible women I met in Africa.

In the meantime, you can watch a couple of my interviews in Kenya here: https://www.facebook.com/PopConnectAction/videos/10154524263823602/

I hate how people assume my success in life as a female,"About a year ago i was really anxious about me not succeeding in life and failing school or not finding a job etc 

So i went to my father to vent and i was almost in tears and i told him about my fear and he said 

“Its okay sweetie you’re a girl the only thing you should care about is finding a good man and building a happy family

All you see on social media about female empowerment is fake and theres a study that shows females are much happier when they have children so don’t worry about anything else you’re a pretty girl sure you’ll find your place in society”

Dont get me wrong i love my father and i can’t blame him for his beliefs he’s an old man ofc he would think thats my real success in life but i hate it when people assume im just a baby machine 

Like damn I didn’t get in collage just to breastfeed my children and see them grow up 

And i get why he told me all that just to comfort me but it’s really devastating 

Back then i was annoyed now i dont care cause i might find happiness with building a family yeah but that doesn’t mean thats my only purpose 

And i hope i can find females/women/girls that can relate to what im feeling",1652047128.0,OptimisticGod,TwoXChromosomes
it is a too common experience for women feel disconnected from their own womanhood.,"*(Necessary disclaimer: I am discussing this is the context of cis and trans women.  Discussions about how women may feel alienated from their gender identity as a result of patriarchy should not, under any circumstances, be misconstrued as a way to invalidate AFAB non-binary people and trans men. TERFs are not feminist allies.  The policing of gender, such as by TERFs, contributes to the problems I seek to fix. I would also love to hear from the perspective of AFAB trans people and trans men if they would like to contribute as well.)*

Something I've come to recognize is that almost all women, at some point in their life, come to feel disconnected from their own womanhood or even dissociated from their bodies.  Being a woman in under patriarchy is brutally difficult,  discouraging, and disenfranchising.  On the face of it we have to deal with the constant harassment because of our bodies, being spoken over or treated as less capable on account of our gender, denied access and opportunity based on our presentation, and so much more.  But it's worse then that.

As girls grow into women and throughout their lives, we go through life being are bombarded with constant, self-reinforcing messages on what it supposedly means to be a woman.  We are given expectations of who women are, what is expected of us, and what being a woman means. Much of this revolves around the objectification of women's bodies.  This is omnipresent in the media we consume, the conversations we have, and in the way we are treated by men.  This disempowering objectification and sexualization is often placed upon us at a disturbingly young age. Most women I've talked to experienced being cat called or harassed by the time they were twelve, and often much earlier.  We are told by our parents, our friends, our television, and our teachers that our bodies are sinful and wrong, but also that it exist for the pleasure of others.  There is an ever expanding and often contradictory list of how we are supposed to look and behave.  This can lead to the feeling that our bodies do not belong to us, that they are foreign or alien.  Many women even grow resentful of their bodies and the unwanted attention and abuse it brings.  As if this wasn't enough, we are even alienated from our very connection to womanhood and female identity itself.

Women are told we are strong, but also need to be submissive.  That we should be assertive, but polite. Physically attractive, yet modest and not vain. Sexually experienced, yet pure with our virginity intact. When we grow up being told that this contradictory and impossible list is what it means to be a woman; that this is the *only* correct way to be a woman, is something that most women will internalize and struggle with throughout their life. As we grow and realize that we cannot fit this one-size-fits-all mold, we become disenfranchised from our gender identity or sex. This is commonly seen in the ""I'm not like other girls"" mentality, which many young women go through at one point in their lives. When there is this conflict between our lives realities as a woman, and what we've internalized womanhood to mean, its easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the problem is with us.

These pressures are amplified for trans women, gender non-conforming women, lesbians and BIPOC.  As limiting as the expectations of womanhood are on all women, they are also geared towards feminine, cisgender and heterosexual white women.  Historically and presently these groups of women were often excluded from female spaces and consideration, even in early feminist movements.  It reinforces a view of womanhood that excludes these groups based on who they are, and often quite literally being equivocated with men.  To the women belonging in these groups, this can not only make them feel disconnected from our own female identity, but also other women. 

At some point in most women's lives, this contradiction between their gender and identity has to be confronted.   It's unfortunate that many fall into the trap of thinking that this means that they have somehow failed womanhood, or that they do not belong or relate with other women.  We are trained to think we are the ones who are broken, not the society we live in.  I don't think it's a stretch to argue that this is one of the most universal experiences of living as a woman; Alienation from our bodies, and disenfranchisement from womanhood.  

Yet, we rarely talk about it.  There is an immense shame that comes with these feelings.  Questioning our place in the world and our relation to our own gender is a deeply personal experience, and the fear that we are alone in this keeps us feeling isolated from other women.  We need to have real conversations not just about the sexism women face, but the way that effects how we relate with both our own womanhood and others.  By allowing so many women to go through this struggle alone and ashamed, we leave them vulnerable.  It can create harmful behaviors like compulsory heterosexuality in an attempt to fit in, or breed hostility from women towards women who we fear will not accept us.  It prevents us from having true ownership and empowerment in our own bodies, as any attempt to find comfort in ones form is met with hostility and harassment.  It can even lead some women to question their very gender identity, as they consider abandoning womanhood all together in a desperate effort to avoid these conflicts (which I want to clarify, isn't the same thing as transmen and non-binary go through).   

Its time we break the silence and stop letting a destructive patriarchal society define what it means to be a woman.  We deserve to have a relationship with our own identity and experiences as women.  When I speak of womanhood, I do not mean some abstract feeling of being a woman or some essential ""female"" characteristics. There is no such thing.  Rather, it's the way that society shapes our perception of our own gender, and of all women as a social class.  Womanhood is about the shared struggles and experiences we have.  It's about how being women shaped our lives, outlooks, and beliefs.   Womanhood is our collective experience of being women; of being ourselves in female bodies and identities.  There is no wrong way to be a woman.  No one else gets to define it for us.",1634242441.0,Thisismyaltprofile,TwoXChromosomes
I'm sick of feminists ruining conversations.,"Hear me out, I'm from an Middle Eastern country that as you probably guessed is full of misogyny. Lately a #Metoo movement sparked in my country after a serial rapist was exposed and all the girls he harrased and raped started speaking out and uncovering the horrible horrible things a horny guy with very rich and powerful background can do. 
Finally women all over the country are telling horrifying stories about the assault they endured and are being heard. Finally the discussion is shifting towards ""definitions of rape"" and ""the importance of consent"" rather than simply blaming every bad thing that happens to women on women ever going to the streets. We started even discussing ""Marital Rape"". 
This is a HUUUUGE shift in the dialog. Like really HUGE. Nearly 99% of women have been through a form of sexual harrasment (verbal or physical) in the streets and what is always discussed is how they dress. To the point where women here plan each and every step of their day around it. 

And for the conversation to go as far as it went this time as in demands to change laws or implement existing laws and finaaaaallly blaming harrasers is a huge win.

BUT as we say here ""every nice thing has a short life"" the so called ""Feminists"" and ""Women Empowerment Influencers"" with massive platforms started jumping in the conversation and saying stuff too progressive for our society, completely out of touch and sometimes plain wrong. Stuff like ""sex work is just like any other work"", ""porn is healthy"", ""women should be allowed to walk naked in the streets if the want to"" etc...
One highly shared video where a ""feminist"" defining rape says along the lines of ""in a relationship - marriage mainly- and sometimes I will consent to having sex with you because you will be upset otherwise, this is marital rape"".
And  if you don't agree with what they're saying you are facing backlash from them for ""not respecting that the women have sacred bodies"". And it's just a confusing perspective for this society..

You can imagine how this ruined the conversation, scared hesitant people away and every conversation with a misogynistic person about women's rights and harrasment and freedom and equality just ends with him quoting these extreme opinions at you.",1595324067.0,Romiita,TwoXChromosomes
Why are we not taught to protect ourselves from dangerous and abusive people?,"I say, ""we"", to the women who like me were not taught to protect ourselves from dangerous and abusive people and situations.

Why do we:

**Ignore red flags**. I can't count how many times I've ignored red flags. I was taught to see ""the good in people."" Or I ""thought it would get better."" Or even,""they did it to someone else but they won't do it to me.""   I remember when I was 12 and there was this girl in the neighborhood who had a bad reputation. She was very aggressive and had beat up a younger girl. Despite her bad reputation, I still became friends with her. A few months later she beat me up.

**Hesitant to report bad behavior**.  I reported that girl when was I was 12. I was so hesitant. Even as an adult, I hesitate to report people who have done bad behavior towards me. I was so conditioned against ""snitching."" And even more so afraid of retaliation and things escalating.  Things escalated even worse when I didn't report.

**Feel bad for reporting.**  Am I the only one who has felt bad for reporting a wrongdoer despite them being guilty? Despite that person doing harm to me?

**Do nothing about disrespectful behavior towards us.** We don't report and in fact, we do nothing about the disrespectful behavior towards us. We passively accept it.  Either because we are scared to report or assume things will ""get better."" It doesn't. It gets worse.

**Voluntarily expose ourselves to people we technically don't have to be around.** For example, I was partnered with a sexist lab partner a few years ago. I could have easily gone to the person in charge and stated I wanted a new partner. But it felt like I was ""rejecting"" him and I felt bad about that. I felt bad about potentially ""hurting"" his feelings. So, I let myself be treated like a second class citizen to preserve this dude's feelings.

**Re-expose ourselves to people who are unrepented.** I'm guilty of this. I've voluntarily exposed myself to people who abused me, even though that person showed no signs of repentance or ever said sorry. I ended up in a situation where I was re-victimized.

Sometimes, I feel like women are just slaves, without the official title, masked by the facade of empowerment. Conditioned not only to be passive, but raised to be victims.",1647394682.0,krazyforlove,TwoXChromosomes

I’m just angry. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this. I guess I just wanted my female empowerment back. That feeling of being proud to be what I am.

"Fuck the beauty industry, and everyone who perpetuates it... Including me. - A Rant","This  is a rant / letter I wrote to myself that I wanted to share with...  Anyone, because I was feeling particularly frustrated about it today:

&#x200B;

Dear me,

**I don't blame you** for doing everything you can to flourish, in an inescapable society that bases all of a woman's value on her looks.

**I don't blame you**  for wanting to feel better about yourself in a world that constantly  criticizes every aspect of your appearance, and suggests that what you  are isn't good enough by itself, or can be ""improved"".

**I don't blame you** for being grandfathered in to an industry run by middle-aged *men*,  who've turned exploiting every possible weakness and insecurity of a woman into a multi-billion dollar industry, world-wide.

**I don't blame you**  for finding empowerment in small things, even those meant to bind you,  in a world that tries its best to strip you of it at every turn.

**And I don't blame you,**  for being silent, when every ounce of compassion and energy has been  drained away from you on matters ""more important"" than beauty.

But I **do** blame you for perpetuating the cycle.

**And I blame us all**  for the future of every young girl who looks at their body in the  mirror and thinks they're hideous and worthless, because they have normal human features like blemishes, fat, frizz, eye bags, body hair, and  ""discolouration"".

**I blame us**  for every perfectly fine woman who will be passed up by society, both  in work and love, and labeled lazy, dirty, or even ugly, simply because  they don't paint their face, straighten their hair, or rake a blade  across their flesh.

**I blame us**  for every low-income woman, who will spend their hard-earned money on  things that SHOULD be frivelous instead of real essentials, because it  gives her a modicum of dignity, pride, and opportunity more valuable  than hunger, in a society that will deny her otherwise, even though  these things could be given freely.

**I blame us**  for our hypocritical future, where we shout things like ""every body is  beautiful!"" and ""I do this for me!"" with glee,  but still feel insecure  without our masks and our trappings, and spending thousands of dollars on things we'd never want for ourselves otherwise.

But most of all, **I blame you,** for being hopeless. For pretending that ***this*** is all normal, or something that can't, or shouldn't be changed, because it's ""human nature"".

**I blame you**, for believing the lie that there's no hope for a better future, and that we can't do better than ***this***.",1620485538.0,nekoshey,TwoXChromosomes
Socialization as a transgender woman,"I expect I'll likely get a lot of push back on this, especially due to feminism appropriating misogynistic rhetoric about ""male-socialization"", but as a transwoman I internalized societal messages and norms about how women are expected to behave to a far stronger extent then I did about men, *even before I realized I was a woman*.  It's an incredibly confusing situation growing up and internalizing views of yourself that are directly contradictory to what you are told your gender is supposed to be, but I wasn't able to shake it in the slightest.  


Like all people, I didn't grow up in a void were the only things I was ever told was about how ""boys"" are expected to behave.  I was aware of the world around me, and was exposed through media, advertisements, stereotypes, peer groups, my sisters, and more.  All of us are exposed to messages about being ""boys/men"" and being ""Girls/women"", and in the case of cis-people more strongly identify with the one's that they are told are about them.  Being trans is interesting, because I was far more aware of the messaging about femininity and womanhood then I was about masculinity, even though the later is what people insisted I follow.  Everything my parents or peers tried to tell me I was supposed to do ""as a man"" just washed off me, and it just didn't feel like it applied to me.  


This isn't a ""validating"" experience, because the truth is it was destructive and harmful.  The way I was taught to see myself was damaged twice over, since I internalized damaging views of how women are told to see themselves while also being harassed for failing to meet masculine stereotypes.  


When I was a child, I was incredibly passive and frightened of the world around me.  I didn't understand at the time why this was the case, but I do now.  I internalized the idea that I wasn't supposed to be the super hero, that I wasn't supposed to be president, or a leader.  All of the people I identified closely with were women, whether it be my mother or a character on a television show, many of whom were actively dis-empowered, or domestic themselves.  The media I saw made me form a view of myself that was expectedly docile at a young age, even though a part of me always hated it, I also felt like it was *expected* of me.  


As I grew up, the dichotomy between what messages I was supposed to internalize and the one's I actually did grew wider.  I became to see myself as simultaneously sexually objectified, and neutered.  The sexual objectification of women in media is a pervasive problem, and I wasn't immune to it.  I felt uncomfortable with the world around me, especially as a teenager who felt conflicted about future relationships.  The idea of me as a sexual actor didn't stick, despite bullying over my ""asexuality"" or attempts to get me involved in toxic objectifying behaviors.  It was especially confusing because I consciously knew that society expected me to be the ""active"" pursuer, but internally I had this expectation that men were supposed to pursue me.  I even ingrained this idea that my future was to get married and have children.  I did not want to feel like this, and I didn't enjoy the way I felt like I was supposed to behave, but I had internalized so deeply that I didn't know how to be anything else.  I was physically incapable of taking on ""male"" roles when I felt like everything in media that I associated with screamed at me to do something different.  


Ultimately, I ended up with a serious case of compulsory heterosexuality (Comphet), which was mistaken heavily as male homosexuality.  To those who didn't grow up in the situation I did, I know how unfathomable this concept must be. I can hear the replies now screaming about how ""Society tells men they are supposed to objectify and date women. Etc. Etc.""  I didn't understand it either for the longest time.  But when all the people I identified with were women.  By that age I had already internalized passivity.  I already felt like I was supposed to wait for someone else to ask me out.  I had already consumed and identified with so many damaging portrayals of women in media that I genuinely thought that was the life I was supposed to live.   


I didn't know what to do with these mismatched messages myself, and it was a very confusing time for me where I didn't understand what was going on.  I made the mistake of believing that because I internalized the roles placed upon woman, that meant I had to be with a man to live the life I was told I was going to have.  I even dated men, despite not being all that attracted to them or desiring to be treated in that way, because I had come to believe it was what I was \*expected\* to have.  I ended up in many damaging, toxic, sexually abusive situations because of it.  A deeply confused young adult, who has formed deep seated views of themselves as supposed to be sexually desirable, having low agency, and expected to be docile made me easily victimized.  Being seen as a male in that situation only served to heighten the confusion and vulnerability I faced, and I was so deeply ostracized from other men at that point that I was desperate for connection.  


I genuinely can't explain how confusing and uncomfortable it is to still believe you are a boy, but internalizing all the messages directed at women.  I couldn't help feel like I was constantly being told to behave one way, while also being punished and harassed for it.  I was conflicted between what I felt society was telling me and what my peers were telling me.   Adopting a view of myself based on how women are taught to view themselves was a completely unconscious, involuntary process.   I would much rather have believed all those things most boys are taught, about leadership and empowerment and strength...but I couldn't.  It just didn't stick as well as the messages directed towards women did, even though it was rarely directed at me specifically. I was completely, and totally confused.  It didn't even matter that I *hated* how I saw myself and I despised female gender roles.  That still wasn't enough for me to digest the messages society tries to force down men's thoughts because it wasn't who I saw myself as internally.  I was already too inexorably damaged by my inability to tune out what society was telling me women (including myself even though I didn't know it yet) was supposed to be.  


When I hear people talk about ""Male socialization"" it hurts me on an incredibly deep level.  I wish I was able to believe that the things we teach boys applied to me.  I have only ever been harmed by my inability to relate to most male characters or see myself in them.  If I didn't allow my view of myself to be shaped by the socialization directed at women, I would be a much healthier person then I am today.    


I would eventually realize I was a woman, and start medically transitioning.  Undoing the damage that socialization had done to my view of self took years.  It took years to take back my sexual agency and sexuality (I'm an exclusive WLW), to break free of social norms, to stop following ridiculous outdated gender roles.  But it was only once i accepted myself as a woman, and  acknowledged that I wasn't a male, that i could actually begin to unpack and undo the damage of forced female gender roles.  Until that moment, I was so distracted trying to be man enough that I didn't realize I had to learn what being a woman *actually* meant and that i needed to free myself of the shackles of those harmful messages.    


Thanks to anyone who read this.  I tried to articulate the concept as best as I could, but it's difficult. I've met many transwoman who have this experience, but it's difficult to talk about due to the sheer complexity and confusion. I received both set of messages, the ones' given to men about how they are supposed to act and the one's directed at women.  And even though I would have preferred the former, subconsciously knowing I was a woman forced me to adopt the latter.  And it sucked, badly.  I guess I'm glad to finally type this out here, because it feels impossible like I will ever be taken seriously on this matter.   Being raised the wrong gender didn't prevent me from internalizing a deeply harmful view of myself, it just made it worse.",1596390898.0,Transfeministalt,TwoXChromosomes
Artsy friend wants to do a 'female empowerment' group photo shoot...Should I participate?,"I'm a 20 year old female who goes to school with and is friends with a girl who does art/photography as a hobby. She has asked me to be a part of a 'female empowerment' themed group photo shoot. 

I'm not 100% on all the details, but it would basically be 2-3 females and 2-3 males, posing in ways that, as she puts it 'turns the tables' on what we normally see. Her idea is to have the guys strip down (either to like boxers or fully nude) for some of the poses (since it's usually the girls), while the girls pose with them fully clothed. Poses with the girls being in 'positions of power', etc. 

I know most of the other people she is asking to pose for the shoot. What do you all think? On one I like the idea, but on the other hand I'm a bit nervous about the idea? Any thoughts or advice? ",1540423439.0,SeaDelay,TwoXChromosomes

"YSK about PardadaPardadi, school for girls in rural India providing free education, healthcare and enhancement of livelihood","Hi all! I have been a follower of this school/institution for some years now, and if you like to hear/participate about women's education like me, you might like to get to know this.

I will quote what they say in the [website](https://education4change.org/), they do a great job at explaining their aim: 

""Founded in the year 2000, PPES has been working for holistic rural  development through social and economic empowerment of women and girls  in Western Uttar Pradesh. PPES provides free education, job  opportunities, healthcare, and livelihood enhancement for girls and  women from the marginalized sections of society and enables them to  break out of the cycle of poverty.""

I don't know why it never occurred to me sharing it in Reddit, but maybe some more people can know about them and that would be great.

Not only they bring education, hope and care for these girls, but for the entire village. Since the lockdown, I have seen how they provided food and healthcare to the people in nearby villages. Sometimes these girls only have the food the school has to offer them as their main meal.

They are not very known but they do a lot for the community, I think these people are making the world better.",1604957453.0,DieBlackfisk,TwoXChromosomes
Scary bar situations,"I'm a college student and turned 21 somewhat recently, so I haven't spent much time going out to real bars and interacting with ""real world"" people outside of my normal bubbles. Last week I was going out with friends and decided to have fun and go the nine yards with fake eyelashes and makeup and my boobs out. I'd never considered myself the kind of person who'd get hit on a lot, in hindsight, I'm really kind of terrified of how I reacted to it for the first time.

&#x200B;

Three separate men at three separate bars did the exact same thing, which is fascinating - inserted themselves at our table, made kinda small talk, and as soon as I expressed any lack of interest (physically turning away from them and towards my friends), they flipped a switch and got so incredibly creepy. \*whispering in my ear\* *hey just wanted to let you know.... you're so incredibly hot... you single? you're just... you look so fine...*

&#x200B;

We were at a bar on campus that's pretty much exclusively students from our school, and one of these guys jokingly chugged one of my drinks and then said he owed me one and would go grab it, and came back, and I totally accepted it without thinking twice, until my friend leans in and says ""does that taste alright??"" That's obviously like textbook bar safety practice, to not take drinks from strangers, and I didn't even bat an eye at it. (luckily the drink was fine) Later, my friend started poking fun at him, (in hindsight probably to anger him and make him leave), but I am so programmedly conflict avoidant that when he got annoyed I said ""no no don't take it personally ya know she's too drunk to know what she's saying"" which was absolutely a lie. My girl friend and I ended up slipping away and wanted to leave, but our guy friend was at the table chumming it up with him. It's so scary that my guard was down because we were on campus and I assumed he went to my school, that I was so unwilling to do anything to upset him, and also that my guy friend (admittedly a little socially clueless) was completely unaware of what we were experiencing.

&#x200B;

At the next bar, another one of those guys completely cornered me on a bench where I couldn't escape in any direction and kept getting closer and closer, and he was physically a very big guy. In retrospect I realized that I lied to him about not being single and made up other excuses because I was legitimately a little afraid for my own safety and how he would react if I said anything as direct as ""you're making me uncomfortable, I am not interested."" Instead, when he asked if I was single, I lied and said no, and he asked how long I'd been dating. I said ""over a year"" and he said ""ah so still pretty new, pretty fresh, right"" SO CREEPY??

&#x200B;

To top the whole night off, I accidentally made eye contact with a guy around the corner who was peeing in public, who proceeded to then follow me and my guy friend several blocks, yelling at me.

&#x200B;

None of these situations were particularly upsetting to me in the moment, probably because I was pretty drunk, but in hindsight, it's so scary how easy it is to let go of the kinds of female empowerment things that you can preach about during the daytime when you're finally the one in that situation. There's no winning when you're terrified how any one of them might react if you dare engage with them. At the very least, you know that some would respond with something like ""what the hell I wasn't even hitting on you I was just giving you a compliment you're so fucking rude women are the worst""

And at the end of the day I'm really glad I at least put myself in a situation with good friends who were looking out for me and had a guy who walked me home.",1580773867.0,mongoose_with_rabies,TwoXChromosomes
*TRIGGERING* My Rapist Had A Baby Girl And I Felt Inspired To Write Him This Letter That I Will Not Send Him,"At 2 am a crisp freeze shot suddenly through my body starting in the lower part of my back, traveling through my limbs all the way to my fingertips. My triceps suddenly pricked up in a mass of goosebumps. My jaw shook so violently that the first idea I had was that I had suddenly and all at once contracted coronavirus from just the mere thought of you. 

I cradled my shaking body in my own two arms as I lay alone in my bed. The covers pulled tightly around me. I snuggled myself as deeply as I could into my mattress that cost ⅓ of you and your wife’s combined monthly income.

Knowing you live a mundane existence usually gives me such sweet joy. The fact that I get to live this life of financial freedom and success, creativity and empowerment alone instead of the one I would have with you is all the karma I need.  I used to hope you would die a slow painful death. One that would take away all the years you took from me. 7 years of 10 times the suffering you put on me. Then one day I realized if you suffered you’d be surrounded by loved ones calling you brave, telling you how amazing you are and feeding you saccharine thoughts that might actually convince you that you aren’t as horrible as you are. So instead I wished for you a bland life. No suffering, no tragedy, no sickness, no financial comfort, no success, no life that you hoped for yourself. Just you, and your wife, you felt societally forced to marry due to knocking her up because your “religious morals” dictated that birth control is “against God’s will”. An ignorant lady who clearly doesn’t know the real you, not the YOU I know. I must have been the last partner you ever really shared your true self with. I know more about your dark past than she will ever know. If I don’t she must be as fucked in the head as you. It was 10 years ago I imagined that right here and now I’d be sitting at a dinner table with you and our two kids and I can still remember how my head pounded with stress and my stomach turned violently at the thought.

This feeling though that enveloped my entire body with chill and sickness startled me. After a minute of anger that at the moment I was thinking about you, the physical discomfort occurred I shot up out of bed. My legs stiff, my body frozen. I made my way to the shower and turned the water on. The usually cool water felt like icicles stinging my skin as they shot out of the showerhead. I quickly turned the knob to the right which immediately showered me with what felt like lava, but on the coldest parts of my body, it was just what I needed. I waved my arms viciously through the steaming shower trying to warm them up. It was too hot for all of me though so I fiddled frustrated with the temperature. Left, too cold, right, too hot.   
Two years ago I almost did something. I finally spoke with a therapist. I spoke with a lawyer. I had and still have a message you sent me online admitting to what you did to that high school girl. The one who didn’t “have the body of a 15-year-old.” There was a moment in time where I had the power to change your life forever, the way you changed mine. 2 years ago you almost faced a day where you would have been put in handcuffs in front of your family and would have had to admit to all of them why this was happening to you. The only reason you bypassed all that embarrassment and heartache was that I care more about loving me than I care about hurting you. I had a budding successful business that was growing. I was on my way to financial stability. I was doing all the things that would lead me to now where I live a life of comfort you will never have, and that was all far more important than prioritizing getting justice for what you did to me. 

Finally, I began to relax a little bit. I found the stopper and placed it over the drain to let the tub fill up. I sat my body down with my legs Indian Style while the hot water soothingly hit my head and steaming water poured down my body in little streams. My eyes shut as I imagined these words I wanted to say to you. The words I have wanted the world to hear for 10 years. The words I have been too afraid to send to you for the simple reason that you might respond back. For you to respond back would turn this into an interaction. To interact with someone creates a relationship with someone. Even a small one. I want nothing with you. You’re stuck in my head which is where you will unfortunately always be and that is far more than I wish to live with already.

You had a little girl. Earlier this month you had your second child and it HAD to be a fucking girl.

I know the thoughts clouding your head, the things you are, the things you want to be. You are now a daddy to a girl. I’m here to remind you that that’s not all you are.  
You are also a rapist to a girl.  
You are a predator to a girl.  
You are an animal abuser to a girl.  
You are a pedophile to a girl.  
Don’t you dare forget me and what you are and always will be. Don’t forget the 15-year-old girl you sent photos of your penis to. Don’t forget the dog you sexually molested. Don’t forget the men you used to get off with even though you would ""never emotionally be with a man"". Don’t forget how I pushed you away and begged you to stop and you forced yourself inside me. Don’t forget the time I said I trusted you not to put it in me and you did so anyway. Don’t forget what you told me about your future children, because I won’t.  
Don’t forget how you said, “if I ever have THOSE types of feelings for our kids”.   
“If”  
FUCKING “IF”!!  


Who the fuck beside someone who is completely evil down in their soul would even question that something like that could ever be a possibility?  
When you hold your baby don’t forget a rapist holds your baby, a predator holds your baby, an animal abuser holds your baby, a pedophile holds your baby.  
A man who suggested it was a possibility he might want to bring sexual harm to her one day holds your baby.   


Don’t forget, there is a person out here in the world who does tell her story about her rapist. She’s always scared to admit that she was with someone so sick and disgusting, even for such a short amount of time, but she finds the strength to tell it. The story of US floats around freely in the world. It’s one of the millions. The chill that I feel though is that one day another story will float just as free, and it will be from the girl who will call you “Daddy”.

Need some book suggestions for young teen girls.,"**TL;DR** Need some YA female-centric book suggestions that'll help my 13yo cousins better understand gender, sex, healthy relationships, their bodies, etc. Fiction and nonfiction.

I have two 13yo cousins whom I absolutely adore. They are like the little sisters I never had. Unfortunately, I don't get to be very present in their lives, and recently I've started to notice some troubling trends in the way they interact with boys and their mindset around gender, sex, and relationships in general. I see the effects of their environment in the way they respond to boys' harassment and their friends pressuring them to explore sex and drinking/smoking (difficulty saying no, thinking harassment is affection, etc).

I've tried to have the sex talk with them once or twice, going over safe sex and such, but I don't think it went well with one of them (the more 'adventurous' one). Since I'm not very present in their lives and nobody else around  makes an effort to educate them about these topics, I'm hoping there might be some fiction or nonfiction books I can recommend them. Or even fanfiction with positive female representation. Anything a 13yo girl may like that portrays healthy relationships, self-love/self-empowerment, healthy lifestyles, gender education, sex education, etc.

If it helps at all, one of them is really into slice-of-life YA romance (like John Green books even though I personally do not like him or his portrayals of relationships/people). The other one is going through a Hot Topic edgy angsty phase and likes fantasy/supernatural romance stories.

Can women ever go to a nightclub and not get groped? (LONG RANT),"I hope the title isn't too misleading, but basically I have a story and I hope it will prompt discussion about the treatment of women.

I went out Friday night with a friend after work, no plans for it to be a late one but it went that way. It started out fairly normal, meal and wine and then we got to the first bar. We got chatting to 3 guys,  let's call them Single, Taken and Married, because that's what they were. They were funny and friendly but a bit douchey and arrogant. Also I could immediately tell these guys were less interested in me than my friend. For the record I don't think she is any prettier than me, but she is younger by several years and all these guys were around my age. It kinda bugged me though because it was the first instance where I realised we were not just one of the guys hanging out, the conversation immediately got risque and sexual. It was not a friendly interaction, we were prey, and they were the predators. I saw a thread recently talking about how men don't see women as people, they are 'other', and it felt just like that. That's where I should've ended the night really. But I didn't.

When they left the bar they told us where they were going (another bar) and we stupidly followed shortly after. What basically happened was we watched them wandering around, chatting up other girls and eventually finding us and inviting us on to yet another place, a club. At this point Married was groping me and I was trying not to be bothered, I guess I hadn't had much male attention in a while and while I didn't encourage it I didn't shut it down either. My friend meanwhile was getting cosy with Taken and by the time we got inside was all over him. She wanted to get off with him so she did. Meanwhile Single and Married were dancing with me and it was hands everywhere, up my skirt and at one point my bra was unhooked (keep in mind these guys were in their 30s). At this point I got pissed off and wanted to leave so we finally did. 

I feel shitty because as the older party and sensing these guys were bad news I should've stopped it sooner. Maybe I should've chewed my friend out for cheating with a guy in a relationship. Ultimately these guys behaved so disrespectfully and I feel like I let them. I felt like I couldn't say no to their groping in the club without being seen as a killjoy, couldn't get away from them because they had been buying all the drinks all night, couldn't get outraged at the fact they NEVER EVEN ASKED ME WHAT MY NAME WAS. I wasn't a person to them at all.

Now I'm sure many of you would say I had many opportunities to say no but alcohol makes us do dumb things. What saddens me is that this isn't an uncommon interaction with men, and certainly isn't uncommon in a nightclub. We didn't know these guys that well but does that excuse them? My friend clearly had no qualms about what she wanted, and to her all the groping was probably a means to an end. But for me I really feel that there was no opportunity for female empowerment here, no way I could have made these guys treat us better. Am I wrong?",1401624215.0,bunnybroiler,TwoXChromosomes
What's your first period story?,"I just read another post in the subreddit, and it got me thinking about my own first period story. It's nothing special, but I do remember it well.

My period started when I was 10 and I was the first in my class to get it, so it was very new to me. It was quite straightforward really, I went to the bathroom at school, there was some blood on the paper after I went, and then I called my mom and cried about how I didn't want to become an adult. A friend of mine, let's call her Clara, walked me home and consoled me on the way. She wanted to know what it was like, as she hadn't gotten her period yet. Her support made me feel a lot better actually.

However, my family moved country shortly after it happened, and when I returned to my friends over the summer they told me that there had been a fight (verbal) between the two main girl cliques in school. The fight was over who had gotten their period first, me or Clara. Apparently, as soon as Clara had gotten her period, she had been going around telling all the girls in the class that she had gotten it. Since I had only told my closest friends (including Clara), the other girls didn't know I had gotten my period. So tension ensued between my friends and the other girl clique. It even got so bad that the school had to have a special sex ed. class specifically for the girls, dedicated to the empowerment of other girls and period talk, just to defuse the situation. Luckily the situation was diffused when I returned.

My next period wouldn't come for another year, so I was allowed to grieve my childhood for quite some time and prepare for the next time, and after a while I even realized that I obviously was not an adult just because I was bleeding once a month.

Now, 15 years later, it makes me chuckle how something that I didn't even want also turned into some sort of status symbol at school.

So, after my long ramble, what is your first period story?

TLDR; I got my period when I was 10, and was the first in my class. As soon as another girl got their period, a fight ensued between the girls in my class over who got their period first.",1552738541.0,smirango,TwoXChromosomes
How do I talk to my guy friends about this?,"okay so to preface this i'm 17f senior in highschool and my friend group is a even mix of girls and guys. And I know that there are bigger problems out there but I think it's still important to address this with my friends since these small things carry over to when they grow up. 


So on to my problems with my guy friends: 
I have 2 guy friends who work as bussers at a restaurant for the past year. Me, a girl friend, and a guy friend are looking for jobs and they've been telling us to apply at the restaurant because they're short on people. 



And so my guy friend applied and he got the job the next day. Later on me and my girl friend apply too and we're just waiting to hear back from them.

I told them we applied and we were hit with comments like

""Are you sure you can handle it""

""Remember, you're gonna *ACTUALLY* have to work"" 

""This is *real* work"" 
etc, other condescending comments


and later on I got really excited about something irrelevant and they told me, ""when you work you need to learn how to control your emotions"" and I was really mad in the moment and just walked off and I hear them behind me say ""See? She can't be doing that and get emotional in front of a customer""


And this really peeves me because my other guy friend who did apply has no experience whatsoever at all, yet I don't hear comments like this when he got the job. So it's really offensive when they discredit my work ethic because of my femininity without actually seeing me work.

We're also officers for a women empowerment club and they always make fun and trivialize our club. Anyways, I hate to be *that person* but I feel like these offhanded comments normalize the same sexist behavior that women face in the work place and in politics. I know that a whole soapbox won't help because they won't take us seriously so how do you guys recommend I go about this so I can effectively address my concerns to them to them?

Despair at world and larger injustices after trauma (tw),"Situation: I was raped (no details) over 1 and a half years ago, yet it somehow affects me so badly the longer time passes. I never got any help for it, and I am beginning to think it has affected how I can think in the long run. 

**In short:** 

So often I feel so much pain for the world as a whole, especially in situations related to gender, sexism, misogyny. This has gotten to a point where even small things which usually I would not be bothered by affect my so deeply, causing distress and anger. Its almost as if I see things which don’t even bother others, which angers me even more. 

**More details:** 

For example, I was speaking with my boyfriend about happy things, such as one day maybe even getting married. However, even at something which is as sweet as this my brain found awful because all I could think about was how systematically women lose their last names and so much freedom when getting married. This isn’t necessarily related to my personal position! I mean I feel pain for the fact women as a whole are (generally) forced to take the names of the man, that children get born with the name of the father… These issues may sound trivial, but I get so so upset! Its awful, yet I continue to become so distressed from everyday situations. 

I’ll think for hours on how girls clothing is constantly made shorter, tighter, thinner… and boys not. How a man asked me on a date when he knew I was 15. How women are still taken less seriously than men. That in some countries being drunk is an excuse for rape. The sexualisation of children. The gender-imbalances across so many fields. That to be taken seriously women have to act like men. That ‘femininity’ is a totally constructed concept which ultimately doesn’t allow women to be okay being natural. That some many people across the globe believe that there are genuine differences between the abilities of genders. That reproductive care is so hard to come by. That medical research has only been done historically on men and therefore women are more likely to die from a heart attack because we didn’t know female symptoms. That when under aesthetic for a routine operation women can be given non-consensual pelvic exams by medical students which they have no idea about. That women are expected to do so many things around the house - that we are conditioned to do such tasks. That we are expected to not appear to attractive if we want to be professional. That so many popular TV programmes have violent sex scenes or even rape scenes. That such widespread catcalling takes place. That people believe there is no problem. 

I come from Europe and growing up always found nudity and sex totally okay. Logically, I am fine with natural bodies and everyone being naked. However, in practice, I see the sexualisation of women at large and it bothers me SO much. For instance: the porn industry. This horrifies me so so much you cannot believe. From coercion and exploitation, the fact that non-consensual porn even exists, the hyper-sexualisation of the young and vulnerable, the disparaging comments made to females, the fact that in modern relationships often you have to be okay with porn to be ‘cool’, to so many other things. It really affects me because i think of all the injustices and lives which have been wrecked. I do try to see otherwise! I watch the female empowerment videos on the women who shoot porn and love it… yet all I can see is an industry which exploits them ultimately and also a huge gender imbalance (why aren’t men at large becoming naked for empowerment?)

This takes a whole new level when something really triggering does come up. And somehow the triggers from rape are everywhere. I mean everywhere. TV programmes, stupid Buzzfeed articles, the news, friends, discussions at uni…. literally I feel I cannot escape. Even things such as the news, where maybe an assaulter is in prison (i.e. a ‘good’ thing) gets me so emotional. I don’t know what to do - I feel so hopeless because its so frequent and that brings me so much frustration and sadness. 

To add to the triggers of life thrown at you, Im struggling even more because I’m recovering from anorexia. Mental progress aside (the main bit), I have gained a lot of weight in the past few months. This may sound irrelevant, but I went from very ugly indeed, with absolutely no curves, to ‘healthy’. This just means I get a lot more attention from men. I get ‘compliments’ which I just can’t take. This ranges from catcalling, to just small comments on my appearance from female relatives (“your boyfriends is lucky to have you” and other disgusting things). I feel constantly objectified and sexualised. I feel even guiltier though because sometimes I ‘want’ these compliments from men in a weird way? Like it validates me? Yet simultaneously I’m so disgusted with them and myself. 

What do I do? I feel so hopeless because i can’t change the world i live in, and am told that I am too sensitive / people don’t see that these problems exist.",1585179453.0,ajjs,TwoXChromosomes
Assault at Church,"**I’m writing this encounter nearly thirteen years after it happened. It’s sleepless nights like now when I’m compelled to reopen old memories. So, if you don’t mind reading about a naive preteen, asinine (and racist) adults and one sick pervert all mushed into one story, here goes:

-

It all started in the summer of 2006 at a local teen bible study group (where really it was a place for teens to hang out and volunteer at). The location was held in an Asian Empowerment-Christian church so everyone was 99.9% Asian so my being not full Asian (I’m Japanese and Mexican), I nonetheless stood out like a sore thumb. And other church members often made jabs at my tan skin and high bridged nose, and adding things like “Sorry we don’t serve tacos! Just fried rice!” to even doubting my Japanese last name (“Did you take this name from an anime?”). I sound like I’m digressing but this information will be relevant in a bit. 

In retrospect, I don’t know why I didn’t catch these red flags. I should’ve just left and enjoyed my summer at home. I sat alone most of the time anyway. No one noticed my discomfort save for one person. 

Logan.

Logan was this tall Asian twenty-something year old man. He was related to one of the Bible study leaders but only showed up a few times a month. Logan was slim and tall, wore Hollister apparel and slick, black hair that parted at the middle. I remember his humor and laidback style made me feel comfortable around him. Logan even went as far as to ruffle my hair and sit next to me during bible study. He even went as far as commenting on my looks, saying he liked my eyes a lot. That I looked mature for a thirteen year old. Quite the charmer, I thought.

One day, we were supposed to meet up at a baseball game and Logan offered me and a few others a ride for carpool. As luck would have it, when I arrived at the church (our meet up location), he was the only car there. I asked him where the others were to which he replied that they they all left early since they didn’t want to wait up on us. I found it strange since it wasn’t even that late to begin with. Ignoring my gut, I silently went inside the car anyway.

 This is when it starts getting scary. 

As I was opening the backdoor, he was motioning for me to sit in front. I usually didn’t feel comfortable sitting in front with non-family members at the time. I insisted that I was okay - I even joked that he was my chauffeur. But Logan’s face didn’t show that he took my awkward humor well. He turned around with a serious expression. Not saying a word. I stared back, wondering what was wrong. Before I was able to ask, Logan reached over for my hand and began smothering kisses on it. Stunned and confused, I immediately yanked my hand back. I was speechless, not even asking why he was doing what he was doing. His eyes were still glaring and his usual kind voice was now more hitched and deep. “It’s fine. You know me. You like me,” he whispered as he unclipped his seatbelt. He began lifting his body towards the backseat. In that split second, I knew I was in danger. I saw that the backdoor wasn’t locked and I opened the car to make a run for it. I don’t know what came over me that day but I remember losing control of my body at that moment. All senses were hazy. 

I later found myself in the pizza parlor that was down the street. I sat there in one of the booths. I just had to be around other people. Other strangers where I could feel immersed once again. Hidden away from Logan’s eyes. After what felt like an hour, I called my friend (who lived nearby) if she and her mom could pick me up. 

It was the last time I ever stepped into those church grounds. I didn’t tell anyone immediately and I had planned it that way until I received a call from the church leader - Logan’s sister. She asked if I was alright and where I had been. It was then that I broke down and spilled the story about what happened to me. She didn’t say anything. Only silence hung around the atmosphere. I doubted at that moment if I made the right decision. 

Logan’s sister finally broke the silence and I wished she hadn’t.

“You’re at that age when...we don’t know what we seek. We look for something to compensate what we’re missing...which is usually the case for Hispanic girls like you. It’s no wonder you guys get pregnant so early, you know? Break away from that, ok?”

I didn’t even believe what I was hearing. She was insulting me in every way possible under the guise of a benevolent church leader. Someone who was meant to help - not judge you nor your race. I felt like throwing up. Is this really what my experience is worth to others?

My thirteen year old self didn’t say anything and just hung up. I hated myself for even trusting her - of all people. His sister. I had all these thoughts swirling over me. What did I do to deserve this unfair situation? I didn’t bother anyone. I was not trying to tempt anyone. Why did it matter whether I was Mexican too? Where is Logan now? Would he come back and show up to finish what he started?

Such thoughts accompanied me all throughout my teen years. I couldn’t help it. The damage was done. I was stupid and naive. 

Fast forward to now, I am doing much better thankfully. I’m not fully absolved from my past unwanted memories but things have indeed improved. I have loving friends and a sweet significant other. My parents are still my greatest pride. 

I just hope that on nights like now that my idle mind doesn’t betray me anymore. I don’t ever want to meet or let alone think of Logan or his sister again.",1554966681.0,LokiHeart,TwoXChromosomes

My exsperience in an Automotive trade school (Warning:word vomit),"Throw away because reasons. Also this is my first post on reddit...so yay!?

I am a young woman(18) attending a well known and predominantly male automotive school, and I just need somewhere that I can be open about my experiences and get insight on how to handle the blatant misogonistic views of both the students and instructors. Prepare your selves, word vomit is imminent...

At this specific school the only one in my class level (aka were the newbies). I have a wonderful and a supportive father (who's a mechanic), mother and two kickass sisters. All who new the journey I was about get into when I decided to step into this male ruled field. But going here has been more of a challenge that I anticipated and I don't know what to do. 

There is an overwhelming sense of ""you don't belong here"" in this school. There are other girls who are upperclassmen but still I am uncomfortable being the only one of my class. Here are a few recent reasons why...

Almost daily the guys in my class talk about girls, or ""bitches"" as they so fondly love to use. And normally I'm fine with it. I support being open about sexuality, but there is a line between sexual objectification and sexual empowerment and they have crossed it. Just today one of my fellow students  decided to play porn on his computer (a school one mind you) with blasting sound and show it to the rest of the class. Then they proceeded to make catcalls at the screen and exchange nudes they had of their ""bitches"", ALL WITH ME SITTING RIGHT THERE! Like seriously, fuck you man! This paired with the usual ""be a man"" or my personal favorite ""what are you a bitch ass girl?"" remarks make for an emotionally draining school day. Especially when they found out I had two sisters and would not leave me alone, about if they were ""hot"" or ""bangable"".

I'm not one to get upset with that stuff but the moment it was directed towards me, I lost my cool and had to walk away. The select group of assholes that do it decided to grab each others asses and jokingly blame it on me, saying it's because ""She wanted that dick"". I swear to god that I whipped my head back so fast I could've  gotten whiplash. 

But even instructors will display sexism in lessons. They use a woman as an example for a customer who doesn't know any thing and will screw up a car, or as the one to crash, and on and on with the stereotypes.

Things like this are a normal occurrence, even from the guys who I'm friends with and are cool with me being there. I have experienced automotive specific sexism before but not like this. I thought I could handle it because I'm pretty thick skinned but this is almost unbearable. And it's almost impossible to report anything because, it will look like I can't handle it, and then people will act different around me when all I want is to be treated as an equal. 

How can I draw the line between being ""one of the boys"" and being offended? I feel like I'm STUCK. In any other situation I wouldn't hesitate to call them out, but here I feel like I'm walking on eggshells; trying not to burn bridges that I will desperately need in the future. Any advice/opinions (agreeing or not) on this issue would be of great value.",1441773013.0,Thewrenchthatcould,TwoXChromosomes
How Indian TV normalises abusive behaviour under the farce of 'women empowerment',"Although objectifying and degrading women is fairly common on Indian TV, I am talking about this show called ISHQBAAZ (closest translation would be Unabashed Lovers) because I've caught my young, impressionable niece watching it.  

This show airs on the channel Star Plus and is a part of their ""Nayi Soch"" (NEW THINKING) woman empowerment theme. 

Pardon the english, not the best. 


 ****************

**Story**

The story is about three uber rich brothers and how they face numerous difficulties in their lives.  The oldest brother (Shivaay) is the main male lead. The female lead (Anika) is some sort of a manager of the family and does odd jobs for them. 

Shivay is very particular about ‘pedigree’ (yep, uses that word) and lineage. Serious casteist undertones. Many a times is abusive (even molests the female lead), and insulting to people without a good pedigree. 

Anika the female lead is portrayed as a self-respecting, self made woman who does not possess an iota of self-respect. A ‘modern’ ‘new generation girl’ who bears the dehumanizing behaviour of the male lead for no apparent reason.  

This is what happened on the show this week: https://gfycat.com/MenacingScrawnyGibbon

Here, the hero is blackmailing the heroine into marrying her because the original girl he was supposed to marry, rich and pedigreed Ria, has run away.  This was to save his reputation infront of the media and rich business partners. In order to further pressurise Anika, Shivaay also kidnaps her disabled 6 year old brother and threatens to murder him if Anika does not comply. And viewers are excited about the upcoming romance between them!


**************

**People behind the show:**

I've looked up the producers and actors on the show, their social media is full of pretty pictures and expensive things. What actually upsets me is how oblivious, unconcerned these people are about the impact the content they create has. Being urban rich shields them from having to face any consequences of the culture they are creating. 

Their targets, middle class girls and women from small town India who are already treated as second class citizens, consider this 'new thinking' meek and submissive behaviour to be normal. 

Female actresses (Surbhi Chanda here) are the worst hypocrites. They cry and demand  equal pay and status and yet continue to do juvenile, demeaning roles which propagate women are in fact inferior to men. See the cycle? 

Nakuul Mehta who plays the male lead here [Challenges mindsets that women belong to the kitchen,](https://twitter.com/NakuulMehta/status/776699297001725952) and also glorifies characters that abuse and molest women on screen.

“Waiting for the day he realises his love for her.” 
“he is angry because he is in love”
“so rude I feel bad for the heroine”
“A feminist in me is so so furious after watching the epi that feel like slapping Shivay by myself also but deep inside I <3 him”

[if he is caring, he has anger too. as a girl i felt bad the way he talkd but soon everything will be ok](http://imgur.com/TnAqOBF) [this just gets me]


“shivay crossed all limits today....anyway an interesting episode""


[Fans concerned that the couple’s theme romantic song is played during the abuse](http://imgur.com/jzG6tS8)


These young girls have internalized the notion that someone who loves you has the right to be abusive towards you. And even though some notice how rapey the hero is, is more of a villain for kidnapping the disabled kid brother, the audience is ready to let it go so that the ‘romance’ track can begin, all is forgotten, and the couple ends up together. 

One thing more, what if the male lead was a truck driver or a labourer in place of a rich businessman. Would these girls think it was ok to stay in an abusive relationship then?

"If you're not okay now, you will be.","Over the past year or so, I've noticed a lot more female empowerment material dominating social media, blogs and discussion boards. You're beautiful just the way you are, you don't need to be a size two to be worthy of love, your size does not define you.
Awesome and true messages, every one of them. 
But here's my problem:
They're still dominantly aesthetics-based. Every one of them.

From the ages of 3-12, I was molested and raped by my older brother. I've always been petite, and with age, grew into a pleasantly curvaceous figure. Long blonde hair, big blue eyes, and full lips. My problem was never with the person people perceived me to be. It was with the hideous, tar colored, cancerous film I felt crawling all over my insides. My soul, my heart, my confidence, my self worth. All teeming with a living, parasitic sickness left over from the feeling of someone's unwanted hands on my body, stealing my adolescence. 
I'm posting here because, well, firstly, and albeit a bit selfishly, it makes some part of me feel better putting a mask on and sharing my story. But also because I've overcome all of that. And if there's hope for me, it's out there for you, too.
For years, I let boys use me. I threw my body into relationships, expecting to get emotional love back. I performed for an audience only I could see. ""See, I'm normal, I'm fine. I can have sex and laugh prettily and accept a beer and dance just like the rest of them!"" When really it wasn't filling the void I felt inside. Like something had been seperated from me, something fundamental missing from the ""normal girl"" makeup I strived so fiercely to obtain. 
I didn't tell a soul about what happened to me until I was 17. For all of those years, I was scared of rejection, and terrified of pity. I developed a strong shell, a mean bitch attitude to tell the world I didn't want their love, hell, I didn't need it. I was so sure I had it together, so sure what happened to me was just a fluke. Everyone goes through shit, what's so different about me? Why do I deserve concern when so many others are suffering?
I wish I had an ""aha!"" moment. Some milestone where I turned around, some guardian angel entering my life and making it all better. For your sake, I wish I could tell you that that's how it works. Because that would be the easy version, the movie script ending. But those things never happened. 
Eventually, I told the people I loved about it. I came to accept that glaring flaw, and to work to repair it. I made a conscious decision to change my behavior, to not let what happened to me define the person I was going to be. I want a husband who loves me unconditionally, and a happily ever after. And if I continued down the path of self destruction I was on, I wouldn't get that. I'm 22 now, and I still find myself staring into space, falling into my old hole. But I shake my head, pick myself up out of there, and keep going. Keep loving, keep fighting, keep laughing and keep crying. Your image does not define you. The way you're dressed when you walk in a room does not make or break you. The strength under your clothes, the quiet resolve to keep going. The kindness towards those whose stories you don't know. That makes you who you are. Those are the things that make you unique and beautiful. Woman are a big target for physical bashing. The inner strength to show them up and smile through their jeering, that makes you worth it. Love you, and others will too. It's just a matter of time, and remember that you deserve as much of that as you need to take.

EDIT. Sorry for the wall of text.. Phones don't format the way computers do!

How being in the web camming community saved me.,"Just some details:

I made a huge mistake 5 years ago today.


The webcam community effectively saved me from many of the possible repercussions of that bad decision.


The day after I turned 16 I met this man (he was 18) and we started dating, he moved in with my family and I a short 4 months later and things went well, for just a little while. Slowly but surely he became emotionally abusive, and at times got physical with me. I was trapped at that point, not literally but in my mind I thought there was no way out. He had me convinced that nobody else would want me just because he had taken my virginity from me.

 I put up with him cheating, hiding his phone, looking through my phone at his every whim just to criticize about anything that I may have done that would upset him, which would have been just about anything. Slowly all of my friends got fed up with me, for choosing him over them. It wasn't my fault I let him manipulate me into that. I allowed him to treat me the way he did. I was weak and at the time I was to naive to realize it.

 All of my family told me to leave him, to find someone better and I was to naive to realize just how right they were. After dating for approximately 3 years, and living together for all but the first 4 months of the relationship I had decided that I need a job, but I had no vehicle and lived to far out of town to walk. I started looking at online options, and I found web cam modeling.

 At first I wasn't sure, because I am shy and modest and honestly I am a goody two shoes, teachers pet, nerd type. I never snuck out and partied in school, and it took me until my graduation party to drink my first beer. I didn't do drugs and rebelling wasn't exactly my forte. Well, web cam modeling became my ""dirty little secret"", it became hard to explain to my family and friends where all of my money had been coming from. I lied, still lie to this day (hah). But only those in the webcam community made me feel worth something. My confidence boosted, from hearing hundreds of strangers (soon to be friends) call me beautiful, and expressing their desire to make me their own. Now it may be weird, but many of them even expressed that they'd love to marry me, after only seeing me half naked and talking for a few minutes, but that didn't change how it made me feel empowered. 

This empowerment gave me the power to leave what became an abusive relationship that I shouldn't have been in, in the first place. In the process of trying to leave my boyfriend at the time had me trapped in my bedroom blackmailing me, saying he wouldn't let me leave the room until I called my mother telling her what a fucking slut I was, just because I cam. (I never cheated on him, and I had his permission beforehand to cam in order to pay all of our bills, his and mine.) He kicked me out of the apt I paid for and proceeded to take half of my paycheck out of the ATM before I knew it was even there, for that 3 days I lived in a city, spending a majority of my time at walmart attempting to sleep on benches.

 I cried a lot, I thought everything was my fault because that's what he made me believe. I went back knowing I had no where else to go, (at that time we lived 1,000miles away from my family and I had no friends or family nearby, not enough money for a flight or bus home.) So I went back to the apartment begging him to let me in just so I could sleep in a bed. He convinced me to be his again, he guilted me into it by telling me he'd commit suicide if I didn't. Our relationship was on the rocks, and eventually we got in another fight, this one ending with him kicking me out while I was half naked wearing only a robe (I had just took a shower). I fought my way back inside to get dressed and to grab my essentials (phone, wallet, glasses) and he made me leave with nothing but those things. On my way out he grabbed my phone and smashed it against the brick building beside our apartment, he had also punched me in the face. And that was my last straw I decided I was leaving for good, with or without my belongings. I had no phone and no way to call for help, I had 3 maxed out credit cards, no money in the bank, and I was literally a naive 19 year old girl. I had the clothes on my back and not much else. 

A very close regular from the camming community came to my rescue and sent me enough money for a plane ticket, train ticket (to the nearest airport) and money for a taxi, just so I could escape. He sent extra so I'd have money to buy food. Without him, I have no idea where I would be now. I was scared, because he wasn't flying me home, I requested to go stay with him. Why? Well my ex told my mother that I was a prostitute, and also told her i'm pansexual, which she doesn't tolerate. I was scared of my mother not wanting me back, just because of those things my ex had pounded into my head. I knew at that moment that I was worthless to everyone. So I flew to this man who I had never met, had absolutely no reason to trust (other than the fact he's covered my rent once when I was broke and sent money for groceries whenever he knew I had none).

 Everyone told me I was stupid for doing it, and I probably was, but I could've been killed by my ex, or worse been forced to live with him everyday for the rest of my life, so at that point I decided to take a risk and even if it meant potential death, rape, or torture I thought it would be better than where I was. 

My life turned out great, i'm alive he didn't harm me. We're actually dating now and he is slowly but surely helping me to feel better. I still have quirky behaviors that victims of abuse have, and sometimes they bug him, but they're slowly going away. I say sorry for everything and i'm jumpy if his arm so much as moves in my direction unexpected but I trust him and I know he would never harm me. 


I just have to thank everyone in the webcam community for helping me to realize my mistake of letting such an awful man into my life, and allowing him to over power me and make me so weak. I would also like to thank all of you for helping me feel more and more empowered each and everyday. 

TL;DR: My current boyfriend who was once just a regular on web cam chat, as well as many other viewers helped me realize that I had been a victim of an abusive relationship and that escape was possible.

"Got groped by long time ""friend""","I don't know what to do and I need people who understand to reach out to. I'm not in an environment where I'll get a lot of support.

So a while ago, after dinner, my husband and I headed upstairs to the roof where a bunch of our friends were smoking some cigarettes with his cousin. We were all gonna smoke and head to his cousin's apartment to watch a movie.

During that time I was there, one of them came up to me saying he wanted to show me something really cool. We were sitting on traditional chairs called joalis in which the seating is made out of ropes and had several parallelogramic gaps. 
At one point I felt his hand squeezing half of my butt. And my butt is so tiny it wasn't the only thing getting squeezed as I was sitting with my legs open.
 

Upon feeling his hand there I was pretty horrified and I even nudged away but I was mostly too much in shock to do or say anything about it. When he knew that it's affected me, with his face showing no sign of anything he was doing the entire time, he awkwardly took his hand out and left to the other side of the row of joalis and started conversing with my husband.

I stayed mostly quiet until we had to go downstairs.
I stopped my husband and let the rest of them head off and confessed what had happened to him. He was pretty shocked as well and asked me if I was sure a couple of times. I had to recall the entire situation. He called up his friend who had taken our pack of cigarettes downstairs.

 Now, we don't usually hang out with these guys but there had been a similar situation that took place when they had gone on a trip to an island. One of them had groped one of the girls while she was sleeping(she has a boyfriend who's always traveling due to his job and it's actually his group of friends that she got used to hanging out with. He wasn't there with them) The guy kept groping her even when she woke up and this eventually led to a lot of drama which led to him being secluded from them. They even called a lot of girls he knew and told them that he does this and handled it pretty well.

Now I don't know if this is somehow related to this situation or if he's trying to prove something because it felt as if he did this intentionally without getting turned on or anything. It could be because I was openly advocating for female empowerment on social media a lot recently or that I couldn't see him in the dark and thought it was someone else. maybe an incel like him gets butthurt by these things.

When our friend(nongroper/activist) came back with our pack of cigarettes, we decided to tell him what had happened because he might know how to handle the situation better. I was pretty angry. I wanted to beat the guy up. I didn't even want to confront him or anything I just wanted to straight up beat the shit out of him.
Our friend managed to convince me to confront him instead. 

I was pretty hesitant at first but eventually when it came down to it my anger took over. I was extremely confrontational. It was still pretty fresh and I could still feel it on me where he had groped me. 

He denied the situation completely. At first he told us that when we came upstairs he hugged us and then went straight to talk to my husband. He completely tried to deny the fact that he even came up to me and sat there first. 
Then he changed up his story when I confronted him about that bit. He even said that he was holding his phone with both hands and that couldn't have possibly done it. I was getting more and more furious. His face showed complete innocence. If he didn't do what he did in such an obvious manner I might have doubted myself as well, I almost did.
I left the room fuming with anger and screaming things like ""pedo fucking dipshit""(because he kept dating underage girls for a long time)  at him and my cousin's mother ended up witnessing me being like that which is a big deal in this extremely conservative society. I didnt even know that she got out of her room.

Downstairs I was still pretty pissed off. I wanted to call my father who recently got out of jail and came to town and tell on him so he would get beaten up or something. 
Then my husband got mad at me. He pointed out that his cousin's mom saw me like that and that I should calm down. 
He was worried that this guy, who is affiliated with a lot of gangsters, might come after him if I sent my dad out to get him.

I know I wasn't thinking properly and I probably wouldn't have even called my dad but my husband got really pissed off at me. 
 
Before getting pissed off he just kept acting like he had to deal with this as if it was annoying. And then I told him to leave me alone and he hit me and got up and started screaming at me.

I don't know how to feel about this. Now he doesn't understand why I might not be too warm about it or I might be mad at him. He just tried to talk to me joking about something.

It feels pretty violating and this is affecting me pretty bad because this wasn't the first time. I lost my virginity to some idiot who took fifty shades of grey too seriously and not because I wanted to.

It doesn't help that my husband has gotten up from his seat bothering me about what I'm doing because he's worried I might ""do something stupid"" and acting victimized when I told him to leave me alone again. And the fact that before when he was really pissed he was screaming ""what the hell is wrong with you?!""

This isn't the first time I've just felt extremely let down. Sure, he does the dishes and cleans up. Can be really sweet majority of the time. But when it comes down to real situations he constantly fails me.

I don't know how to feel.",1533415698.0,XvXkittyXvX,TwoXChromosomes

Will I Ever Find Peace? [Trigger Warning][Support],"It's been 8 years. I still know his face, his words. It's the middle of the night again and I can't stop crying, holding a teddy bear older than me. Is it possible to ever ""get over it?"" I can't answer this question. I've gone through so much therapy but I don't understand why it still haunts me so much. I've never leaned on other survivors before.... I've never really leaned on anyone before because people don't really understand and they can't do anything for you. I feel like I have a boot pressing on my chest and I can't get it off. I can't remember what it was like to not be scared. I watch women empowerment movies and the main characters remind me of a ghost, of a girl I used to know. It hurts to remember who I was before everything. And I try so hard to be ok. Because goddamn it's almost been a decade and I can't hold myself together most days. It's not living. It's surviving. Barely. Holding down a job is a miracle. Getting along with people feels like a monumental accomplishment. And so much hatred rests in my battered heart. 
why does it hurt SO much? Why does it completely strip your identity away and rob you of key elements of yourself that made you feel whole? I really miss me. I really miss who I was. And people tell me that i still wouldn't be that girl today but who the fuck gets to tell me who I would have been?! I was robbed of ever getting to know... I'm still alive and breathing.. I feel bad that I'm not grateful enough for that? I feel bad that I'm sick and that only makes the hole deeper and bigger. I feel guilty and I can't make it stop because I shouldn't be sorry for any of it. I didn't do anything other than be a bright person in a dark place and I was targeted for it.

My friend tried to convince me not to join a girl's group.,"A local orginization for teenage girls has started a ""Girl's Empowerment Group"" in my school. I was given a letter asking me to join and a permission slip a little before winter break. I had this conversation when I told my (male) friend.

Him: Oh god, don't go. That's a well known feminist group.

Me: What does that have to do with anything?

Him:No, they're crazy feminist. They arrested a guy for looking at their members. They said it was rape.

He reads the letter.

Him: Wait, girls 13 to 18? Am I the only one who finds this extremely creepy?

Me: How?

Him: That stuff doesn't happen in high school.

Me: It doesn't say anything about ""that stuff"", it just says girl's empowerment.
 
Him: Come in, we know that just means anti-rape class.

I storm away at that point. Later I said I wasn't mad at him (I know that was dumb but I don't like holding grudges) and we've been back to normal. I researched the organization and there are no sources of the rape accusations he mentioned, and all I could find for it was praise. Since then I've said yes to the offer and gotten my permission slip signed but I haven't said anything about it to him. The meetings will take place at a period him and I don't have together so I think I could hide it from him, which I want to do because I don't want a fight. 

I think this is just a rant, maybe asking for advice on what to do. I can't believe some of the things he's said. ""That's a well known feminist group."", as if it explained everything. ""That stuff doesn't happen in high school"" and ""We know that just means anti-rape class."" He claims to not have anything against feminists, only the really out-of-control man-hating ones, but I'm starting to doubt that. So, any advice?

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments, I know I wasn't being super brave or confident (I'm not really a brave or confident person). Anyway, I told him I was going. He didn't say anything, just gave a sort of ""God, this idiot"" face and changed the subject. I have a feeling the topic is going to come up again when I have to go to the first meeting (next week) but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

I'm a guy and I use the word studette and I want your opinion.,"The sexual double standard that everyone with half a brain and an iota of decency recognizes a female being a slut is exactly the same as a male being a stud. The disparity in connotations between the two words for the same activity has ALWAYS made me uncomfortable. I have never come across a word that describes feminine empowerment around sex, other than chastity purity etc.

Much as there is a bachelorette to a bachelor, I decided to use studette to stud.

What is your take on this. Think of the times you have felt bad about yourself as a sexual being and try applying the word studette to describe the fact you think sex is great. When someone has called you a slut, what if they called you a studette?

I honestly hope this catches on. The most interesting girls I know are the ones that are confidant in themselves, and part of that is commanding the fact we are all very sexual beings, and in my opinion, the studette connotations help, rather than hinder this.",1314195315.0,companiondanger,TwoXChromosomes
Women as force for development in Iran,">""The [Iranian] government’s policies such as increasing public education, particularly for girls, the
establishment of the health network system, and the increase in access to electricity and safe water,
transport and communication in remote areas of Iran have all are likely to have had an indirect effect on
fertility decline. High aspirations and investments by families in their children’s schooling have also
affected couples’ fertility decision making. Iranian girls and women stay more years in school and
university than was the case previously and this factor delays marriage and childbearing. The sex ratio of
the university students has changed in favour of girls over the last few years. In 1998, around 52 per cent
of university candidates who were admitted to government universities were girls. The figure increased to
57 per cent in 1999, to around 60 per cent in 2000, and then to around 62 percent in 2001 (Abdollahyan,
2001). This has had a considerable impact on the improvement of the status of women and is, indeed, a
central feature of social change in the society. Girls are staying in education longer; delaying their
marriage, and this will affect their fertility decision-makings. Shadi-Talab (2001) in her study on Iranian
Women: Rising Expectations concluded that “Iranian women are moving towards convergence in basic
gender sensitive values. … The main part of these reforms is the result of girls’ empowerment through
higher education from different socio-economic backgrounds. **Therefore, Iranian women with rising
expectations are an accelerating force of development in Iran”.**

>Furthermore, the official program introduced by the government in 1989 enjoyed the support of
religious leaders. It should be noted that some religious leaders were opposed to the first family planning
program implemented before the revolution. However, Ayatollah Khomeini issued the first approval for
the use of family planning methods in 1979. Despite this, the family planning program was suspended
after the revolution, but studies have shown that family planning services were available through clinics
during the early 1980s (Mehryar and others, 2001). The support of religious leaders in the late 1980s
legitimized the family planning program, and the government provided family planning services to people
without any religious barriers.

>The decline in infant mortality was also a very important factor in the demand for fewer births and
a smaller family size. The infant mortality rate declined from around 114 per 1000 live births in 1975 to
64 per 1000 in 1985, and 34 in 1994. The establishment of the health network system and its extension to
rural and deprived areas of the country has been one of the key factors in reducing infant mortality.
Urbanization has also contributed to the decline as, by 1996, more than 60 per cent of the population, were
living in urban areas.

I've been studying gender stereotypes in RMPS and this question came up in. I've been thinking about it for a while now and I've realised I just don't know. Which is pretty bad, seeing as I am a sixteen year old girl. I feel like I should know what feminism is, what empowerment of women is etc. I've always thought of it as something from the past, like the Suffragists.

I got to speak with Gloria Steinem today.,"proof: http://distilleryimage9.instagram.com/6be1d7e48f0b11e1abd61231381b6d77_7.jpg


My high school has a class that was developed a few years ago called Women’s Studies. Now, I was never in it, but the teacher is a fantastic woman who’s just all kinds of driven and empowering. But one of her students, after doing a unit on leaders of the feminist movement, decided that it would be awesome to try and have Gloria Steinem speak to the class. Now, like a good deal of famous people, she has something of a high speaking fee that the local high school couldn’t really afford. But after months of communication, the student and Gloria’s agency folks negotiated to waive any fee and have a half-hour Skype session with her.

A high school student arranged this! Classic example of “you never know until you try.”

Anyway, myself and three other ladies I went to high school with found out about this event via Facebook from the teacher in question, and we were all invited. Three of them were in the class, but I asked to go since women’s healthcare is my profession and I’m a nice loud feminist myself.

So we got into this class, said our hellos and met the future generation of enlightened women. All seniors in high school, and all vastly excited. The nervous energy was intense. The room was set up like a movie theater, a webcam atop the smartboard and optimum viewing locations were filled with seats.

She called us at 1:45 and we all applauded. And to be honest, me and the three ladies I was sitting with in the very back row actually had tears in our eyes. To see the smiling, ageless (seriously, she’s 78 and really DOESN’T look it) face of a woman who carried a movement with her powerful words from pen and mouth…it was pretty overwhelming.

The half hour session was for us to ask questions to her…and I did have my opportunity. I introduced myself and wore my bright pink “I Stand With Planned Parenthood” t-shirt that she noticed and approved of. I thanked her for paving the way for women like us but I asked her…Why the resurgence in this war against women? What brought it back to the spotlight after all these decades of (relative) peace?

She had such an eloquent answer, but I’ll sum it up thus; The extremist minority is attempting to control one of two very big parties. And as society changes, we become more diverse. Diversity is halted when the reproductive population gets controlled, and that won’t allow the cultural and racial minorities to eventually become the national majority. The extremists are losing. They are grasping at straws in trying to maintain this old idea of white-middle-to-high-class-man rules all and it’s the last act of a dying breed.

God, what an answer. Agree or disagree, it gives me hope.

Another girl asked her how she managed to look as fantastic as she does—and she meant it honestly. Ms. Steinem’s answer was simple. Do what you love, because it takes years of undue stress away.

My friend asked her if she believed that feminism was still a battle to be faced today, should women still be adopting the title? Another fantastic answer: the battle has really only just begun for us because as we’ve moved on into the working world, the most basic fight for payment equality hasn’t been realized. Something that basic, what should be common sense—-that shows us just how much we still need to fight for the true and honest equality that we as women strive for.

The room changed when she was speaking. A few men, faculty and students, sat and paid rapt attention. No one took out their cell phones to text during her talk with us; all eyes stayed on her as everyone actually listened. The high school girls sat up straighter, they spoke clearer and more direct…they were empowered by her, validated by her and it felt like the thread of generations stretched out into the room and connected us all in this one common theme. (It sounds cheesy, but it’s been so long since I’ve seen people disconnect from their cell phones and actually /hear/ someone.)

Ms. Steinem was not condescending, she treated everyone she interacted with like an equal. She was eloquent and self-deprecating and honest. She laughed, smiled and waved as us who introduced ourselves. She loved the “T-Ro [Theodore Roosevelt] was a feminist” t-shirts the class was wearing as a group to speak with her. Simply put, she is just as human as the rest of us, and that’s what made this so powerful.

When it was time to say goodbye there was applause and waving. As the room cleared out, a few of us needed to have a seat and really just take a minute to recover. We had received such a lesson in feminism, empowerment and in our own personal lives that it actually needed to process. I spent the rest of the day and even now I feel so completely renewed in my passion to help women.

This was probably one of the greatest things I’ve ever gotten to experience, and I just really wanted to share it with you all.",1335414976.0,LadyJaneKillington,TwoXChromosomes
"TIL there is a Girl Scout badge called ""Eating for Beauty."" I'm disturbed.","Other badges I found rather appalling were some of the science-related ones, which had little to do with actual science, such as ""Home Scientist"", ""Science of Style"", and ""Science of Happiness."" Oh, and let's not forget the ""Dinner Party"", ""Social Butterfly,"" or the ""Savvy Shopper"" badges. I don't even know what to think about the ""Household Elf"" badge (what does that even mean??) Sure, there are some legit ones, too, of course, but these were glaring. Check them out yourself at http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/list/

As someone who was a Girl Scout as well as in a sorority, I have seen both sides of the girl empowerment issue, and I personally believe that separate is not equal. I believe boys and girls, men and women need to be encouraged to spend time together so they can learn to better understand each other and see each other as human beings. After all, if you grow up surrounded by only one sex with all these ideas of how you, your same sex, and the opposite sex are supposed to act, good luck with school, work, and family, all of which are rife with a mixture of both.

Edit: I wanted to see what kind of response I would get if I voiced my concerns to the GSUSA, but I got a pretty generic response:   

Dear [my name],
Thank you for your comments. The Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting has been
very well-received by girls, volunteers, and parents.  Please know that
the content for Skill-Building and Legacy badges in The Girl's Guide to
Girl Scouting was developed with research that included feedback from
girls across the country and within all program levels. 

Thank you for contacting Girl Scouts of the USA.
Sincerely,
The Program Team

Here's my deal with the research aspect. I do not doubt that they surveyed girls all over the country to discover their interests, and I do not doubt that the majority of girls wanted to learn about nutritional aspects in relation to beauty. However, I do not think being attractive is something girls are interested in because of internal motivation; I think it's very external. Western culture has a terrible track record in this area, and I thought organizations, especially ones for girls, were more mindful of the subtle (and not so subtle) language and expectations in our culture.",1319760301.0,hflldjts258,TwoXChromosomes

Feminist critiques of various films in 50 or fewer words. Add yours.,"**Revenge of the Nerds** (1984) Victims of bullying gain empowerment, girlfriends and popularity through a gradual transformation into repulsive sexual predators. 

**Twilight** (2008) Bella Swan, a klutzy outsider disappointed by her recent move to her father's home in a dull small town, finds her confidence--for values of ""confidence"" that mean ""much older, dominant man who ensures she's too busy trying to survive to bother about things like developing an independent identity or continuing her education.""

**The Last Airbender** (2010) White people ape Asian culture and fight scary brown people. An extensive cast of extras serves to strengthen the film's message; namely, non-whites make excellent scenery, but poor leads.

(Ok, that one wasn't really a feminist critique)

**John Tucker Must Die** (2006) Cheated-on girlfriends band together to take revenge on their ex in the worst way possible--by giving him female hormones, turning him into the only thing worse than a narcissistic serial cheater: A woman. Well, okay, just a man with female hormones. Full womanhood would be *too* cruel.

**300** (2006) Frightening, deformed, dark-skinned sexual deviants attack an idyllic Sparta, where women are free to seduce and manipulate men at will. Actual history, in which 37% of Spartans were slaves and free men were permitted to kill a few each year to show them their place, need not apply.

**Shallow Hal** (2001) A man is subjected to a heinous punishment for his shallow behavior: He's tricked into dating and even having sex with a 300-pound woman. After the hypnosis is removed, he is disgusted by his girlfriend but later graciously offers to take her back; she agrees, since as a fat girl the best she'll ever do is a guy who fell for her because he was under hypnosis.

**Crank** (2006) A man who must keep his adrenaline levels up in order to stay alive discovers that raping your girlfriend in public results in her magical transformation into a screaming and delighted, enthusiastic partner.

**Pretty Woman** (1990) Slut is saved from herself by a wealthy man. After being subjected to numerous humiliations including (gasp) being barred from purchasing overpriced clothes, she is lucky enough to trade her life of exchanging her body for currency for a life of exchanging her body for marriage to a rich guy.

**The Matrix** (1999) Strong woman discovers that she's been chosen for a special, supernatural, world-saving destiny... to fall in love with the clearly much more important male protagonist and defend his interests with her life.

**Sex and the City 2** (2010) Strong female leads discover that as they age, they'd really rather become, respectively, a vacuous ""cougar"" engaged in an expensive grudge match against her own body, and a stay-at-home wife and mother, since a job was too hard for hubby to handle. The other two characters were shallow enough already.

**The Devil Wears Prada** (2006) Young woman who remembers to ""keep sweet"" triumphs over evil boss who helpfully reminds audience that women can't *really* have both a successful career and a happy family, and if they appear to have both it's probably all a front covering up a tragic personal life and various neuroses.",1279566914.0,LadyOnion,TwoXChromosomes
I was paid to perform a cam show and I loved everything about it. ,"Ok so the title pretty much explains it. 

I am a 23 year old female. An aquaintance of mine continuously lusted after me. I was always in a relationship and he was never really my type for anything long-term. I found myself single and flirtacious. We chatted and he asked if I could put on a cam show for him. I joked that it would cost him. He replied, how much?! I threw out a number and within minutes a money transfer appeared in my e-mail inbox. 

I must admit, I fell in love with this idea. I have always been sexually open and, at times, promiscuous. I love my body and loved that he wanted to see my body so badly he was willing to pay. I loved the extra cash I had to buy those cute pair of sunglasses. I loved that I was safe and in my own home. I felt an odd empowerment afterwards. 

This happened months ago and I only recently began thinking about it because I've been propositioned again. Like I said, I'm very flirty and a friend of mine (fairly close this time, we have fooled around together before) has asked if he could also pay for a cam show. Now, I have always been interested in the sex industry as employment, from sex stores to phone chat workers. I've been told by many that I would make an excellent phone-sex girl. A friend of mine used to narrate pornography for the blind and unfortunately we no longer speak but this is also something I'm very interested in. 

So, 2X, let's talk about it. Do you agree? disagree? What are you opinions about girls who perform on camera solo? 

I want to make very clear that this is in no way about prostitution or any form of exchanging sexual acts with someone for money.

Where are the men that have healthy relationships with their penises!??,"(And also with women, and sex in general!)

**[Title is rhetorical and I am *really* not seeking a show of hands from men in this sub who want to announce what a good guy they are!]**

Men my age-ish (mid-late 20's) seem to come with 2 factory settings:

Setting 1- Addicted to pornography and beating their meat to the extent that you'll be lucky if they ever let go of it to spend time with you, and all their money goes to random women's ""spicey pages"" before they'll ever think of getting you flowers. And don't bank on them being able to get an erection for a real-life woman because you'll just find their phone balanced on your back during doggy.

or, Setting 2- They are staunchly against masturbating because it is 'dirty' and below them, or they don't like doing it/it makes them depressed afterward. They still expect to cum though, but its your job to make it happen if you want any peace that day. And I can almost guaran-fucking-tee he'll tell you his love language is 'physical touch', but no matter how much cuddling, hand-holding, or shoulder rubs you offer, he'll still insist, ""but-but.. sex is how I feel most loved by you 🥺"". Even if he's been a complete asshole and argued with you all day.
(Well shit, direct deposits of $10,000 make me feel most loved... 🙄)

Maybe its just because I've recently left a long-term relationship with a man from the second category, but I am so very sick of men making everything so sex-centered! Dating feels like being a sentient fleshlight just trying to find a nice home to go to! The thought of a man hugging me makes my bloodpressure spike because I can't imagine it being without the expectation of sex.

I find myself becoming very angry at cishet men lately, both irl and online, when they want to discuss their 'relationship problems' and its literally ""shes funny, kind, smart, loyal, beautiful, she makes serious bank in a career shes passionate about, loves spending time with me, and always listens to my problems... but man, she won't put out every day and its got me real sad. How can I convince her to have more sex?""

Never once have I rolled into a marginalized group of any kind and asked them to focus on my pain.

Edit: thanks for the RedditCares award, anonymous redditor! Jokes on you. I haven’t blocked that because I get off on wounding fragile male egos.

Edit2: *sigh* Men. Yes…”masculinity” and its many toxic manifestations hurt men too. Women have been yelling that into the void for decades. Unfortunately women also live in a world hell bent on keeping us small…we don’t have power to save you from your pain. We are already running faster and harder at school and in our careers and what we do is never enough and we can’t be angry and we can’t not smile and we sure as hell can’t tell cis white straight men about our pain and some of us are literally dying because because men with no understanding of basic female anatomy decided, against the guidelines of EVERY (non-catholic/evangelical) medical institution, that the STATE should control our bodies. We don’t even have emotional vacancy for this. What are YOU doing? That’s the real question. If you aren’t aligning yourself with feminism and calling out other men (rather you’re here, hollering to us), see yourself out. *edited this edit to sound less harsh after my morning coffee — there are some men who are driving real change and I implied a disregard for them that I don’t fundamentally believe in (even if this is a sub for women about women). I’ll personally march alongside a true ally of any gender any day. My heart is open to the underdogs of this world.",1667401541.0,Ok_Crew_3620,TwoXChromosomes
Apparently I ruined dinner last night because I used whole grain noodles instead of the regular kind,"Posting here because I would like advice from other women. I don’t want advice from men on this matter. 

Last night was really hard and has me seriously rethinking my relationship. 

I decided to make spaghetti, using whole grain noodles instead of the regular kind. My fiancé was pacing around while talking otp with his mom. He came in the kitchen and read the package the noodles were in. He asked his mom if she ever used whole grain noodles, and then he looked annoyed but still tried keeping a good mood with her.. 

When he got off the phone he asked why I got whole grain noodles and said “oh you’re in one of your healthy phases again… I told you not to include me in your shit” the crazy part is this isn’t my first time using them, just the first time he noticed! And when I told him that he got quiet and then said he would give it a try. 

Well he tried it and didn’t like it. He was mad that there weren’t any other leftovers to fall back on, and that’s his own damn fault because he’s been eating every single thing. He’s stayed home this entire week due to a back injury, and has been eating a lot and he’s been crankier than usual. So the fact that there wasn’t anything else cooked for him to eat, he said I ruined dinner. 

I told him to go get fast food or something. He got up and started yelling at me that I was making things harder for him. I told him I understood that he was hurting but I wasn’t taking the fault for it. I tried getting up and he grabbed my shoulder and sorta pushed me back down. I looked at his hand and asked wtf he was doing. He got in my face and told me I knew what I was doing and that I was being a bitch. He said it in the calmest tone which made it hurt worse for some reason. 

He started limping to the living room and I followed him telling him to change his tune and I just let everything out that I had build up from this week. He walked to the kitchen and threw the spaghetti in the trash. I looked at him just shocked that he would do that. He looked at me and nodded like he acknowledged that I was upset. I sorta shoved him and he fell over. It wasn’t a hard shove, I just wanted him to stop. He turned dramatic and said “so you’re going to do this while I’m injured, I see the type of person you are” and he tripped me. We were both on the floor and he grabbed my hair with both of his hands. I kept hitting him to let me go and he slapped me across the face and walked outside to his car. 

Idk how long he was gone but when he came back I was still sitting in the same spot. He tried being nice and begged me to get in bed with him. I was like are you fucking serious rn? He looked at my face and said “do you see my face and what you did to me? It was never that serious!” He had nothing wrong with his face because I never hit his face. I was hitting his arms and gripping them with my nails so he would let me go. 

I feel like shit because I actually went to bed with him and let him wrap his arms around me. Anytime I moved he gripped tighter like he was afraid that I would leave. 

This morning he got up and left. I’m still stuck. ",1725719982.0,throwaway427905,TwoXChromosomes

The men's loneliness epidemic is not going to be solved by women,"I get this feeling that every time it is raised, the perception is that the solution lies with women. This is despite men admitting that they struggle to make and maintain friendships after school, they don't open up to their male friends, and struggle to be emotionally vulnerable and open. 

It seems that some perceive the problem being that the role of friend and person to open up to was taken completely by the romantic partners in their lives, and want this to continue. Women performed this unpaid labour, and men got so comfortable with that, that they never really saw the purpose is having a network of close friends to turn to.

As more women enter the workforce and gain the right to vote, marriage is no longer a necessity for survival. Women now have choices. I have noticed these choices being criticized, ""Dating apps give women too many options and they don't want to settle!"".

And this is true. Women now want more than just a partner for the sake of having one. They want compatability. They want someone who sees them as an equal, who is willing to share the mental, emotional and domestic load. They want someone who they are attracted to, and doesn't feel entitled to sex.

Women are also more likely to put in work to maintain friendships and our social lives. I am introvert and have social anxiety. If I could, I would almost never leave the house. But I do work at being social and maintaining friendships because they are important to me, and it just isn't healthy being that isolated. 

Once you are an adult, part of being an adult means acknowledging that you get a lot of freedoms because society assumes you can handle adult responsibilities. And that includes working to resolve the problems in your life. Some problems are big enough that they do need societal intervention, but one also has to acknowledge that sometimes the work needs to start with you.

As someone who has struggled with making friends (I suck at small talk and am very quiet), I do emphasize. It is incredibly lonely and isolating knowing you have a lot of problems and stress, and no one to turn to, especially if you move to new city or town. However, I made the effort to go out of my comfort zone. It took a lot of failed efforts, but slowly but surely I did manage to make new friends.  And once I made these friends, I got introduced to their friends, and so on. If I got invited to an event, I would go even if I was feeling lazy that weekend. I would host small get together at my place. I joined clubs, went to MeetUp events. Reached out to old friends and classmates on Facebook.

I think the age of women as romantic partners being the primary person that men offload their problems to is coming to an end. In the past, I would do this only to find the man rarely if ever asked about me or my problems. I was just convenient to talk to, but he didn't really see it as a two way street.

The solution to end this epidemic needs to start with men, and I worry that they don't realize this.

Edit: Unpaid labour refers to having one person behaving as a therapist for another person. I have gone to therapy. It involves me spending the entire hour talking about myself and my problems. And I get to do that because I pay her. I don't mean general, normal sharing of problems. That happens and should happen in many friendships and relationships. I should have been more clear. I meant situations where a person uses their partner to vent to without reciprocating. They rarely ask how their partner or friends are doing, check in on them, etc. It's the one sided nature of it that makes it labour.

Edit 2: I find it interesting how some men in the comments are saying this isn't just a men's loneliness epidemic, and that it affects everyone. Yet prior to this, every time women tried to point out that women get lonely and depressed too, and that if they are lonely or single, it is 100% their choice. Now all of a sudden women are also affected. Why was discussion of this shut down before? Or are they only saying that now because they are trying to backtrack, realizing by framing it as men's only, they were not going to get women involved?

Also, many women (but not all) have indeed made a conscious decision to rather be alone than be in an unhappy relationships or one-sided relationships where the effort involved is heavily skewed to one partner, usually them. Women are also choosing where to invest their time and efforts with regard to friendships, and are learning to avoid one sided friendships where they make all the effort. Therefore women *know* this makes men more lonely. It's not by accident. It's by design. It's our way of saying: step up, because we can survive and thrive without you.

Edit 3: Men coming here and complaining: this is a predominantly women's space. Are we no longer allowed to vent? Or do you want to control our thoughts and how we react to things? Damn, you make it sound like I went into a men's only space where you were pouring your hearts out and I derailed you. I didn't. I came here to vent and discuss it with other women (and men who are open to the discussion).",1711957066.0,Aromatic-Frosting-75,TwoXChromosomes
"Don't set a boundary, or you'll never be shown affection again....","I've noticed a trend lately, usually but not exclusively aimed at women, of people being told to accept whatever they are given, or risk not being given anything. 

Recent examples: a man who bought lingerie for his wife's birthday in the wrong size, which made her unhappy, and highly upvoted advice is to never buy her clothes again.

A man asking his wife to compliment him less because it cheapens the compliment for him, being told to accept it or she'll never compliment him ever again. 

A comment mentioning that a wife who asked to be touched less now has to endure never being touched at all, with the attitude that she deserves what she gets. 

This is *unhealthy*. A healthy, rational human being who cares for someone hears the boundary and adjusts accordingly, rather than just taking their ball and going home. 

Is having a healthy relationship this hopeless? Is this why I can't feel connected to anyone, because I have boundaries? Are people not allowed to be touched out, or hurt by being objectified? Talk some sense, please? ",1726643932.0,AnalogyAddict,TwoXChromosomes
Living with the wrong man makes you ugly.,"I looked through my photos and I was shocked of what I found

I'm living with my soon to be ex of 5 years. 
The relashionship progressed into him being completely selfish and putting more and more onto me. 

When I found a photo of me prior to the relationship, I was shocked. Considerably thinner and fitter, I loved makup and doing my hair. I did my makeup almost every day, a lot of bold ones too (a lot of colours and glitter). **I was a fucking bombshell**.

I can see it in the timeline of the photos, how DONE I started to look.
First three years, less experiments with my hair and make up, but still cute. Last two years, weight gain, no makup, skin is significantly worse. I always struggled with flucuating weight, but never was so heavy like now. Its not only that I look swollen and puffy somehow?

The lack of sleep (yes he wakes me up often), the lack of time for myself, the physical and mental labour. The stress. It's mentally draining. I never thought it was THAT visible.

So ladys watch out for yourself, they will make you ugly.

Note: I know weight does not make you ugly or not. Read it in context please. I mean looking unhealthy, puffy, stressed and done. I don't care for weight, there are a lot of cury girls out therethat look vibrant and amazing. But I put a effort in myself - healthy diet and staying fit. Not doing my makeup does not make me ugly but its visible that I look not put together or like I care for myself **eventhough I had a lot of fun doing it**. I  stopped taking time for it. I stopped putting time in myself.


Edit: Someone pointed something out about ""men aging better"" and I did not realize this, but he looks so much better now! You can see how he gained weight (he was underweight), looks fresh and somehow younger in pictures eventhough he started to get grey hairs pretty soon. Of course I had a lot of input in his nice clothes and a nice haircut. A picture of the begining of the relashionship to now and he honestly went from a tired 4 to and fresh 9.

Seems pretty nice to put all your emotional baggage and physical labour on someone else! They really get too many benefits holy shit!",1722791102.0,RoleIll7269,TwoXChromosomes
"Forget 6'5, blue eyed men in finance.","Can we make a calculator for what most women *actually* want/need in a man?

🟢 Not a sex / porn addict (or other addict)

🟢 Moderate, healthy lifestyle 

🟢 Loyal, won't leave when we're old/sick

🟢 Still makes us feel beautiful and secure after bearing children and aging

🟢 Kind, generous, thoughtful 

🟢 Tries really hard to keep promises 

🟢 Willing to compromise 

🟢 Educated enough to show a hint of ambition in life

🟢 Financially responsible 

🟢 Present and active in childcare

🟢 Will do chores unprompted (doesn't contribute to mental load)

🟢 Secure in their hobbies and passions

Everything else would just be a bonus. Why is *this* ☝️ so damn hard to find??


Edit: there's too many comments for me now to reply, but I have a few things to add:

The calculator comment is a reference to the ""calculator"" that already exists to find % of men of a certain height, income, etc.

For the men getting butthurt about me listing basic expectations of kindness and respect your partner, I imagine you're most upset about #1. Whatever one feels about porn, if it impacts your sex life, arousal and attraction to your partner, it's a detriment to a relationship. If you're upset about anything else on the list perhaps you should look inward and inspect your own behavior and habits, because nothing I listed was about looks. My point was that the vast, *vast* majority of women aren't as shallow as the memey song going around implies (which the title of this post references).

A ""moderate, healthy lifestyle"" looks different for everyone and is a bit more subjective. For me that's having some activity in ones life, whether a hobby or sport, and maybe not getting McDonald's more than a few times a week. It differs for everyone, but caring for your health is attractive. 

For the education part I do agree I worded it poorly and I don't feel formal academic training is any reflection of ambition level necessarily. As others have said, some other indication of ambition (trade school, entrepreneurship, whatever) is attractive and desirable in a partner. 

To those saying Financially responsible must mean rich, I'm not sure what you're on about. If he's spending money on nonessentials when the family's in debt, that's not responsible. It has nothing to do with wealth.

Also - *obviously, of course, I can't believe it has to be said,* but these standards of basic decency should be expected of women too.",1717084777.0,gotta_bee_ambitious,TwoXChromosomes
He told me THE reason he was voting split ticket this U.S. election cycle.,"We've been dating for a few years. It's difficult for him to open up, and he is allergic to conflict (yet strangely, not commitment.) We are on the same page on basically everything in life, or so I thought.

I am not pleased with either political offering, but one is very clearly better than the other. So I jokingly asked if he was ""excited"" (very sarcistically) to vote for Kamala Harris, since he said he got his ballot in the mail. He sighed and said he was glad that he didn't have to vote for Trump, but that he'd still be voting split ticket. My heart skipped a beat and I asked, ""what do you mean."" Abortion is in the ballot. What?

And then he tried to explain to me what voting a split ticket *is* and I cut him off, saying I know what the fuck it is ---*why* the fuck are you doing that? Because in July before Biden dropped out of the race, I had a mini-panic attack about the state of things and surviving a second Trump presidency. He sat with me for about 2 hours as I bubblered on about how scared I am for myself and *every other decent human being on the planet,* because unfortunately, the U.S. is a political powerhouse and what happens here *deeply* affects other countries. At the time he calmed me down and asked if there was anything he could do to help, we talked at length, etc.

So when I asked him if saying he was voting split ticket was supposed to be a joke...and I asked why. He said:

>**the only reason I am voting for Kamala Harris is because I don't currently make enough money to make voting for Trump worth it.**

I am CIS female, and white passing--but he's a visibile minority. The Republicans *will* come for Loving, and then we could never get married. I have trans friends and family members. He has been in relationships *with* trans women. What about them? Etc. And he thought about it for a while before saying, ""I never claimed to be a good person, I tell you all the time what an awful person I am. I am inheriently selfish. And when presented with the lesser of two evils or the greater good, I will always vote for what benefits me the most, and what benefits others second."" With the only occasional (not even always, just *occasional*) exception being climate change. This is a man who dates trans women. But he doesn't want them (or apparently anyone else????) to have a leg to stand on?

He makes 6 figures. I have never made 6 figures. I have had to take advantage of those social welfare systems the Republican party wants to destroy. I am a minority that they would rather do away with, even if I pass whiteness on the visual scale. I asked him, if I could prove to him that a direct vote for any Republican is condemning both of us, if it would change his mind. He said no because eventually he's going to be making so much money that he will vote for whatever keeps him from having to pay taxes. Eventually he will make so much money that he'll be one of the ""exceptions"" for the laws. And that his vote ensures that he can take care of whatever I need, too. This made me very angry. Because as I told him, ""cool, you'll have enough money to take care of just me. What about everyone else? What the fuck are my rights to existence if you die? My quality of life will be predicated on *your* income because *you* voted to have the systems that way? You don't see the problem with this?"" And he looked sheepish but basically shrugged in a way that told me, ""*yeah, I guess those are the facts.""*

I told him, very plainly, that typically people who make selfish decisions like that, especially when people they supposedly love and care about say, ""your vote is actively going to hurt me"", typically do *not* care about their partners. I asked him if he could even imagine a circumstance where he picked my needs before his own, since he had said that thing about selfishness. He gave me two examples of times he genuinely was selfless towards, but outside of me he has never done a selfless act.........dude. *This* is your moral compass?

I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""thank you for being honest. That takes a lot of courage to do."" And then I told him that I loved him, but I needed to go home.

This was someone I was supposed to move in with before the end of the year. I'm in a stable, but not-so-great home situation at the moment that I was looking forward to getting out of. I don't want to be in a relationship just to put a roof over my head, but I have barely been able to sleep since he told me this. I don't want to break up with him but it just feels like a fundamental difference that I have no idea if I can get over. I'm not interested in trying to change his mind. I just wish I understood how he could sit through my emotional melt downs every other time for hours and literally never complain about it and be a good partner in literally every other way....until this conversation.

I'm not asking how to repair this relationship, I'm asking what the fuck I am supposed to do when the guy who has treated me the best out of any relationship in my entire life (my THERAPIST fucking approved this guy) is *also* like this, when it *really really reallllllyyy* matters. What the fuck do I even do now. 

  
**editing for multiple points of clarity:**  



>  
Why didn't you believe him when he called himself selfish? 

Because this was over things like ""hey I ate the last of the leftovers"" or ""I forgot to do that thing you asked me to do because I was excited about XYZ."" Things *every actually reasonable human being has a jokingly said they are selfish for doing* ***not*** *for a difference in human rights.* Asking someone to read into every innocuous comment when their partner has had no red flags up to that point is something.   


>Why are you still with him? 

Never said I was! I was asking for clarification on how to avoid men who spend entire years with the mask up, but this is continously being glossed over and people are assuming I'm staying with him. I'm not. I am lamenting the time wasted on someone who was acting like they gave a shit and asking what the fuck else I am supposed to do when even my therapist thinks he's okay enough for me to trust. 



>Your therapist shouldn't be ""approving people"" 

  
All I meant by this comment was that I've been working with my therapist for many years, and that we both agree that this *was* (emphasis on the past tense here) a healthy relationship in comparison to everything else, and that I had been doing a good job using my skills that I learned in therapy to navigate this relationship.

UPDATE: I’ve realized I have lost all respect for willful ignorance and it may damage my marriage.,"Thank you to all who commented.

UPDATE: We had a serious discuss. I went into more details about my concerns and fears and it was… intense. I was much better at presenting the case. I gave him several hypotheticals that involved a particularly gruesome set of circumstances involving his ballsac ( 😬). I won’t bore you with the nitty gritty but the gist was to shift his perspective. I told him to seriously consider carrying a tiny fetus in his ball sac and the fact that the risk were things like Exploding Balls, Sepsis, etc and the myriad of ways he could end up dead, permanently physically injured and disfigured, or unable to produce a fetus in the future if he didn’t have the option of removing the fetus from his ballsac. I asked him if he would even want to take the risk and he agreed that he’d be very likely to remove it unless he was ready for those risks. I asked him why in the world would I be justified in telling him he HAS to carry it no matter what and it *might* only be removed after it starts to explode out of his ballsac or his organs start shutting down… etc.

 Once he seemed to start grasping the enormity of what abortion encompasses and seeing why it’s very important to not let unknown people control what options you have with no medical reason… I told him I lost a bit of respect for willful ignorance (and that I can tell he avoided thinking about it bc he knows in some way that it says something about his character) and I RESENTED having to even give him a hypothetical in the first place and that if he cares for me and our daughter that he should automatically actively be using his empathy skills every day. I explained how I have demonstrated the capacity to care about and evaluate gender issues he’s brought to my attention in the past. That was a… difficult part of the conversation. I also told him that I do not trust him to always make good decisions for us and that I feel alone in my shouldering of those responsibilities.

He listened and let me talk a lot. He asked if I was going to leave him and he was clearly nervous and bracing for the worst. I told him I’m not taking drastic steps like that but I certainly will when it comes to keeping our daughter healthy and safe. I also started to say something about how I know I would lie to him in a heart beat in a situation where our daughter needed an abortion or medical care and he interrupted me to say “You wouldn’t have to lie because I’ll be driving the car or buying the plane tickets and we will all go anywhe we need to”. Y’all, I burst into tears.

We ended the conversation and he said I laid a lot on him and he needed a break but says he has things to think about. I didn’t push anymore politics but I think I feel like my trust has been slightly restored. I’m not getting my hopes up but I think he realizes that he’s wading in dark and dangerous waters when it comes to our futures. 

ORIGINAL POST:

I (33F) and my husband (37M) were having a discussion about politics and we got onto the topic of our daughter (7F) which led to me expressing my fears about her rights and bodily autonomy. 

*For context, my husband votes Republican and I have always considered myself independent but recently have been shifting very far away from my younger “carefree” attitude toward politics. I love him very much and I know for a fact that he loves me but I have started finding his opinions naive and lacking depth. He is a very good man though and has in the past changed his mind on several things when confronted with them. FURTHER context: my cousin lives in a strict anti-abortion state and almost died a few years ago when the doctors waited until she was actively dying of sepsis before they decided it was okay to remove the dead baby from her body even though it had been dead for weeks beforehand (so needless to say I had a wake-up call and sharpened up my principles until they are very shiny and pointy)*

Last night when we were talking about abortion rights being healthcare, I lost my composure out of sheer terror about the possibility of a similar disaster with my cousin happening to our daughter and how I struggle to understand how he doesn’t see the problem with his party and that in fact I think he is being willfully ignorant to the danger I and my daughter face in favor of his idea about making economics work for our family. I also said that if our daughter dies due to something preventable, like the ability to get a timely and much needed abortion or gets shot to death in school that I would let my own mother rot in a nursing home (she votes R too) and I’d never be able to look him in the face again which would basically be me disappearing and divorcing him.

I was crying and upset and explaining how scared I am and he asked me in a very hurt manner if I’d actually abandon him like that and I am truthful to a fault and said that I would, perhaps out of a sense of illogical grief and betrayal, because I’d know my concerns were not taken seriously and that they had abandoned common sense and did nothing to attempt preventing a very real consequence of voting away mine and my daughter’s right to healthcare. I equated it to a slow motion car wreck with our daughter in mortal danger and him just watching it happen bc it doesn’t involve his own body.

I know he needs to hear it. But I think I was too raw and open about it to steer the conversation in a healthy way and I have a very blunt manner. I apologized this morning for saying that I’d leave him, even though I know I would, and he tentatively accepted it. And I said we’d talk about things later when I can articulate things in a healthier way. But I’m at a loss as to how to make it known how deadly serious this is to me and not make him feel like I’d abandon our marriage over just any sensitive topic.

I do not need people telling me to leave him. I don’t think I know how to make it anymore digestible and be clear without going nuclear over something that has not happened as our daughter is too young to suffer that yet. The rub is that I am the person who is changing the dynamic of our relationship. And I am beginning to understand how politics breaks up families.",1720798564.0,ExistentialCrisisNo4,TwoXChromosomes
Advice on How to Say This to A Teenage Girl,"My teen son has his first serious girlfriend. She spends a lot of time at our house. I like her very much and think they have a healthy, respectful relationship.

The issue - I need to ask her not to flush tampons when she is at my house. 

We had to have a plumber out for some issues and he said the problem was flushed tampons and she is the only menstruating person who uses that bathroom. 

I do not want to embarrass her or make things awkward for her.

She and my son seem fairly open talking about periods. She tells him when she’s on her period and he keeps tampons and midol on a shelf in his bathroom for her. 

Should I just say something to her directly; have my son say something to her; say something to her mom and have her mom tell her? 

Am I just being silly and way overthinking this?

EDIT FOR MORE INFO - There is a trash can in the bathroom. We have no pets. Son has tried to think of everything she could need to keep the bathroom stocked for her. He has a shelf of tampons and pads, Midol, wipes, extra TP, and pays attention to when they need to be restocked and does it without her having to ask. He also keeps a bag of chocolate for her that no one else can touch.",1725727725.0,myshellly,TwoXChromosomes

My partner (M/28) broke up with me (F/28) because I refused to promise to stay within a healthy BMI in the future,"So as the title suggests, my ~5 year long partner broke up with me because I refused to promise him ‘to do everything in my power’ to stay within the normal BMI as long as we stay together (I am in a healthy weight range right now, but don’t have good genetics). He is generally acknowledging the fact that I would have gained weight during pregnancy/cies, but expects me to back to the normal weight/BMI thereafter.

His rationale is that 1) he wouldn’t be able to have sex with someone overweight and so would never be happy with anyone above the normal BMI; 2) if I care about our relationship, I should be able to understand that slimness is important to him and should be able to prioritise my fitness above other things (e.g. career). His expectation, for example, is that if I were to be offered a unique managerial opportunity, I should turn it down if taking it would mean that I no longer have time to exercise and fight my hypothetical extra weight.

My point of view is that I cannot promise to stay within the ‘normal’ weight/BMI because (a) life is so freaking unpredictable and there is literally a million reasons as to why a woman who works 10-11 hours a day and plans to have kids one day might struggle to keep off the extra weight; and (b) there are more important things/ priorities in life and keeping a model physique is not an end goal for me, but rather something ‘nice to have’.

I am completely heart-broken because I genuinely thought that I would be with this person long-term (we have been already trying to have kids and I was super excited about that).

Am I wrong here in not giving my partner that promise (which realistically I might not be able to keep and which goes against my personal values) at the expense of us breaking up?

UPD: 
* Thank you everyone for all your messages, support and points of view which I found very helpful. They definitely helped get through a pretty bad day.
** I did also receive dozens of messages from men asking me to prove that I’m not overweight / that I’m good-looking / that I’m ‘worthy of my ex’ / to send a pic to prove that (jesus, seriously) - if that was your response, you missed the point of post: there has been nothing wrong with my body/figure, but bf was just paranoid I might gain weight in the future.",1639391578.0,holmes_k,TwoXChromosomes
Pressure to change my healthy body ,"Prior to this year, I loved my body, I've worked out at least 5 days a week, for all of my twenties. My friends think I am dedicated. A few months ago my partner, told me he would prefer me to be skinnier than a size 4 USA / 8 UK/AUS. Even though I've always had an hourglass body and a flat stomach.

So, I've been going to the gym (worked out outside of the gym before) for 3 months, taking spin classes, learning to use weights, a lot of cardio and pilates and eat really clean, just one cheat meal a week and look incredible but he told me that's great but I want to see in one year. 

This isn't a just me thing, all of my friends in 20s and 30s have discovered that while 5 years ago men loved their bodies and their bodies are even fitter now, due to social media these men who don't have six packs are demanding they change their bodies to be loveable. 

I'll keep up my habits for me but refuse to not fuel my body properly and won't resort to dangerous measures, I like how strong and fit I feel but not a day goes by where I don't feel sad. It's like he's withholding love until I get even tinier in some ways, despite me being fitter than him. Him getting fired by his job, having no savings. While I invest, have my own business and people think I'm a lot better looking (I know this sounds bad). I just don't see how he makes me feel so bad about myself.

I'm not crazy right, I shouldn't be pressured so hard. At the start of the relationship he wasn't like this and he loved my body and have only got fitter. He also tells me his ex was smaller because she hardly ate and counted every calorie and skipped meals. ",1733821832.0,TomorrowSea7488,TwoXChromosomes
I finally stood up to my husband,"I’ve been with my husband for 17 years, married for 13.  Our dynamic is that he gets mad and demands something and I give in to keep the peace.  I always try to fix everything and take care of everything and it’s never enough.  Today he angrily demanded that I get rid of our cat because it pees on his drum mat. This cat was his idea to get and we’ve had her for 16 years.  About 12 years ago he wanted to get rid of her and I cried and he dropped it, but I had to take on all of her care.  I scooped her litter box during both pregnancies and such. If I tried to get him to help he would just say to get rid of her.  Anyhow, this morning he said I needed to get rid of her and I said NO.  He said fine he would get rid of her then and I calmly looked him in the eyes and said if he did I would never forgive him.  He seemed shocked.  I told him I put up with a lot of his shit and this was a bridge too far.  So he’s been sulking all day in the guest bedroom and I’ve been going about my normal routine.  I’m really proud of myself for putting my foot down.

Edit: the cat only peed on his mat when she was inadvertently separated from her litter box.  My oldest moved the cat and the litter box into her room for a period of time and then would accidentally shut the door and kitty would be trapped outside the room.  I’ve since moved the box to a more central location so this won’t happen again. The mat was the only somewhat soft spot she had access too since we have tile floors . She has not peed there for a while but he pulled the mat out today to clean it more thoroughly and the old urine stains are what set him off.

Edit 2: My husband is not always a jerk. He loves me, but he does take me for granted. I love him and I make it easy for him to take me for granted. I’ve just finally decided not to play that role anymore. Either he will accept it or he won’t. I’m not afraid of being alone or anything like that. I’d be fine.

Edit 3: Thank you to those offering encouragement and support.",1680399211.0,MammaMcCheese,TwoXChromosomes
Haven't had sex in nearly 16 months and don't even want to date my husband anymore,"I'm in a down mood tonight and just want to get something off my chest.


My DH and I have had issues with a dead bedroom for years. It started a few months before I gave birth to our firstborn, who's now 5. His libido went to zero and stayed there. I felt neglected and unhappy, so I tried to solve the problem. I tied myself in knots trying to turn him on, only to find myself rejected the vast, vast majority of the time. I tried backing off and letting him be the initiator, only to find that his libido is active only approximately twice a year. I communicated until I was blue in the face about how I was feeling, how he was feeling, how we were a team, how we could solve this, etc. Got empty rhetoric of ""I'll do better"" in return.


I want to note at this point that our sex life has never actually been ""good."" I have never orgasmed from a man, DH included. He's never really tried. I've never really minded, because (a) I was young and stupid when we got together, and (b) I find sex to be primarily for bonding. I can have an orgasm by myself anytime; I can't achieve that special closeness to another person all by myself. Quantity over quality is genuinely okay by me.


Which of course means that having no quantity OR quality was/is a terrible combination. After about 1.5 years of effort -- and it WAS a huge effort -- we finally reached a better place, courtesy mainly of scheduling sex. We decided to go for a second kid. That took a while, and honestly I blame the lengthy conception process for a large part of what's happening now. He started rejecting any attempts at sex that weren't in my fertile window. I had to track carefully and give him several days of advance notice of when sex ""should"" happen. Then he could only stay hard in one position (both of us lying down on our sides, with me facing away from him) and only for just long enough to get the job done. Foreplay was utterly nonexistent, and any attempts I made to change things up (looking at each other, me getting on top, etc.) were rejected. I cried sometimes after sex because of how dehumanizing it felt. I can only assume he hated it as much as I did.


That brings us to today. Baby is seven months old, and DH and I have not had sex since I got my positive pregnancy test -- about 16 months total. And the thing now is, I don't care. I have lost so much love and desire to bond with him that I just don't care if I never have sex with him again. I remember the desires that I still had after my firstborn, and they are just completely, 100% gone. He obviously doesn't care, and now, finally, thankfully, neither do it.


So here I am, in a sexless, romance-less coparenting relationship. We don't sleep in the same room or even hug and kiss or say ""I love you"" (except to end a phone call). And the thing is, I don't even want to be his friend, if that makes sense? The other week, we had a rare opportunity to go out for dinner together sans kids, and he asked me if I wanted to go. I said no. Not out of spite or anything; I just genuinely didn't want to. To me it would feel like that would just be pretending and playacting at being a romantic, loving couple -- or even just a couple of pals catching up at dinner -- and I just ... don't want to playact. It feels false. I didn't say that to him, although I would've been honest if he'd asked. He looked a bit hurt but just went out by himself instead, while I enjoyed a quiet evening home by myself.


Just getting it off my chest, I guess, because my birthday is coming up and I'm dreading him asking me if I want to go out for dinner with him. I'm hoping he just doesn't ask and we have a family dinner instead. Basically the only way I don't mind him in my space is if the kids are there too. I can cope with coparenting. Past experience has taught me exactly how much effort it takes to upgrade from coparenting, and honestly ... it's just not worth it.

EDIT: Wow, this got way more attention than I ever thought. I figured I would just scream into the void a little bit before bed. Woke up and now there are so many notifications.

I have errands most of the day, but I promise I will read all the comments and respond to what I can. Thank you for taking the time. To address some of the questions I've seen from briefly skimming the comments:

Q: First and foremost, why did you bring another kid into this mess? A: I think this question is missing the point. It wasn't a mess when we decided to have a second kid, at least in my (perhaps deluded) view. We had reached a place in our marriage that I was happy with. This wasn't a situation of ""surely a baby will fix our broken marriage!"" This was ""our marriage has been through a rough patch but come out the other side and now we are ready to amplify our happiness."" Maybe it was stupid, but I genuinely thought we'd overcome the challenges. I even shared my happiness in the deadbedrooms sub like the fool I was.

Q: Has he been medically tested? A: Yes, after MONTHS of asking, and only if you count going to the laziest doctor in the world. It's no secret I dislike his doctor. What kind of so-called physician, hearing a healthy-looking young man come in and say ""I have no sex drive, can I have a testosterone test?"", just responds ""Sure, here's a hormone panel, bye now"" with no follow-up questions? Anyway, his testosterone is apparently normal and he doesn't want to go back to a doctor again.

Q: Is he gay/asexual/addicted to porn? A: I've asked. He's denied it and disliked the line of questioning. 

Q: Did you get fat/stinky/undesirable after kids? A: Nope. Lost the weight quickly both times and generally take care of myself and my health (my unsatisfied physical drive notwithstanding).

Q: Have you tried counselling? A: I've asked that too and he doesn't want to. I may have to force the issue or at least try individually counselling for myself.

Q: Have you considered an affair? A: Not a dishonest one ... but I'm not gonna lie, I would jump at the opportunity if he said I could get a lover.",1693200785.0,dbthrowawayrowaway,TwoXChromosomes
partner mad at me for removing my iud,"This is something that is blowing my mind rn. I've recently come to the realization that my hormonal iud has greatly affected my mental health. I had some mental health problems before my iud, but its made them CONSIDERABLY worse. After doing some research, I'm not the only one; other women out there have validated my experience. I want to be birth control free for the first time since I was 18, to let my hormones level out and actually receive my period and let myself be healthy. 
However I am in a long term relationship and told my partner what my plan was. He was absolutely shocked. He said he didn't want me to cause he enjoys having unprotected sex. I told him I know it isn't the most convenient things but I think my health is more important than our ability to have unprotected sex. He still wasn't impressed. 
What is really making me irrate Is that men/society assume it's the woman's sole responsibility to worry about unplanned pregnancy, at the expense of our health.Birth control is notorious for mental health problems, cancer, stroke, weight gain, blood clots ect. And yes I know birth control was a major step in women's rights and our right to choose, but It takes two people to make a baby, and condoms work. I know plenty of couples who's main source of birth control is condoms. 
What makes me even more mad is that I went through a medical procedure, with NO PAIN MANAGEMENT, or local anesthetic and had a foreign object put into my body. That was so painful i fainted after the procedure, and lets jot mention the agonizing cramps i had for weeks aftwr. And when I told my partner that HE has the choice to go get a vasectomy if unprotected sex is really that important to him, and he said he doesn't want to because he ""shouldn't have to go through a medical procedure"" and it will be ""painful"". Even though he's of age to be able to get accepted to get one, and they can be reversed.
I love my partner but this whole situation is really making me realize how unfair this is. And how men don't realize women are sacrificing our health for the sake of unprotected sex. (Yes I know not all men think this way, but its enough).

Update: i did not think this post was gunna blow up like it did, so i just wanna say a few things. I have an appointment set and I don't plan on being on birth control again anytime soon, no matter what anyone says. Yes I agree this situation is shitty and my partner could have behaved a hell of a lot better and i reacted accordingly. BUT I made this post to prove that even the men we love and know have internalized misogyny against women and our bodies. Also to the people Simply saying to break up with my partner and leave him over a disagreement that we have and will continue to talk about and work on, clearly have never been in a long term committed relationship and had a major fight. Don't jump to conclusions and assume you know the dynamic between me and my partner over a paragraph post on reddit. Thank you lol.",1647045726.0,Physical-Lettuce-333,TwoXChromosomes
Why is it hard for men to believe that women are happier unmarried and single without children?,"Hello everyone. I just want to have a conversation with all the women on here about men who don’t believe that women are happier single and childless. I have seen and heard men on podcasts and on social media say that women are not happier being single, unmarried and childless and they actually believe that women are miserable being single, unmarried and childless. I have also heard men say that single women are lonely. This is not true at all, because there are some people who are in marriages and in relationships who are not happy in them and they are also miserable. You can also be in a relationship and marriage and still be lonely in them. I have also heard men say that a woman’s job on this planet is to be with men and to procreate.

In my personal opinion, I feel that the answer to women are happier single unmarried without children is yes and no. As a woman myself, I feel like it is safe and I can speak for some of us women and say that some of us will love to be in a healthy and loving relationship and be married with children, but if that is not available to us, then we will be okay and happy to be single. It is better than being with a man who is going to treat you like crap.  

I am not married and I don’t have children, but I have had married women and older women who are retired tell me and advise me to not get married. This right here says a lot. 

I also want to say that the happiest man is a married man and the happiest woman is a single unmarried woman without children. 

So why do you think it is hard for men and that they don’t believe that single unmarried women without children are happy?",1686247368.0,AcanthisittaOwn6051,TwoXChromosomes
"For those in healthy relationships, what are the best things/green flags about your partner?","The idea for this post came to me mostly because it's very easy to get stuck in a bad relationship because ""it could be worse, look at the way my friend's boyfriend treats her"" or similar trains of thought. I've seen women in my life put up with sub-par partners because ""I'd never find someone better"". 

I won't lie, it took a lot of work and communication (and patience on my part) for my relationship to get to where it is now. My boyfriend is a truly wonderful person who was and is always willing to improve and do better as a person and as a partner, which is the main reason for us being where we are today (for a bit of context: he was raised in a family with...weird...dynamics, to say the least. Adjacent to that, his mom has a strange relationship with her sons and was indirectly interfering in our relationship.) None of the positive change we had would have been possible if he didn't want to change and didn't take action to change.

Now I think our relationship is in a truly healthy, happy and loving place. So I'll begin answering the question in the title of this post with the things he does that make me feel this way:

- The housework is split equally based on who hates a chore the least (for instance: I kinda hate washing dishes and he doesn't really like doing laundry, so he washes the dishes and I do the laundry. I love cooking and he doesn't, and he relaxes sweeping/mopping the floor and I don't, so I cook and he takes care of the floor; etc). If I'm feeling tired/burnt out/indisposed, he'll notice it and tackle both his and my chores without me even having to ask. He'll even offer to give me a massage (without it having to lead to sex).

- He has a list of the medicines I usually take when I have a cold, a migraine, food poisoning, etc, and whenever I have one of these things, he'll immediately get the right medicine for me if I don't have it with me. If we don't have it at home, he'll run to the pharmacy and get it. On top of taking care of the chores and cooking healthy comfort food. The last time I had a cold, he made me the most delicious veggie soup and put on one of my favorite movies for us to watch together.

- He'll advocate for me in a heartbeat. Recently one of his family members said something insensitive to me when he wasn't in the room and, when I mentioned it to him later at home, he was livid. The next day, he met with the person and told them he would not tolerate that behavior and there would be no second time. All I did was mention in a jokey tone ""your family member said this, haha"", but he saw how hurt I was and did this unprompted. 

- He admires my hobbies and interests as much as I do his, and will listen to me ramble, all while asking questions and finding ways to show he's interested. He's a very stereotipically masculine man and doesn't diminish me for loving stereotipically girly things like fashion, and actually spontaneously volunteers to watching fashion shows with me every once in a while.

- Gift-giving is not his strong suit. He's a very practical person and has a hard time coming up with gift ideas, so he prefers to choose gifts that are generally liked, while I tend to focus more on the individual and like to choose gifts that would be perfect for that person specifically. Knowing this, he always makes an effort to choose these types of gifts for me. When he was looking for my Christmas gift, he also saw that there was an official Stardew Valley cookbook available for preorder, and immediately pre-ordered it for me.

He does so many nice things for me, but this post is already very long and, if I kept going, I wouldn't know when to stop. I love him so much and, like him, I always make a point of showing him how much I love and appreciate the person and partner he is, and I hope he feels as happy as I do. Everyone deserves a partner that loves and respects them, takes initiative and makes an effort, and I'm tired of seeing women put up with less. This is my attempt to help raise the bar a little bit.",1707427976.0,isbobdylansingle,TwoXChromosomes
Boyfriend broke up with me after 7 years together…,"Because I’m not “house-wifey” enough for him. I work a full-time job with an hour long commute and wake up at 4:30 every morning, and he works at home. He is upset that I don’t come home after work and cook a meal for him that’s big enough to also have leftovers that he can then eat the next day for lunch. Mind you, he always just eats frozen meals for lunch because he can’t be bothered to cook for himself. 

He had the audacity to tell me that I should just put a pot roast in a crock pot before I leave for work at 5am, then he can be home to make sure it doesn’t burn (literally meaning make sure the house doesn’t catch fire, not actually checking the food temperature). Like WHAT!? Put the damn thing in yourself if you think it’s not that big a deal!! 

He grew up in a different country with a different culture, where his mom and dad both worked full time, but his mom still cooked for the entire family of 7, so he doesn’t understand how I can’t just do it for the 2 of us. I had to be the one to remind him that he also had TWO LIVE-IN housekeepers/maids AND his mom worked from home. 

While I don’t disagree that someone should definitely be cooking and it’s not healthy or financially wise to order out every night, why is it my sole responsibility? Oh, right, because I’m a woman…

Anyway, I’m now sitting on my brand new bed that I built myself, in my new gorgeous townhome, not having shed a tear this entire time, wondering why I just didn’t do this sooner myself! 

I refuse to apologize for being a career-oriented woman, and not living up to societies roles for me. Now I’m going to cook for myself because I WANT TO, not because I need to fulfill my “womanly duties” for a man that doesn’t respect my value or needs.

***Update*** thank you everyone for all your kind words and rewards! The first time I have cried during this whole ordeal was last night, but they were happy tears and laughter from reading all your comments! All your words just reiterated to me that this transition is going to be so good for me! I have added some new red flags to my partner search, but right now it’s time to focus on ME. I will cook that damn pot roast for myself and enjoy every mouthful!! 

Also, my new townhouse is only 8 minutes away from my work. So there’s another added bonus!",1647831144.0,KeiraRose,TwoXChromosomes
Going from an extremely unhealthy relationship to a healthy one is an absolute mindfuck,"It's just weird how fundamentally it changes your life. It feels like I escaped from a prison or something. Being able to go about my day to day life normally, going from fighting almost every single day with my ex to rarely fighting with my partner. And when we do ""fight"" it's not like spitting venom and screaming, it's just laughing at how stupid we're being and discussing things calmly like adults. Also just going through the same scenarios in a completely different way. I went to a bachelorette weekend when I was with my ex and got told ""have fun being a whore, go fuck other guys"". Went to another one while I'm with my current boyfriend, completely normal experience, got told ""have fun and be safe! I'll miss you and can't wait to see you when you get back!"". Crazy stuff man.

My BF defended grooming relationships. I ended it.,"My bf and I had been together 3.5 years. He has some questionable views on feminism and progressive politics. He's very much the ""you have to hear both sides of the story"" type of person. I've tried to explain to him before how that view is largely used to silence women. He will just insist that's not what he's doing. Any time a story of sexual assault is in the news, he brings up stories and unsubstantiated rumors he has heard about women making false allegations. As a victim of multiple sexual assaults, I've always thought maybe I'm just over sensitive on the subject and he's made me feel that was the case.

He also firmly believes women and people of color are regularly given promotions and job opportunities simple because of their gender/race even though they aren't qualified, taking opportunities away from more qualified white men.

Today, I shared a relationship advice post with him about a 25 year old woman married for 6 years to a now 40 year old man, so married when she was 19 and he was 36. He knows I see men 30+ dating barely legal teenagers as a huge red flag and likely a grooming situation. His immediate reaction was to defend men dating teenagers, going so far as to send me bogus research articles, and told me I'm stereotyping by assuming the relationship wasn't healthy. I don't know what it was about this particular situation, maybe because the woman who made the post in question was legitimately being raped and abused, but I finally lost it. 

To be clear, we had other issues that had me questioning the future of the relationship, he recently started policing my food, he often lashes out at me when angry about other things, and when I bring up problematic things he has said he tells me I'm making it up and he never said that, but for some reason this was the last straw for me. I just don't want to be with someone who won't believe a woman until they hear what a man has to say.

I caught my worthless husband cheating and I feel great,"He’s been sexting with a coworker and they planned to meet up. He’s signed up with at least 4 dating sites. I woke up this morning with eyes so puffy they were almost swollen shut. Then I realized that I don’t have to put up with his constantly shitty mood anymore. I don’t have to do all the emotional labor. I don’t have to do jack shit for him. I feel absolutely nothing for him and all of his sobbing and snot and apologies. There is just this huge void where are my love and caring for him used to be.
I feel SO free.

I’m not sure if this is just relief or dissociation, though. So I’m gonna join a gym, eat healthy, buy some new panties and upgrade my ancient hitachi magic wand. Any advice or recommendations are appreciated!




Edit: I really can’t express how much your words mean to me. I am so sorry so many of you have gone/are going through this pain. Thank you all so much!

To touch on a few common questions, he’s slept on a recliner for two days. As much as I’d like to throw him out and serve him with divorce papers today, I really have to be cautious for now so that he’ll continue to be cooperative. I am 100% sure we’ll be divorced, though. I’m looking into therapy for myself and my two kids and contact a lawyer ASAP. I have no intention of dating anyone until all of this is over and I’ve had a shit ton of therapy.

For the handful of people who cared about his reasoning (and I sure as fuck don’t) he said he felt old and fat. He hates himself and any attention he got from these women was an ego boost. Every time we talk now he cries.  He sobs and I feel just completely emptiness in the part of me that used to care. I suspect maybe it has something to do with his diabetes, super low testosterone, and ED. But again, not my problem.

I bought the cute undies and Satisfyer 2 Pro plus. I’m looking into the other vibes mentioned. I’m sure I’m gonna have the best sex of my life with myself soon!

Edit 2: The comment about the testosterone really upset a couple guys. I never shamed him about his health problems, if anything I was too accommodating. So I’ll give you an example of how exhausting the relationship was. He never gave himself the shots. Whatever, some people don’t like needles. I’d give him the shot then he’d be cranky with me for the rest of the night because his leg hurt. He’d say I did it wrong this time. I was the one setting a reminder on my phone for every two weeks. We’d run out of syringes, he wouldn’t buy more. I’d mention it, he’d ignore me. His medicine would expire, I’d mention it, and he wouldn’t go to the doctor for a refill. On and on, over and over. He wouldn’t let me give him the shot unless he felt absolutely terrible. Now imagine the situation I mentioned repeating in every other facet of our lives. He wasn’t always like this. But this is who he is now.

Edit 3: I’m going to make an appointment for an STD check. Ugh.
The only reason I found out is because he gave me his phone to charge. It was sitting right next to my tablet in my field of vision when a message popped up. It said something about “getting chills thinking about our meeting.” I thought it was spam. But then a minute later, “are you still there?” So I asked him and he said he didn’t know. He looked at it for a minute and handed the phone back to me to charge it. I saw that he had deleted the messages. Then I just knew. So I logged into our cellphone account and saw 189 messages between them from that night. He finally admitted it. I guess he had just talked to her that night but he’s apparently been trying to cheat with women online for 4-5 weeks.",1622537093.0,Lushmelts,TwoXChromosomes
"Stop asking for and answering the ""body count"" question, ladies.","Seriously.

Good lord. I just read about some dumb ass who dumped his girlfriend because she had a higher body count. He had 3, she had 24.

Listen.

You can fuck 100 people once, or you can fuck one person 100 times. Fact is, ***YOU*** FUCKED 100 TIMES!

I've been with my husband for 18 years, still going strong. The best sex I have EVER had has always been with him. I don't know how many women he's had sex with before me, and he doesn't know how many men I've had sex with before him. Hell, even *I* don't remember. 😂 I know he dated a stripper ... but yeah, so what? WE are together living a great life.

I'm in my mid 50s and when I look back to see what my 20s were all about, or when I get reminded about them when I read about what 20 something year olds are doing or not doing, I think, ""OMG, Was I that *TEDIOUS*???""

Yes. Yes I very likely was. LOL 🙃

It's really sad to read that in 2022 young women are not only *still* facing what I faced as a young woman, *it's actually getting* ***worse***. I think the only disillusion of life that I have right now is that I had always envisioned women getting more equality, respect, and consideration. I grew up watching bra burnings and the whole equal rights movement. (F.U. Phyllis  Schlafly) I thought for sure that by NOW we'd be respected.

My whole 20 year career in a male dominated field (software development, and I *have* an *actual* degree, too) proved me wrong.

I remember long LONG ago, I think it may have been in the 1990s, I read an article about the more women gain freedoms and equalities, pressure on us to ""conform"" to men's wants becomes even more intense. The example used, and I remember this part clearly because I was a child when the commercial was in rotation: women may be going out into the workforce and demanding equality, but she's got to come home and do it all.  [This Enjoli commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_kzJ-f5C9U).

On first look it appears to be an empowering commercial about how women are going to work, but if you dissect it closely she is *still also doing the housework*. it's a message about, ""Sure, babe, go out and earn your 'fun money' but you *still* have obligations at home.""

I wish I could find that article, it was so long ago when I read it.

Now, look at what's up. I'm really proud of the women who are no longer putting up with bullshit from men. The fact that there are men who find themselves lonely amuses me. They'd rather be alone (even though they *claim* to want to be in a relationship) than become an actual adult and treat women with respect, equality, and consideration. The mere fact that they don't grow up tells me they'd rather be alone. The [""man-child""](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+man+child+psychology&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS930US930&oq=the+man-child&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i22i30l8j0i15i22i30.2996j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is an actual thing. eeesh.

To point back to that article, with women being more independent and no ""need"" for someone else to provide for us, men, especially young men, are turning backwards even harder - Tate, Peterson, etc. The sad fact is, they're the ones losing out. Not us.

What's your body count? 1. I only have 1 body. (Just don't look at the various mounds of dirt in my backyard. 😏)

Edit: wow! Lots of great conversation and points here. I've learned a few things, got new perspectives, and disagree with a few comments. I appreciate this staying civil. Thank you.

Edit 2: I am not saying anyone doesn't have a right to break up with someone for whatever reason they have. OF COURSE! 

IMO, ""body count"" is a ridiculous way to determine morals, values, ethics, etc. All that is doing is ""keeping score"" which is NOT healthy in a relationship. If you want to understand someone's values, ideals, ethics, morals, etc, surrounding sex, and not just sex but other things that are important to you, *speak to them like an adult and have an adult conversation*. Ask questions. *Use your words*. The number of bodies someone has fucked is irrelevant. They may have changed for better OR worse. The actual number of bodies someone has fucked is irrelevant.",1670684354.0,hdmx539,TwoXChromosomes
"My fiancé chose me, and I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this before.","So yesterday, I (34f), came down with a rather nasty chest infection/sinusitis. (negative RATs but waiting PCR results). Anyways. This threw a spanner in the works for a bunch of plans I’d been looking forward to for weeks, one of which was going to see his family and spend the weekend there. I love his family very much and already feel like I’m a part of theirs even though we’re not married yet (together nearly 4 years). 

I knew he was upset because we haven’t visited in a while and I thought he’d be upset with me, so I told him he should go by himself.  I overheard him on the phone to his mum saying he was sorry we couldn’t make it but I was rather sick and he needed to look after me. 

I bought it up later with him and said I was sorry he missed seeing his family (especially a dinner with his cousin and partner who have been overseas for ages) and he kind of surprisingly said “what? No.. I need to look after you. You look after me when I’m sick.. this is what we do now”. I was very taken aback. I’ve been in quite a few long term relationships (previously engaged in fact)  and have NEVER had a partner prioritise me like this. 

This may be a normal thing, I don’t even know. I am dealing with my past trauma a lot and have come so far with the love of this man. I just can’t believe how lucky I am to have him.

I walked out of a baby shower because a priest decided to give a sermon denying DV and shaming people who leave,"For the record I am a survivor of incest and domestic violence. I was at a baby shower in early 2022 and there was a priest giving a sermon about parenting. It started off blessing her pregnancy and marriage and praying for a healthy baby, and saying that parents and children have a special bond, which I felt was ok and appropriate for a baby shower. Then it turned nasty.

“Parents are the people in your life who will never hurt you. Everything a parent does, they do it with the purest intentions. They may make mistakes but no parent ever hurts their child on purpose. Even if you think they do, you need to understand that being a parent gives you a special relationship to the world and your parents do everything out of love for you. You should always obey your parents no matter what.”

And of course, the expecting mother was sitting there with a smug look on her face.

I just got up and walked out without a word. I sort of wish I had taken back my gift from the table and donated it to a DV shelter and sent her the receipt afterwards.",1713548108.0,Immediate_Revenue_90,TwoXChromosomes
what my church told my daughter about abortion last night,"She was at a lock in (modified due to Covid ) from 5pm to 11pm last night, and I just took her back this morning for the rest of the ""lock in"". The topics last night were birth control, pregnancy, and yes, abortion.

What did they say about abortion? They told her it was one of several options, and that the only one that gets to decide what option to go with is the person who is pregnant. They informed them about medical and surgical abortion options.

She also learned about all different forms of birth control, which ones do and don't prevent STIs, etc.

She has been attending these classes for middle school youth for months now. She has also been taught about consent, and that lack of consent isn't just someone saying no, that  coercion to get to yes is not okay. They have learned about healthy boundaries in friendships and romantic/secual relationships, and healthy communication skills. About sexual identity - and all healthy relationships are a blessing. Mind you, her class is led by a gay man with a PhD in Human Sexuality. The kids can ask questions anonymously but putting them in a box to be read by the teachers and discussed.

These kids, including my daughter, will have all the information they need to make healthy, responsible choices for their relationships.

This is nationwide program, called Our Whole Lives, and is led by Unitarian and United Church of Christ congregations. (It is NOT relgious, although there is a religious supplement that some UCC churches use with it. Ours does not, as we have people that attend the class that are not from our church, and because there is just too much information to cover in the class without that supplement. They trust parents to discuss the spiritual aspects with them at home, and the parents are given a list of topics before each class so they can be prepared. That said, what a child brings up in class is NEVER shared with parents unless it it is a safety issue.

I know I'm older than a lot of people here, but if there are people on here with older kids, I highly suggest looking into this program. They have different ones for different age groups, in fact they even have one for senior citizens!! At the initial parent meeting us adults shared so many questions ourselves about changing terminology, etc that the pastor said he's going to look into offering the adult level class next year, since we didn't grow up with this program as kids, and many of us have stuff we could learn about these things.

So, yeah. Thee are so many churches doing awful things to shame people for their sexuality, or try to legislate it, or groom kids to be in crappy abusive relationships that it is heartening to see that other organized religious groups are ""fighting back"" and actually DOING SOMETHING to prepare kids to be their true selves, and have healthy sexual and romantic relationships.

(edit - link is to a UU program, but the church I attend, and that my daughter takes the classes at, is a United Church of Christ congregation.)

Thinking of the third graders I knew on diets. The women starving themselves for their weddings. The sleepovers where classmates compared their bodies. The times my friends chose salads or steamed vegetables over food they wanted. It’s so tragic.

"Goofy, irresponsible men and their perfect women in sitcoms","This seems to be a very common theme in sitcoms and I can't just think how impractical these relationships would be in real like. 

I'm currently watching psych ( still in s5 so no spoilers please) and Shawn reminds me so much of Jake from B99 who is also very irresponsible and goofy while both Amy and Juliet are responsible adults who have their life together. 

Even though we actually see their lives after getting married I can't imagine how unhappy a relationship like that would be irl even though I absolutely adore Jake and Amy.

The only sitcom couple that I think have a very healthy, equitable relationship is Leslie and Ben from parks and recreation. 

I also recently watched Kevin and F himself and I'm now definitely a lot more critical about sitcom couples that I was before.

"At 18, I married my rapist. I’m now 33 and finally had the courage to tell my family.","Two weeks before my 18th birthday, I met a man I’ll call James. James was introduced to me through a mutual friend and we hit it off instantly. 

I would describe myself as a pretty awkward, shy, and insecure kid/teenager and the fact that James, who I found incredibly attractive, was interested in me blew my mind. 

One night James asked me if I wanted to hang out at his place (he lived on his own) so I lied to my parents and said I was staying over at a friends house. When I arrived, he offered me whisky and wanted to play a drinking game (I had never had alcohol before). The next thing I knew I was naked on the floor of the living room trying to push him off of me while yelling “no” repeatedly. This was how I lost my virginity. 

The next morning, he offered to take me to Planned Parenthood to get plan b. There was no acknowledgement of what happened the night before. 

The next day, James joked with me that he wanted to marry me. My traumatized brain couldn’t make heads or tails of the immense guilt I felt about lying to my parents and feeling responsible for the rape itself. 

Four days after my 18th birthday, we married. I told my parents three months later and they kicked me out of the house. James was a manipulative narcissist, a compulsive liar, and emotionally abusive. I left him almost a year later. 

My parents have always been mad and disappointed in what they have perceived as a terrible and reckless decision I made when I was a teenager. I’ve had a lot of time to think and process this year and finally decided this week to tell them exactly what happened that led me down the marriage path with James. It was one of the most healing moments of my life to be able to share what I went through. My parents were shocked and sad and most of all, loving and understanding. I feel lighter already. 

TL:DR I had a short marriage at 18 years old to a man that raped me and finally decided to tell my family, who were loving and understanding of what I went through.

EDIT: Holy shit! I just got out of my morning meetings and this has blown up. First of all, thank you all so incredibly much for the love and support. Your kindness is reverberating in me today and I can’t stop wiping the tears from my eyes. The ugliness of the situation itself somehow feels overpowered by the warmth you’re sharing today. Thank you. 

Some people asked about what happened afterwards. It took me four years to get the courage to go to therapy and tell my story. This was the first time I was told that I had been raped (prior to this I didn’t know that’s what it was). I had also developed an eating disorder and alcohol problem and was using sex as a way of finding control. After a LOT more therapy I found my way to living a happy, healthy, and productive life. I’m single now, but have been able to experience truly loving romantic relationships. Today I am extremely happy, have a fantastic relationship with my friends and family, and continue to find ways to heal and move myself forward. 

To all of you who have experienced what I have: I’m so sorry. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I feel for you, I love you, I’m here for you. You are important and there is a light at the end the tunnel ❤️

EDIT #2: Thank you all for the comments and DMs. As expected most are incredibly heartwarming and my inbox is open for anyone who wants to talk. 

To those of you who call me dumb/stupid or doesn’t believe me: May your reaction be more loving to those in your world should they experience the same. 

To those who don’t get why I married my assailant: understanding the brain under trauma is complex and I hope you seek first to understand before jumping to conclusions. 

Much love to all 🥰",1608740775.0,bananaresemblance,TwoXChromosomes
"I just need to be sad right now. My kid is permanently, unequivocally, forever battling a medical condition. And it sucks.","And I don't know where else to share this. It's 11pm on Halloween night. My friends, family, and husband are all fast asleep. I'm laying beside my 7 year old daughter, cradling her as she survives through the chaos that is Type 1 Diabetes. She's snoring, but in between bouts of snores, she whimpers. About an hour ago, she cried out ""Why is this me?!"" then was right back to sleep.



I cry. For the first time since her diagnosis, I really really cry. You know the kind. Snot dripping down your face, big awkward gulps of air. Wailing.



Thank goodness she's a heavy sleeper.



She was just diagnosed in August. It's been 3 months. Only 3 months? And today, she ate a few extras candies (literally like 3 candies at school). Her blood sugar levels were high. Then we went trick or treating, and they got low. So we treated them with 15g of simple sugars - candy. We sat on the walking trail by our house while she laid down in her Joan of Arc costume. We waited. She came back up. My husband was ancy because our son was getting tired.  So we pushed through. We got to our friend's and she could barely stand. I gave her a piggy back ride and she said, ""You're the best mom ever. Like really, ever."" 



She struggled the whole way home. I tried to give her a piggy back ride again, but I was tired. She ninja rolled under our neighbour's fence to take the shortcut home. I met her there. 



And all night, she's had a horrific headache. Her stomach hurts. And she's weepy. Everything is the worst. My amazing, strong, fucking brilliant little mini-me is now wailing in pain because her stupid fucking pancreas has decided to stop making insulin. Fuck you, pancreas. 



She asks me to read to her. I do. Normally, it's one book, then 10 minutes of cuddles. Today, it's as many books as she wants. She asks me to keep reading as she falls asleep. I read Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, while admiring my own little rebel girl.



One who will now die if she doesn't have insulin. 



Everything changes so quickly. For the first time since her diagnosis, I long for the days when our biggest hurdle was her having temper tantrums and wetting the bed. 



Now she has a team of people who need to be her pancreas. 



She snores. She wails. She cries. Then, for the first time since her diagnosis, she throws up. 



Now, if you know anything about people with t1d, it's that they need carbs, along with insulin, to keep their numbers stable.



She just threw up all of her carbs. The carbs that keep her from having seizures, or falling into a coma.



Her numbers go lower.



I go to the kitchen to grab water, and by the time I'm back, she's fallen back asleep.



With as much love as forcefully possible, I manage to get her to eat a single bite of a banana. I have to wake her up to do so.



She throws up 20 minutes later. 
I give her a spoonful of honey. She manages to take it. For now. 



I call the ""pediatric endocrinologist"", because my child now has a fucking specialist doctor? And he says to keep the needles and syringes handy in case her numbers go low again. I start bawling as I try to give him my email address so he can send me explicit instructions on now to stick a needle into my kid. And now, I'm awake, checking her every hour. 



I have work in the morning. 



This is my life now. 



This is her life now.



I try to practice gratitude, but in this moment, it just sucks ass. She's one of the healthiest kids I've ever met. She eats cherry tomatoes as a snack. She loves avocados. She tries new things. She self reflects. She sleeps well. She is adaptable. She drinks water. We don't even keep juice in the house (at least, not until sugar became her medication, because what the fuck right?) She stands up for her friends at school. She does math for fun. She sings and imagines. She's honest. We're as close as a mom and daughter can be (in a healthy way).



So, I'm pretty sure that we're living in the twilight zone. Everything feels upside down.



I'm thankful that she has such a strong support network. But at this moment, I feel cripplingly alone. I feel like I need to remember this night, our first really hard night. Maybe it'll knock me out of my positivity and gratitude that seems to weird people out. Maybe it'll make me more cynical or resentful. 



But then I look at her, and my heart bursts with love. At least we're in this together, her and me. Because if anyone could fucking own this shit, it's her.



I'm pretty sure that she's my hero. 


I don't even really know what the point of sharing this is. To feel a little less alone, maybe.


I gotta go now. I gotta check to see if her blood sugars are stable. 



Thanks for listening.


Edit: Holy shit. I posted this around midnight my time, and was thankful if I had gotten a few words of encouragement and support. I did NOT expect to wake up this morning to so much solidarity. Thank you all, so so much. My daughter is an incredible person, and we keep our adaptability and enthusiasm as high as possible on most days. This is the darkest day I've ever had with it so far, I think because I had to have the specialized ""In Case of Emergency"" Glucagon needle ready. My usual response to people is, ""I'm just thankful that we live in the time and place that we're in"", and that if anyone is strong enough for this, it's my daughter. She's been relatively on target for the first 2.5 months, but the past couple of weeks have been wildly random, and it's been hard to understand why. We have it comparatively easy because she's incredibly healthy otherwise. She still has Halloween candy from last year! As a mother, I consciously focused on removing the shame and emotional attachment that my family history has to food (and body image, and self-care), and for the most part, my daughter has a great outlook on herself, her relationship with her body, and with how she takes care of it. It's made dealing with the diagnosis so much more manageable. She has an incredible support network, a great school, I have a great job, and we are all rallying around her. We are really fortunate. Thank you for letting me share my darkness with you all so that it didn't come out of me in her presence.

We try to see her t1d as ""you're not sick, it's just an extra thing you need to do to take care of yourself, like how we take showers and eat nutritious food and get good sleep. You can still do all the things, we just need to do these extra steps."" But last night was a ""yep, my kid is definitely sick beyond normal sick"" kind of night, and it slapped me in the face.


Many of you have asked about CGMs and Pumps - our work benefits are finicky, and our doctors advised not to consider these tools for at least six months ""so we know how to handle things without them"". FWIW, we're in Canada. It's been three months, and I feel like a CGM would allow us to actually establish consistent patterns and make informed choices, so we decided to go ahead and apply for the insurance coverage. We're now just in the limbo of waiting for approval and then getting set up (with a Dexcom G6). It takes time, but we're pushing towards it. As for pumps, we hadn't even really considered one because she had been on target so frequently. But if I can prevent another night like this (while still giving her the space to just BE A KID), then I'm all for it. I will be looking into it today.

Again, thank you all for everything. The private messages, the awards (what do I do with these? Thank you for making my daughter's story more visible!), the comments, the practical advice; even the insensitive comments are appreciated - it comes with the territory of putting yourself out there, and it's worth it. Thank you all for sharing your stories of living with t1d, or being a support of someone with t1d. It means so much to me. Our family stands on the shoulders of giants who have found solutions to the problems so that we can adapt easier. I will do my best to get back to everyone that I can, but even if I don't, know that I read every single message and have been crying like a baby. But this time there's a little less weight on my shoulders when I do it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",1572582655.0,alarmingly_alarmed,TwoXChromosomes
My boyfriend just broke up with me out of the blue after he just moved in and I am devastated.,"I (27F) was very suddenly broken up with by my now (26M) ex boyfriend on Sunday. He was out late drinking with friends Saturday night and basically came to the decision he’s been unhappy for months but hasn’t communicated anything to me. So on Sunday after he finishes work he tells me that and says he wants to break up and that there’s no salvaging the relationship. For context - he works in restaurants and I work have a fairly successful career in sales for someone my age. So his justification for leaving me was that our schedules are too different, my job will relocate me and he doesn’t want to leave the city we’re currently in and things just aren’t working anymore. So naturally I am devastated and tell him to leave after he made it very clear there was nothing he was willing to do to talk it out. 

Flash forward to Monday, he texts me he wants to come over and talk. I agree and he comes over to tell me he doesn’t want to break up but also he slept with one of his coworkers the night he ended things. He said he knows I have no reason to take him back but he still wanted to tell me and then completely changed his tune on moving with me and said he was afraid to communicate being unhappy because he didn’t want to hurt me. 

I’ve told him to get all his stuff out of my apartment this weekend while I am out of town and I guess he’s found a new place to stay. So now I am left completely in shambles because this person I loved and trusted has completely shattered my life and what I thought my future would be with him. I don’t know what to do but any support or advice is appreciated. My friends have been helping me tremendously but I’m still just confused and hurt because this all happened so fast and never in a million years could I have predicted it. Our relationship before this wasn’t perfect but it was still overall healthy and I was happy. I have been nothing but supportive of him so I can’t wrap my head around what is happening and who this person I loved and trusted is and how they could throw me and our relationship away like trash.

Edit: also important detail, we’ve been together for a year and a half and had made long term plans together about the moving and living together. About a month ago we also adopted a cat together so I had no reason to believe he was feeling anything different from me.",1692288554.0,atom_cat_wilde,TwoXChromosomes
My ex un-alived himself.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I 23F was in a 4 year relationship with my ex 24M. 

We met in college and dated for 4 years. We clicked immediately. The first 3 years of our relationship were incredible. We were close friends for 8 months before dating. Even after we started dating, I always felt he would be in my life for a long time, even if we eventually broke up. 


Unfortunately, a little over a year ago he was in an accident and got a TBI. The last 10 months of our relationship was a nightmare. Once the initial phase of recovery was over, you couldn’t tell on the surface that anything was different. However, his entire personality changed. He went from being an extremely loving, driven, loyal , gentle and caring person to someone I could hardly recognize. 


He became verbally abusive, physically abusive, repeatedly cheated on me, had irrational thoughts, mental breakdowns, started drinking heavily which made all of his issues worse. 


He punched through the wall in our apartment, punched through the window. Eventually he got angry at me over an argument about where to order takeout and he swung at my face. I ended up curled up in a ball on the floor while he screamed at me for an hour until he went into the bedroom and slammed the door. That was the last straw for me. I moved out the next day and went no contact. 


I loved him, but I couldn’t take it anymore. The stress of being with him was taking a serious toll on me. I tried to make it work for 10 months. I helped take care of him in his early recovery, I stayed by him as long as i could. 
After I left him, he repeatedly tried to get in touch with me. Made fake instagram accounts. Called me at least 50 times from a blocked number. I would open the instagram DM’s but never responded, and blocked each new account he made. 


From one of his burner instagram accounts he messaged me saying how sorry he was and he couldn’t take the guilt anymore. He said if I didn’t call him he was going to unalive himself. My therapist said this was a common manipulation tactic and to ignore it. Well 48 hours later, he did it. And now I can’t function. It’s been 5 weeks now and all I can do is lay in bed and cry. 


I feel guilty because he was sick. Despite the fact that he became abusive, he loved me, and I know it’s not his fault. I was already grieving the loss of who he used to be. The loss of my best friend. Now he’s gone forever. 


EDIT: 

Thank you all for the kind words. I can’t respond to everyone individually, but I wanted to put an update here. So instead of writing this in my journal, I’ll write it here. 

One of the things that resonated with me most (and made me start bawling) was a comment that was along the lines of  “I lost him to the TBI a year ago and the real him would have wanted me to leave the version of him now”. 
It’s gut wrenching and true. 

I always felt like romance and love were cheesy. The pain of this showed me what it really means to love. When the person you’re dating is your best friend , it’s the cloud nine of relationships. We had a soul connection. Ironically we used to joke about how healthy our relationship was. No toxicity, jealousy, alot of laughter and support. When you have that level of connection, the relationship never feels difficult or threatened. 


We worked hard on his healing despite all of the bumps in the road. I know he tried to get better, but it wasn’t enough. When he sustained his injuries, we didn’t know if he was going to come through the other side. When he woke up, the first thing he asked was “where’s [insert my name]”. The fact that he was able to speak, still had all of his motor functions, and was eventually discharged from the hospital to outpatient PT smiling was such a relief.

I will never forget walking out with him over a month later to finally bring him home. The sun was setting, it was golden hour, and despite him always having an aversion to fast food, the only thing he wanted to eat was Mcdonalds. The first song he played in the car was Wild Horses by the rolling stones. We drove to McDonalds and laughed about random shit. Some guy in there looked like Donald Trump and my boyfriend started doing a Trump impression at the table. There was so much hope for my silly, sweet boy. 

I do carry survivors guilt. I’ve played so many things out in my head. I ruminate on not calling him. Because a simple phone call could have made the difference. It wrecks me. Maybe had he gotten the temporary help he needed in that moment, he could have gotten back on track to healing. I ruminate on the fact that I never was able to tell him I loved him again. When I left, I left quietly. I packed my stuff and said nothing. I never thought it would be the end of him in my life. Maybe the end of our romantic relationship, but I was okay with that. He knew I loved him, but maybe not how much. I didn’t even realize how much until after he passed. 

It hurts deeply that he left this earth, likely aware of how he terrified me. I believe he not only felt guilt for the last incident, but guilt for the year he put me through. He left me a note which I still have not opened. I know his heart, and it’s too much for me to handle reading at this time. 

I was pondering about what hurt the most over those 10 months. Was it him drunkenly hooking up with 3 other girls, one of which was a three some? No. 
Was it the physical and verbal abuse? No. Was it any other of the chaos he constantly brought into our lives, the fucking raccoon he brought into the apartment (i thought it had rabies and he was acting psychotic… it did not have rabies) , the numerous interactions with law enforcement, the list really goes on… but no. 
It was watching the person I loved so profoundly become a shell of themselves and not being able to do anything. 


With this kind of injury…the person you knew before is still in there. You see glimpses of them often, but they’re never complete. There’s always something missing, and for a long time I was working to get that piece back. I didn’t go through the stages of grief when he had the injury. So now there are two layers. 

Something about TBI’s that I learned from his Dr is each one is a fingerprint. No two are alike, and only time reveals the damage. 

It feels strange to say now, but the first three years of our relationship set the standard for healthy relationships in my life. It’s alot to process the past 10 months. 
I fall asleep at night and pretend he’s still with me. I spray the cologne he wore on the pillow next to me so I can sleep. 
I sleep in his hoodies. 

I initially took a leave from work, but have since resigned. Grief is complex and takes time. It hits you in waves. I want to relocate after spending some time healing and processing this with friends and family. After his injury we became co-dependent which I didn’t fully understand until now. I didn’t feel like I was sacrificing anything to try to help him because I loved him and I know he would have done the same or more for me. I regret none of that time, because I know I tried. Now I work on visualizing him as an angel. He can finally rest. A part of him will always be with me. ",1713358172.0,Secret_Telephone8022,TwoXChromosomes
One evening me (F31) and my fiancé (M33) were planning our wedding. Then we went to sleep. Funeral tomorrow.,"My fiancé was also a redditor, therefore feel I have to post something here. To do something as right now it is hard to figure out what.

Last Monday and the weekend before that were so amazing. We went to see our dream apartment that we were planning to buy, we went for lunch with his parents, next day a brunch with his fraternity brothers and their spouses. A beautiful ring on my finger. Wedding in August. Everyone so exicted. He changed his job almost a year ago and on Monday his first big project successfully went into production. He was the hero of the day. I had some impro classes that day, so came home a bit late. He in general was trying to live healthy to look his best for the wedding, but felt like celebrating therefore went to Mc Donalds. A glass of champagne in the evening. A tost, how awesome he is. A cat in the lap that we took as kitten last Easter. As he tends to snore I usually go to sleep a bit earlier we sleep in different rooms. Tuesday morning. I wake up and go to him for our morning cuddle. He is cold. Blue. Blood through nose. I panic, call the ambulance. Then they call the police as he was just 33. I call his mom.

No real reason why. Forensics wrote that something with the heart, but nothing precise as there was no crime, no violence, no poisoning, nothing. A young man just went to sleep and did not wake up.

Planning the funeral that will happen tomorrow. It will be at least twice as big as we were planning our wedding.

Hard to believe that this is really happening. Tomorrow I will see him for the last time ever. I’m spending a lot of time with his parents. He was their only son. All their hopes and dreams were put in him. I have no idea how our relationship will continue with them. We all need each others support, but I know that I cannot replace their son.

Nothing and no one to really blame. Perhaps his ex-girlfriend that was originally the love of his life ho just one day without mentioning a reason just left. During their relationship I know that some drugs were involved, so that probably fucked up his heart a bit more. But since we met, he has been using only some generic antidepressants and sometimes just a bit too much Whiskey, but nothing that could kill a 33 year old.

One thing that helps is the thought about moving out of my current apartment as it would feel too much to keep on living here. I will be moving in with a good friend of mine, therefore I will not be alone. Also I have to take care of the cats - mine that is 10 years old and grumpy and his that is almost 1 year old that is just pure love and positive energy.",1581928557.0,waidelinne,TwoXChromosomes
Just told my husband that I want a separation.,"I feel like crap. I know it was the right thing to do, but I still feel guilty as hell. But that's part of the problem.

The good times are so good with him, but the bad times are so ugly. He has a bad day, he takes it out on me. Never physically, but I suppose that's why I've kept quiet, why I've never left in 15 years. He comes home from a bad day, goes straight to the laundry room without taking off his coat and bag. Huffs while he switches laundry or takes out the trash. Ignores me while I say I love you or welcome home. When I ask him to stop for a moment, take off the bag, give me a hug, he just grumps again and says, ""works gotta get done, SOMEBODY has to do it"". Then that's it for the next hour or rest of the night. I'm shut out because of these things I didn't do - I could be sick, still helping our kids with homework, cooking dinner, mowing the lawn - doesn't matter. He gets in his head what's supposed to be done by the time he gets home, and it's my fault. 

I'm over giving him endless blowjobs with nothing in return but a half-hearted boob squeeze while I get myself off. I'm over his ""foreplay"" of grabbing my vulva while I'm in the middle of cooking dinner or trying to get my son into bed. If I don't immediately respond sexually to his brushing my arm in bed, he rolls over and pouts and I'm REALLY done with that. 

I'm done with him calling me a fucking idiot if I walk the wrong direction and cause us to make a two-block detour to a coffee shop. I'm sick and tired of him rolling his eyes and mumbling ""dumbass"" if I drop something on the floor. He makes me feels so low. 

I'm over it. I'm done. I feel less than my big, beautiful, vibrant self. I walk on eggshells everyday, hoping to keep his temper at bay. No more. I'm done. It hurts, it hurts bad. But I'm done.

I'm financially dependent on him, so I'm sleeping in the guest bedroom. I'm thankful we have a guest bedroom! So I guess I'm not totally done, but it is what it is. Not sure where this will go. I work part-time at his workplace. This is a small town, and I've been trying to get another job for over a year. No luck yet. When I do, I'm going to get my own place, take our son. He works so much, I have to. I want to, but I also have to.

EDIT - Thank you all, didn't think this would get so big! Going to answer people as I can today. I'm feeling even better this morning about my decision. Few tears were she'd last night, it feels like I've already mourned for our marriage.

EDIT 2 - I'd like to address a few things I've read mentioned multiple times. As far as therapy/counseling goes, he is 100% opposed to that. I've brought the topic up many times over the last five years or so. Further, he's made fun of my daughter behind her back that she goes to a therapist. (She's in high school, struggles with anger issues, self-image, and her sexuality.) he feels it's a waste of my money to send her. 

I've tried to talk to him soooo many times, and in so many ways. He has understood for some time now that his actions and words hurt, and he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wasn't going to put up with it forever. Neither of us is perfect, but I can no longer abide being spoken to and treated like his whipping post. I am not his medicine, not his therapy, not his anger management tool. I am his wife, his partner-in-crime, and I cannot continue to make myself smaller and weaker so that he can feel stronger. This was not an overnight decision by any means. 

What I wrote here for all of you was a late-night tl;dr of sorts. I left out so much. The financial control. I left out the many times he has threatened to go blow his brains out because I obviously hate being with him. I left out that he comes from a family of much bigger/worse abuse, and that I make excuses because at least THOSE things didn't happen. I left out so, so much. I left out all the good times that he brought me my favorite bottle of wine because I had just started my period. When he bought items for me from my Amazon wish list just because. When he covered all of his tattoos to meet my grandmother so she wouldn't get upset. When he cried in the dark holding me, telling me that he has never been able to open his heart to someone like this before. The many times we held each other, smiling and laughing along with our son's shenanigans. Ours is simply a life like any other. Nothing special, nothing worth noting. I do hope that my story helps somebody out there. Believe it or not, it was a fellow Redditor's words that gave *me* the final push that I needed to get the ball rolling.

EDIT 3 - His reaction? He was very quiet. He stared at the floor and mostly listed while I laid out my reasons for moving into the spare room as gently but directly as I could. The only words he had for me were ""I'm sorry that I'm a piece of shit"" and ""I'll find a new place to live. I'm know I'm not wanted anymore"". This is pretty much the same reaction he has anytime I have gotten serious about the status of our relationship. In the past, he'd be very kind for a few days, making extra points to make me feel loved and cared for, but it wouldn't last more than a week.

EDIT 4 - Ah yes, the Red Pills finally showed up. For what it's worth, I've never been a stay-at-home mom. I don't give a single care about alimony and child support. If we could make it work, I'd love to co-parent under the same roof, but I don't believe that will be healthy long-term. ",1553493268.0,redopinion209,TwoXChromosomes
Do you have enough tampons?,"When the pandemic was first coming to light, my man went straight in to prep mode. Honestly, I didn't know how big this would become...but he intuitively did. So, when he came home with his first round of supplies, he included two boxes of tampons for me...I didn't ask him to buy them, he just knew they would be needed, and brought them home with a huge bag of rice, cleaning supplies, and other necessities.

Two months in, I got my period, and he asked me ""do you have enough tampons?"" He was very concerned, and wanted to ensure that I would be comfortable.

He can be a real ass at times...but, hearing him ask me that question made me love him even more deeply. He empathized with me about something he will never experience.",1588685442.0,FuckItAll999,TwoXChromosomes
I just realized I masturbate way more than other women. I'm kind of wondering if I should be cutting back.,"I ""play"" multiple times per day. If I'm not on my period, twice per day, before and after sleep. If I get stressed or bored then I like more as well. Less if I'm sad or busy.

I've always had guys say that I have a crazy sex drive, but I thought it was just a hot thing they'd say just because, to make me feel special or something. 

Recently I've been sexting/having phone sex with a guy. For almost a month now. I call him whenever I feel like I want to play and we fool around. When we finish, we wrap it up after chatting about our days. Yesterday when we were chatting, he took a serious and curious tone and asked if I knew why I had such a high sex drive. I brushed off the question at first, and then he explained he meant it, that women tend not to have this much of a drive. He thought it was sexy but wondered if there was a reason for it that I was aware of. I kind of dismissed the question, saying that this is just how I am, and used it as an opportunity to flirt and say how glad I was that he's been talking to me recently. 

But I got curious and googled it. 

These are the numbers I found:

*41% of women have masturbated in the past month (compared to 64% of men), according to a 2017 study.*

*Women masturbate about eight times a month on average, according to a 2016 survey.*

*27% of women masturbate two to three times per week and 26% masturbate once a week, according to a 2019 study.*

8 times a *month*? That's like, a weekend for me. 

Recently I've been thinking that maybe it's not such a Google idea to have the number so high. It is fairly distracting! And I don't have space for real dating in my life right now (just emotionally and time wise). 

Is it healthy to cut back? Is there a healthy way to do that that wouldn't lead to frustration?

Number one

My phone sex buddy was being curious, not a jerk. He's sweet and our arrangement works. He's not threatened by my sex drive, if anything it turns him on and he gets satisfaction from ... My satisfaction lol. Don't worry. So far he's been great. He was not shaming me, he was simply the source of my curiosity to Google.

Number two

Maybe ADHD. I do have trouble staying organized and focused. However I've taken numerous online tests, and most seem to indicate that if I don't have high physical energy and do things like twitching, leg shaking, etc, it's probably something else. But even if it is... I mean, I'm happy enough with how I am mentally. Certainly not enough to change anything significant or be willing to try medications. 

----

Number three

I really liked the input that surveys might under report the frequency at which women masturbate. It's a good theory that makes sense.

----

Number four

Pornography maybe? Yes but no. My libido doesn't change based on my porn usage. I try not to look at porn because I don't support it morally. But even when I used it at my highest, it wasn't that much, and never preferred to a real partner. I don't have issues with addiction unless you count my diet coke addiction (which I have up for January 😁) or video games (an issue in high school, I've moved on).

I get so frustrated when people act like a good healthy relationship is just something that happens.,"My fiancée and I have been together for 3.5 years, living together for 3 years, engaged for a lil over a year.  And honestly, it is the best, healthiest relationship I've ever been in; it's the type of relationship I never could have even imagined before I met her lol.  But one of my biggest pet peeves is when people try to put our relationship on a pedestal/act like we're the standard to live up to, or act like our relationship just happened.  Like yes a bunch of it was just the right person at the right time in the right way but it frustrates me because I feel like it erases all the work we both put into maintaining our relationship.  We've both grown so much individually and as a couple in order to keep our relationship good.  I have to actively work on my communication because I tend to just assume what people are thinking and I also tend to just try to do everything myself to my own detriment.  My fiancée has been working on not shutting down and blocking me out when something is going wrong.   And I feel like loving her is the easiest thing I've ever done, but living with her and living life with another human can be hard.  Like love isn't enough, we have to nurture and work on our relationship to stay as even keeled as we are.  And I just get really frustrated when people act like a good relationship is easy and just happens.  It takes work and I wish the people in our lives would see that more IDK",1724523718.0,oopsbackwards,TwoXChromosomes
How do men still enjoy/push for sex with women who are obviously not interested in or enjoying sex,"Rant warning, this turned out way longer than I expected or meant it to be.

I saw a post about this earlier today and can't find it. I'm assuming it was deleted, as I had saved it to read through more of the comments.

I'm not amazing at articulating this issue, as the post had really just opened my eyes. I would really like to continue this discussion, because I think it needs to be talked about more.

The fact that so many men push after we say no sickens me. I never realized how many times I've expressed uninterest in having sex, only to be pestered into finally giving in just to shut them up.

Eventually the desire just went away. I thought there was something wrong with me. I'm being told how other women want sex more than me. That I must not find the man attractive. That if I'm not having sex with him, I must be getting it somewhere else cuz ""you can't just not want sex"". 

It's always my fault, I'm the problem. They are suffering because I won't put out just to get them off. They ""need sex to feel loved or connected to me"". I must not care about them cuz I'm denying them the one way they feel love.

Then when I finally give in, or just do it cuz ""I guess feeling meh about it, or not knowing if I'm in the mood, is better than being in a hard no mood"", they get upset that I wasn't super into it. That ""it's not enjoyable if I don't really want it"" yet they still push when I say no.

Just no. I don't care if I get into it once they get started. I still said no and it wasn't respected. I get tired of hearing about how horny they are. They are horny all the time. That doesn't mean I have to be their sex toy. I'm tired of being at fault for their arousal because ""just being around you turns me on"". That isn't a compliment, it's not my fault. Just because they get turned on by my presence, doesn't mean it's my job to get them off. I'm tired of ""you are the reason I'm turned on, so you should take care of it"".

Why has this become the norm? Why is their need for sex, more important than my needs in the relationship. I don't care how my love language isn't easy to express, or doesn't come naturally to them! Sex doesn't seem to come easily or naturally to me anymore either! How is it ""not the same"" and ""I should just want sex no matter what"". No consideration for mental health, needs, wants, or enthusiastic consent for that matter.

I'm just tired. I'm not broken. There's nothing wrong with me. I recently asked my obgyn for options on libido boosters. Before they talked about options, they sat me down and said ""if you can and want to please yourself at a level and amount you're happy with, you're libido is fine. It's healthy. That is not a you problem. There is nothing wrong with YOU."" It definitely felt good to be told this, but reading the comments and stories on the other post helped me realize what the real problems were. 

If it is up to me, I will not be deleting this post. It's too important a topic not to keep open. 

Thank you for giving me a place to express this, and thank you for reading.

Rant over lol

Edit for clarity: I am not referring to any one man in particular. I am talking about the fact that the majority of men I have encountered act this way. I'm not saying all men are like this, but I am saying 95% of the ones I have experience with, have been like this. Also, I didn't think I had to spell this out (especially with the bit about my Dr talking to me about libido) but I have a perfectly healthy sex drive. And a pretty high one at that. That's not the issue here. This is about consent not being respected so frequently, that the desire to have sex with another person becomes non existent, or low at best.

"Ladies, I unexpectedly adopted a newborn baby this weekend, and I have had no time to prepare (full story below)! I need new mommy resources, please! Any advice you have is appreciated!","Story time: my brother's girlfriend went to the doctor on Friday for back pain. Doctor looked her over and informed her that it was not back pain, but labor and she was 36 weeks pregnant! She had had no symptoms, regular periods, no weight gain or nausea. Not 24hrs after learning she was pregnant, she birthed a healthy baby boy. 

Now, she and my brother are in their early 20s, but they are not in a financial or relationship place where they can support a baby. Thankfully, my husband and I have been discussing children, although we hadn't decided if we wanted to adopt or have our own child. After hearing of my brother's dilemma, we offered to adopt the baby instead of allowing him to go into foster care. 

TLDR: My son was born 2 days ago, and I have had no time to prepare! Help me, please!!!

Edit: For those who are concerned, the birth parents are both doing well now. The decision to give the baby to us was not difficult for them. They are just SUPER relieved to have an alternative to foster care for the baby.",1565061370.0,KTDid95,TwoXChromosomes
My boyfriend told me that being feminine is for him emotional freedom.,"This goes back a while actually, I can't remember exactly when he told me this exact phrase.I think it when he wore my ""silky black shorts"" that started this because he needed something to wear and was hot. He was at my place and forgot to bring something to wear to bed and wanted to wear something so I had an extra pair of shorts. Just, you know, shorts. To him though, these were like so fascinating. He was so enthralled in touching his own butt! It was just hilarious to me that a simple pair of shorts would be so interesting to him. He'd never worn clothes that were so smooth apparently and it made him feel kinda girly apparently. He really liked being feminine and that is when he said that phrase: ""being feminine is so freeing""At first, I was kinda confused, because, well, honestly being a woman is rather a chore at times. The amount of attention, constant pressure to conform to standards. I hadn't thought about it being freeing to be female.

Then as time went by he started to try other things in our relationship. He painted his nails, and grew his hair out. Nothing really that permanent in any case, but it seemed that he was exploring his personal expression. We talked a lot about how he felt regarding his sexuality and when he came out as Bi to me I wasn't surprised at all. I think he felt really embarrassed. I tried to make him feel good about himself, but I think he really needed these expressions to feel at ease with himself.

I've given it a lot of thought and I think each gender needs aspects of the other that are culturally often kept separate because of the association of being too 'manly' or 'girly'For me, being more like a man in certain ways is freeing. But for him, being more like me is freedom from his own dogma.

I think everyone needs a chance to explore. I'm so glad I know this guy. He is so sweet. The more he can express himself, the more our relationship has grown into a healthy one. I'm really proud of him. :-)

I Asked My Boyfriend To Use Beard Oil,"I asked my boyfriend of 9 months (today, actually) over text to start using beard oil since his scratchy beard would rub against my chin when we would kiss, leaving it irritated and slightly painful.

Before I could let him respond, I was quick to say that I would make sure I kept my hair under control too since, ya know, it's been winter. Particularly, my lady bits.

I felt like I had to justify it, since I felt something along the lines of: ""How dare I add something to his routine just for me? He probably doesn't care about a scratchy beard. I'm just making a big deal out of it."" (Nevermind the fact that he literally drives 40 minutes one way to spend the weekend with me, pretty much every weekend since last August. He does this since he has a car and I have a place to myself. Bless him.) Not because it was actually irritating my skin (but I did mention that to him), not because it was annoying my skin-picking habits, not because of how it was actually affecting me.

Y'all. Since I come from a history of strings of bad relationships and family issues, without getting into them in detail, his response put me over the moon:

""This doesn't need to be a deal for deal kind of thing, I can make my face less scratchy without you having to do anything.""

Like... what? It really struck me. I'm not used to asking someone to change something because it makes me uncomfortable. Even in the past with him, I've always had that weird mental battle to hype myself up and tell myself to speak up about things that make me uncomfortable. He's always been responsive, loving, and gentle with the asks and the baggage that I have from things that have happened to me in the past.

As I'm writing this, I realize it is not an unreasonable request in the slightest, but I had been conditioned to think of any small ask a huge burden on others. My other brain (as we joke) was making me believe that asking him to use a product in his routine was going to make him think less of me, be distant, or what have you when we otherwise have a strong, emotionally healthy, real connection.

I just had to get that off my chest. He is the most amazing man I've ever been with, and I feel like I can't ever show him enough appreciation even though I try my hardest. He has done so much for me, I can't even express it. I'll be sure to give him an even bigger hug tomorrow.

Thanks!

Edit:

Thank you everyone for your incredible words, suggestions, and product tips. We're going to look into this tomorrow evening. I honestly didn't expect this response. Him and I are definitely going to comb through the comments and product hunt! You all are amazing!

Edit 2:

Holy crap! Just really checking this now on my lunch break, thank you for the corrections on the difference between oil, conditioner, balm, wax, etc. I didn't expect this amount of support. Besides the product recommendations, I wanted to thank those who addressed what the post was originally meant to be: finding a healthy relationship and navigating it after being used to ones that aren't.

My boyfriend and I both agree marriage is an outdated tradition. How can I explain the fact I still want to when I don’t even know what those reasons are?,"I also posted this in relationship advice, but I’m posting is here too because 1) in my experience y’all provide the best advice hands down and 2) this sub is a lot more progressive which my boyfriend and me both definitely are. If this isn’t related enough I don’t mind taking it down. 

Him (31M) and I (33F) are madly in love. We knew early on that we’d spend the rest of our lives together and have talked about how cute we’ll be wearing ugly sweaters I’ll knit and playing bridge, and things along those lines. We look at houses we want to buy someday, and have even considered moving to a different country. We have an *extremely* healthy relationship with honest and free-flowing communication. Any problems that may come up, we view as “us versus the problem” rather than “one versus the other”. He’s my best friend. 

Neither of us have been married before. We’ve both always said we want a super small wedding. Basically, I just want to be able to wear a pretty dress somewhere pretty, eat a huge cookie cake (both of our faves) and only our immediate family members need to be there. I’ve showed him in the past a few rings I liked, all of which are less than like $1,000, because again, we want money to go to building our future. He’s even said before he can’t wait until he’s making enough money that I can be his “cute little housewife that can hang out and make art all day”.

Last night, after not talking about marriage for a while, he told me he doesn’t think he wants to get married: that marriage is an outdated tradition (I can see that) that really doesn’t have any legal/financial benefits (I don’t know enough about that) especially since neither of us wants kids, and that it’s not a marriage proves we’ll be together forever—it’s his word telling me he will be. 

I do fully and sincerely trust his word that he wants to be with me for the rest of our lives but.. I do still want to get married and I’m not sure why. I feel like it’s a symbol and declaration of that commitment even though I know the dedication and commitment are already there. I want to be able to say “this is my *husband*” and not just “boyfriend” for the rest of my life. 

However I don’t know how to fully elaborate my feelings and the reason why I feel this way other than just “it’s a public declaration that we’re forever”. I’m just hoping someone can help me find the right words behind my emotions because logically, I’m not sure what those reasons and emotions are. Can anyone relate?

**Update: Thank you everyone for all your detailed feedback!!**

**So, it wasn’t so much that he *changed* his mind as it was that this was the first relationship that prompted him to really, really consider what that would be like.**

**When I explained how important it was for me, he realized how serious and deep it was. He also didn’t realize how expansive the legal benefits and protections it gave both of us.**

**So anyway, we’ve talked it out, and when the time is right that’s what we’re gonna do!**

**Thank you so much!**",1718826124.0,officialspacejam,TwoXChromosomes
"As a girl who ended up not aborting, I am more pro-choice than ever. It is your life.","Hello everyone.


First of all, I would like to apologize in advance for the numerous grammar mistakes I will be making, since English is not my first language. Also, I am very tired and my head is foggy writing this with less than 3-5 hours sleep for the last 2 weeks, so there is a possibility this will be a incomprehensible mess.


Quick back story: I am 21-years-old with a baby who is 1 year and 8 months old. I became pregnant at 19 for my then-boyfriend-ish dude. He isn't really in the picture anymore, with his whole heart. He has his own life with a new girlfriend, he studies, he parties, he goes on vacations. He has a fun and active life. That fun and active life doesn't leave that much of time for our daughter. His effort is maybe once a month, usually a lot less, reaching out to ask how she is doing, otherwise it is 99% of time me who sends the whatsapp messages (who are left unanswered) and calls (who he seems to ignore happily pretty often), trying to get him see our daughter. 


He doesn't pay child support since he is a broke student, but most of all we had a deal of leaving third parties out of this to have his relationship with her as good as possible. In his words, he will make it up with love with what he can't pay. Obviously I am considering to break our ""deal"" since he has 0 respect to it anyway. It will be a long, exhausting fight where I will be the cruel, money-thirsty manipulating bitch, his new girlfriend will see me doing this because I want to sabotage their relationship and he will be the victim.


Anyway, this post wasn't about my ex, I don't know why I wrote about him. Maybe because I just saw his instragram travelling photos from exotic beaches and felt a sting of jealousy and saddness. 


As I said, I was 19 when I became pregnant. You know those girls who say ""I _always_ wanted to be a mother!""? Yeah, I am the complete opposite of that. I can't understand that, like someone would be speaking a different language. What do you even mean with that?? How can someone dream of having children? My first instinct was to abort, immediately after I took the test. I don't like kids. I never wanted to be a mother. I never, for a second, dreamed of having kids in my life. 


My then-boyfriend, took a strong pro-life stand, but made it clear he will respect my choice even if I abort. He didn't push or bully me to anything, let's make that clear. What he did do, though was that he did manipulate me with a rosy view how fun it will be to play with our little kiddo. In his mind it was only ponies and rainbows. I thought we will raise this kid together. He told me so, very clearly.


I did book an abortion date. The days before that after school I spend scrolling through pro-life-websites, youtube-videos, sites (even reddit) where women like me where called a whore, why didn't I use contraception, this is my punishment, I will go to hell for this. I could spend 9-10 hours glued on my phone and fall asleep at 3-4 in the morning, since I was too anxious to sleep. My mom was the only one who was relieved that I will abort and supported me. My crazy religious relative (the nuts one in our family) who got to know about my situation and harassed me that I will ""pay for my sins"". Good stuff like that. 


I live in probably the best country in the world for women. I am _not_ religious. I have never been religious. My country's overall position to abortion is very relaxed and respectful towards the women. The conditions to keep my child as a poor (well, let's be honest, I had no income then, have no income now) woman are the best in the world. We have a fantastic welfare system, free health care, free education. Everything. I saw that a lot on those so called pro-life sites, and have seen them later on. Women who say they are feminist and want the _conditions_ to be so well women don't have to abort. I had those conditions. 


From that day I became pregnant (or let's say, more precisely, that first day when I started to scroll those websites) I have lost my real will to live. That kind of will that makes you dream and enjoy life. That kind of passion where you  _look forward_ to things. Where you are anxious to go to the world and fight for your place in life. Anything can happen, life is so exciting and fun. That was my life before I became pregnant. I had dreams of university, maybe a foreign husband, erasmus, travelling, partying, experiencing.  Learning languages, dancing till the morning, drinking, making friends. 


The day before my abortion I had the worst panic attack, my first. After that there has been plenty. I cancelled my abortion the morning of it. I felt enormous relief. 


Let's be honest about the reasons here: I, a person who was raised in a very non-religious-only-namely-christian household, was convinced I am going to hell if I do this. Yes, you read that right. I would never confess this to anyone else, ever, but I did not keep this baby because I saw a future with her or because I wanted to, I did because I did not see that I could terminate it now. I felt 100% trapped, everything was over. The mistake was already happened, nothing could save me anymore. Either I was going to be a baby-killer or then I was going to have a stupid, boring life. No good options. 


I am more pro-choice today, as a mother for a very challenging but beautiful almost 2 year old, than ever. I know motherhood now. I know what my life is now when I had this child. I lost myself. I am still not in the university because I can't concentrate on reading for the entrance exam with her. I am trying this year, but it won't happen. I am exhausted. Money is tight and it is _very_ strictly controlled, even though because I live in an awesome country I am not missing anything.


More than anything, life is lonely. My friends are living their own life, no one is a mother. I am the boring, frumpy shell that is nothing like what I used to be. I have strecth marks, my boobs are sagging at 21, I am overweight. I had a very difficult and painful birth that still manifestates itself today in form of me having trouble of holding on farts. I don't use make up anymore, nor do I dress up since I don' have money for clothes and I hate my appearance so much there would be no point anyway. Oh I am sorry, I know that when women become mothers appearance and ""superficial stuff"" don't matter at all since we don't care about anything else than our children's welfare. If we do, it is just to please our husbands. Well, I don't have a husband, and I mourn the loss of my looks very much. It affects my self esteem.


I am perfectly aware how society even the most feminist, free countries in the world sees single mothers. I am a fuck up, a mess up, I was ""pumped and dumped"", I deserve this. No good man wants me anymore. I have lost even the boys who used to be my friends, not to mention when my boyfriend left us absolutely no one was interested in me anymore.


I spend my days with my little human. I take care of her, I feed her, I bathe her, I play with her, I go to the park with her, I read to her. I am constantly, absolutely constantly, scared of parenting her wrong. I try to learn about parenting methods which I can't seem to really keep up with in real life. 


Now, let's get to the important part of my mindless, long rambling: **I love her**. With all my heart. I have short times of immense joy with her. My life is for her. I am trying to get into university in a field that would have 9-16 days so I can construct my life around her.  I will fight with everything I have to ensure she has a good life. 


If I was sent to that day right now, holding my phone with shaking hands, convinced I have to cancel my abortion, would I still do it? No. I wouldn't. I would abort. 


People don't like extremely complicated answers, answers that actually reflect life that is hard and has a million different view points. They want ""oh not aborting was the most wonderful decision of my life, my child gave me a reason and happiness and everything"". They don't want young women with no realistic opportunities to support themselves without the help of the government to have children, but will judge those who abort.  


If I could, I would go back and abort in a heart beat, actually understanding what it means to stay up alone all by yourself, be left my your boyfriend who has the freedom to just merrily fuck off to his exciting student-life bubble with our old friends. I would understand how taxing the bodily, mental and hormonal changes are. I would understand, than once you have a child _that's it_. Your life is over, or at least put on on hold, and you _never_ get life or those precious years of freedom,  fun, studying and networking back. The reason people make babies in stable marriages is because parenting is FUCKING HARD. It is FUCKING EXHAUSTING. I would give _anything_ in this world to do this when I am significantly older, with a supporting husband, living our on own money, in house. It would be wonderful to have that now, but still it wouldn't be what I really want in life. It would still be a second-place good. 


I don't need help, or reassuring, or cheering or ""it will be get better when that baby reaches age x""-thing. Nor I am looking for compassion. I know clear well my post comes off as a selfish, whining bitch. That's how women are seen. We have a motherhood myth, and if you don't fit in you are a monster. I don't need advice or ""why don't you just adopt/quit bitching and enjoy what you have/at least you have a healthy child/most people have it worse"". I don't give a fuck. I know perfectly well I am a good mom and will be a good mom, and I will do everything for her. However I don't like it, I don't like my life. Its lost. 


I have been to the doctor and yes I am depressed. I don't need ""this is your post natal depression speaking, it will get better when you get sleep, when she is an adult you are grateful for her blah blah, you would be depressed anyway"". I don't believe depression being an illness that just pops out randomly for no reason at all. I am depressed because I hate my life and have no way out, and the reason it is because I hate being a mother. You can reverse every single thing in life except having kids and death. 


**TL;dr**: Women who are pregnant and thinking whether or not to abort: Do not give a single fuck for _any_ outside opinion. Not the opinion of your boyfriend, or even husband, relative, friend, church member, whatever (I know the husband and boyfriend-part will trigger a massive roar, don't care.) . Look at _your_ life in the future, what you want, and then act accordingly. Keep your child ONLY if you WANT TO BE A MOTHER. Everything else, finances, relationships, people shaming and guilt-tripping you, is bullshit. I am **not** encouraging anyone to abort. I am saying that in the end no one else will be there, and it will be you and only you, with your one, unique life. It needs to be _your_ decision you know you can live with the rest of your life. Those people wanting to influence you are not going to care or help you in the end. 



The end. 


**Edit**: I have to go now and it can take me a long time until I get back (I can't be on phone or computer when I am with my kid) , so I am upset I can't answer to each and every post made here, but. Please know that all your positive messages have made a huge impact on me. I am in tears. I shared something painful and instead of a few trolls and ignoring, I got to have so encouraging and beautiful messages and other women sharing their feelings and life situations. I thank all of you for your PMS (except the trolls) and your messages. I will read all of them and try to answer to as much as I can.


And to that person who gave me gold, I have no words. Just... Thank you. Thank you so much.


**Quick edit 2 since this is important**: I would never say to my daughter that she wasn't really wanted,  and I will do everything I can ever to feel the complete opposite. I will never tell her anything what really happened when I considered my options. I've always said to her I loved you since the moment I knew you were coming and that she is my greatest gift, and those things are true. My daughter is the light of my life, and I don't blame her on anything, what I do blame is myself and wish that women could have more support. I know my feelings are more complex than mothers are allowed to have, but to those asking if I hate my daughter that is the last sentiment I have. I will be the best I can for her, and I am sticking to my decision.



**Edit 3** : Good god I am shaking. I don't understand what is happening here. I am honestly in a state of shock. I thought I would just quickly check this before crashing since I can hardly keep my eyes open, and came back to blown up inbox of hundreds of messages, _four fucking golds_,  this is being in the r/all. I can't wrap my head around what is happening.


Your messages. Your private messages. It would be impossible for me to try to put in words how I am feeling right now. It would be too little to say that I am overwhelmed. I have read message after message with my hand covering my mouth since I can't take all these people reaching out to me, telling their stories and sharing how they feel about their situations that are from every perspective of this issue, people sending just LOVE, just lovely, encouraging, loving messages for a complete stranger (and yes so, so many hateful trolls too, btw I don't read further immediately when I spot on a message that was mean simply to hurt). I don't know what to do with all this love. My heart is beating so fast.


It would be absolutely impossible for me to go through all of them right now, it is very late and I have spend much longer on this than I really could. I will read each and every single of them and reply to as many as I possibly can.


I can't believe just letting the world see my ugly raw hopelessness and feelings of being trapped could open a gate like this. I dwell on these thoughts hour to hour, day to day alone, month to month, usually when grandma takes my daughter to her so I can have a short break I write to myself in my diary. I can't believe the amount of women reaching out and sharing how they feel. 


As I said, I am not religious, but I believe in the universe. But let's just say I've have a _very_ hard couple of months, and _extremely_ hard couple of days, especially this day. i think. I think I was supposed to write this. Something has cracked inside of me, I can't handle my emotions right now but this, this has been more therapeutic than the 7 months I have spent with a professional. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is some kind of turning point for me. I feel it.



I don't know how to say thank you. Thank you. Just **thank. you**. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I am going to drink about 6 liters of water to hydrate myself after all this crying and then I think I am going to lay down to the bed and be actually able to breath without the heavy feeling of creeping pain and soul-crushing anxiety blocking it. Then I am going to sleep well. For the first time in so long I don't want to write it. I just know it. 



Since I have this one short chance to say how I feel about this and maybe reach out to someone (also because I received so many of those messages of how I promote and encourage abortion), I will repeat this in a shorter way: **Nothing else matters than your own, personal, deep desire and inner voice on choosing what to do. It has to be YOUR choice. Do it ONLY if it TRULY is YOUR choice. Nothing else should do, since nothing else really matters.** Everything and everyone trying to manipulate, influence, bully, shame, or convince you is indifferent. It should go without saying, but since it was confusing to so many people, this applies to those women wanting to keep your baby but feeling that you are too much of x, have too much or too less of x or are being pushed by a partner/parent/important person in your life to abort. That decision _will_ hurt you, greatly.


Let's get through this one more time: your marital status, age, education, wealth, what the society and community thinks, your image, how religion/someone from the outside views your decision, every single one of those are not what should be the reason you do what you do. ""But women are struggling to conceive so I should feel lucky, but my married lover wants me to abort, but I have everything I need in life, I am ready"", do not give a single fuck if it goes against your inner voice. If it comes from the outside, it is not yours, and you will have more than a hard time living life that is not yours. If it is, you will find a way to cope with everything and anything that comes along the way, since nothing in life is a greater motivation, source of power than knowing what you are doing comes from you.


And lastly for those attacking me for bringing up the pro-life propaganda and how much it affected me, being skeptical about how it can get through to someone like me: when you are a confused hadly-an-adult, in a situation that is so panicking you feel like you are in the roof of a burning apartment with no opportunities to save yourself, with a huge hormonal rush, not knowing what to do (or more like thinking you aren't supposed to do what you want to do), you submit to powers you would normally not pay a second to. And I consumed that shit _a lot_. I understand it is hard to understand for an outsider, but when you are in a state of complete vulnerability feeling like it is something too big for you to decide, it is easier to listen to someone who says they know exactly what is right for you even if you know it isn't. They use stuff that cuts down to your emotions and really fucks up your mind.


I am not blaming my boyfriend, my internet habits, or anyone outside for my decision. I take full responsibility of what happened. No one forced me with a gun to do anything, even though it felt like it in some way. But just like it was my choice, I should have seen it truly is _only_ my choice and absolutely no one is invested in that I am.


And that is my goal for women to realize. I belive we are strong together and should celebrate and look out for each other. Womanhood is a beautiful but hard thing and we need to help each other. Thank you, you wonderful ladies and gentlemen. I will get back to all of you soon.


Thank you for giving me hope, since that is what I got from this. Hope. So much hope. I am now going to bed with a lighter heart I've had in years.",1490447998.0,sotiredinlife,TwoXChromosomes
My boyfriend took care of me when I was too drunk to have sex and refuses to let me feel guilty that I couldn’t follow through on my promises.,"FINAL EDIT 4 MONTHS LATER: turns out my boyfriend was an emotionally abusive asshole. You live and you learn. Just because someone does a good thing doesn’t mean they’re a good person. Fuck you and the control you had over me.

Edit: As a disclaimer, I am NOT condoning drinking to excess. My boyfriend and I are still fairly young (19 and 22) and we like to go out and have fun every once in a while. You have to push your limits to find them. I will always be conscious of my alcohol intake and ensure that if I feel it is becoming a problem I will seek help (edited:phrasing), and I would encourage anyone who has problems with alcohol or uses it as a coping mechanism, or to hurt yourself, to seek help and the support of people who care about you. Drinking until you’re about to puke isn’t cool or funny, it can be very stupid and dangerous. That being said, I was in a safe environment with safe people who would not let anything happen to me. I am aware of the consequences of drinking a lot of alcohol and whether or not I choose to drink is my decision as an adult (legal drinking age is 18 where I am from). 

A few nights ago, my boyfriend and I went clubbing and were out all night. We started drinking around 11pm and didn’t leave the club until 6am, with both of us drinking and dancing for just about the whole time. My boyfriend and I are still a fairly new couple (officially in a relationship for just over a month), so without trying to sound too r/ihavesex, our sexual appetite for each other is very healthy. The whole night, when we were dancing alone together or standing next to each other, we would whisper to each other the things that we were going to do when we got home that night. After we’d had enough to drink that we didn’t really care who saw, he’d keep grabbing my butt and I’d push it against him when I was dancing on him. Yknow, drunk horny couple stuff. Anyway, there was a very clear agreement between the two of us that we were gonna get pretty nasty that night, and we were both pretty excited about this. 

When it came to the last couple of hours before the club closed, I began feeling a bit sluggish, which can be expected considering how long we’d been out for, so in my drunken state I thought I could cure this feeling with a nice shot of tequila. I was already feeling kind of sick, but this was the final nail in the coffin; within a few minutes, I was desperately trying to find somewhere to lie down as this usually stops me from feeling dizzy and sick when I’m intoxicated. I lay down on a couch and my boyfriend put my head in his lap and stroked my hair, asking if I needed anything like water. Eventually I just went into the bathroom for a while, attempting to puke, while the friend that we came in with guarded my stall and drunkenly tried to encourage me when she heard me gagging. Edit: I was never actually sick in the end, despite my attempts. I didn’t black out either. 

The whole time, my boyfriend sat outside by himself waiting for me. When I came out, he put his arms around me and asked if I wanted to go home. I mumbled something about not wanting to ruin the night for him and our friend, but he just took me to get my coat and we left. We got a cab home and he catered to all my drunk/sick brain’s requests: please make the cab driver turn the music off, please let me open the window, please let’s just go straight home (occasionally if he’s run out of cigarettes my boyfriend will ask the cab to drop us at the nearest shop, and I knew he was out of them so he would wanna go but he didn’t even mention it, we just went home).

When we got back I was dreading the idea of us going to his room and having to have sex - my head was pounding and I felt like I was going to be sick at any minute. I said nothing and we went to his room. Immediately he had me lie down, take off any uncomfortable clothing i.e. shoes and a harness I was wearing, and he went and got me some water and one of his hoodies in case I needed to get up to be sick so I wouldn’t be cold. When he came back he just laid down, made sure I was comfortable and put his arms around me. I nearly cried, I felt so cared for by him, he didn’t make any attempt to have sex with me or even kiss me more than I would have wanted him to. 

I know this doesn’t sound like a big deal, but after being a victim of both sexual assault and ex-boyfriends guilting me into sex when I really didn’t want to, I’m just really grateful that my boyfriend was so sweet to me and didn’t even bring up the fact that I couldn’t follow through on what I’d been teasing him with all night. After I apologised the next morning, all he said was that I had nothing to apologise for, and that he loved me and all he cared about was making sure I was okay. 

Ladies (and anyone, of course): this is the standard and should be the only acceptable response to a person obviously being too unwell, unwilling or unable to have sex. Do not allow any form of guilt tripping or “you owe me’s” like I used to. It’s sad that I feel like this is something I have to thank somebody for, rather than simply being able to expect that level of respect from another human being. I do feel a bit guilty that I teased him so much and he may have been a little disappointed, but if he is, he hasn’t let on at all. 

(Ironically, we went out again the next night and exactly the same situation happened but with the roles reversed. He began feeling sick when we got home and so I knew exactly how to take care of him because he had done the same for me.)

TLDR; I partied with my boyfriend and we kept talking about how much sex we were gonna have that night, I teased him for hours but then I got sick from drinking too much and he took care of me and didn’t make me feel bad about not being able to follow through on my promises. I still feel quite guilty and like I blue balled him, but he’s been nothing but amazingly sweet and caring and I’m just very thankful.

Edit 2: (copying and pasting a response to someone questioning why I was implying that this isn’t normal behaviour for men to exhibit): Oh no don’t get me wrong it’s definitely the norm and I’m sure most guys would behave in just as respectful a manner! I’m just saying that in my experience, I’ve unfortunately been with a few men who haven’t treated me so well and I know that while it may not be the majority, a lot of people still end up in abusive situations where they feel they owe their partner sex no matter what. Just wanted to celebrate this positive experience and share it in the hope that it might help or encourage somebody else like it has with me :)

Edit 3: Help, [the MGTOW have arrived](https://imgur.com/EgFBP6F)

Edit 4: I understand the “this is a stupid post, this is normal behaviour there’s no need to celebrate it” but I am a little tired of explaining that in my life, I haven’t been with a truly good person until now. As I mentioned, I have been assaulted by ex boyfriends in the past, or guilted into doing things that I didn’t feel up to doing. For that reason, it is much more meaningful to me as an abuse survivor when my new partner shows me this type of respect than it may be to someone who has not experienced such abuse (and it is great that there are people who haven’t experienced it). To those who don’t understand, I am truly happy that you have never had to experience the things that myself and other abuse victims have experienced, and it is because of that that I can’t be angry when you’re saying things like “who cares, your boyfriend just acted like a normal person”. Of course he did, his behaviour is the basic standard that we should hold everybody to when it comes to consent. But some people aren’t so lucky that everybody treats them this way. Those are the people that my post is for.

Edit 5 (hopefully my last): thank you so much to everyone who is leaving kind and supportive comments, I’m a bit overwhelmed by it and there’s a lot of them... so I can’t reply to them all but please know I’m reading them, reading your stories and I send you all nothing but best wishes, especially those of you who are expressing understanding for my feelings because you have also been in abusive situations before. I hope no one has to go through any of what we have been through anymore and I hope this helps in some way to show us how we deserve to be treated. Thank you everyone :)",1556542826.0,Recifeeder,TwoXChromosomes
Please be kind to people who are estranged from their mothers,"A gentle reminder that not everyone is fortunate enough to have a healthy relationship with their mother, and exhibiting a bit of kindness and understanding instead of disbelief and judgement when someone says that they won't be speaking to or visiting with their mother on mother's day goes a long way for that person. For some of us, our mental health depends on that estrangement, even if the void of that figure is deeply felt. 

Edit: On the Friday before Mothers day, I thought there may be a handful of people that had been dealing with unkind comments who could use some understanding and kind words. I did not anticipate this outpouring. I will try to respond to each and every one of you who have shared stories. I thank you for the courage it takes to share them. I know how hard it can be. If this has helped anyone to find some healing, that is way more than I could have hoped. As some have mentioned, it is always a good philosophy to be kind no matter what. Love to you all.

"""Open Communication"" -People's favourite way to blame women for the things that happen to them.","So, I've been on a few subs recently, mostly pregnancy/relationships and the one common piece of advice that I see being given (by men and women) is ""open communication"". Sure, open communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, but seriously, telling someone who is complaining that their SO is an incompetent child that open communication is a way to ""fix"" their relationship is absurd. Having reasonable expectations in a relationship is pretty standard in a relationship. 

Ladies, don't let yourself take the blame for having reasonable expectations. You're not at fault for feeling some emotions that you feel when absolute basics aren't met.

""YoUR BoYfRIeND iS NoT PSycHic"" - but he is a human being, right? Men/women out there really implying that if it hasn't been explicitly documented, then it doesn't count.

Edit: Thank you for all your responses. I didn't expect this post get as much attention as it did. If you're still on the fence about this post, read the 100+ comments where women and men have detailed where you need to draw the line on communication or the conditions in which communication doesn't work. 

I'm not anti-communication. It would be ridiculous of me to even consider it. But if you feel like you are being taken for granted, if your boundaries are being crossed, if you feel like you have to constantly remind someone to be a good human being, then that's not fixable through communication.",1683430639.0,MuggleWitch,TwoXChromosomes
My boyfriend was disgusted by a woman’s post-baby tummy,"We were watching a reality tv show where at one point you could see a woman’s stomach. She was a normal healthy woman but it was clear that she was mother.

“That is disgusting. Why are they showing that on tv?” 

I was horrified by his comments and it really made me reconsider the whole relationship. It shows that he’s sexist and stupid, that he believes only women that he finds attractive are allowed to show their stomach on tv, that he will probably find my body disgusting if I ever have a child.

His arguments were that he grew up in a more conservative culture than me and he finds certain things inappropriate to show to other people and on tv. He was comparing it to how earlier in the program you could see a guy naked from behind and even a bit of his dick as he was swimming naked in the ocean.

Although I don’t have issues with nakedness I can understand his point of view that he’s uncomfortable with actual nakedness, such as the naked guy in the program, but that is in no way comparable to a woman’s stomach. And I’m sure there were other exposed stomachs in the program but it was only the “disgusting” one with a bit of excess skin that he had a problem with.

Edit:
- It was not a right after pregnancy belly. It was just a healthy, in good shape, woman who had a bit of loose, wrinkly skin which must have been from pregnancy.

- He also said something about it being weird/disgusting about the naked man earlier in the program but the man was actually naked as opposed to the woman who just showed her stomach for a brief moment.

- He has never made similar comments about half naked (attractive) women on tv before.",1613397765.0,DesignerDirt2743,TwoXChromosomes
Sick and tired of predatory men making me feel like my body isn’t my own,"Edit: wow, I did not expect this to blow up!! Thank you for the overwhelming amount of support, you all. You’re lovely and I really appreciate it. To everyone in my DMs calling me a whore and sending me rape threats: suck my dick and choke on it, assholes. No one cares about your shit opinions. **Also I appreciate the awards, but instead please donate the money you’d spend on those to** [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org), **a charity which helps the victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, which is the behavior I have described here in its most extreme form.** Thank you!!

This is gonna be rambly because I’m tired and pissed off but anyway... I went to the pharmacy today to pick up a prescription. I wore kind of a tight shirt because I like the way it looks and also every shirt that’s medium or under is kind of tight on me because boobs so, if I want to wear clothing that fits, then it’s kind of a given. Anyway. While I was standing in line, three men out of five who passed me looked at my boobs. Three adult, graying, old-enough-to-be-my-dad men. I’m only 19... it makes me feel guilty and unclean, somehow, for existing in this body. 

I don’t know how to say this. I want it to stop. I want to stop feeling like my body is a spectacle without my consent. I want to be able to wear what I want and not be on edge the whole time and I want to be able to look happy and approachable and express joy in public without being singled out by some man who makes me feel afraid. I hate, HATE that being a woman means I’m always somehow inherently at risk. Whenever I go out, I have to constantly be on guard. It’s exhausting. I hate being subjected to the male gaze while going about my life and having my personhood ripped away in the name of some sexual fantasy. I deserve respect!!!! I am a person!!!!! Why does everyone seem to feel entitled to just say the most disgusting things to me because of how I look??? I don’t understand it and I hate it. 

I would never want to be a man. But I hate that being a woman means I must be subjected to this. It’s utterly exhausting. I feel like I’m being worn down, gradually, and that I’m just gonna snap and go a little bit apeshit on the next rando who makes some unsolicited comment to me. I want to reclaim my existence, reclaim my body, but I don’t know how. I’m exhausted. I’m angry. And idk, I’m probably just throwing a fit and making a big deal over something I’m just going to have to learn to live with, but still...

I keep thinking about how, pre-covid, I went to the state fair with some friends and as we were walking, a worker came up behind me, grabbed my shoulder, spun me around, and said “you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, whats your Instagram?” and just completely disrespected my boundaries and personal space as if I would just give him my personal information because of a compliment. I did not know this man at all. He *grabbed* me. I was speechless. 

And how last semester, a man I trusted and adored manipulated me both emotionally and physically into sleeping with him despite him having a girlfriend. Im still coming to terms with the fact that he only saw me for my body while I thought we were best friends. He got me crossed or stoned every time I would come over and then would push my boundaries just a bit more every time and I’d give in because I wasn’t sober. He used the fact that I trusted him and that I was inebriated and incapacitated to his advantage. Months later, I still feel violated and hurt. (Edit: it has come to my attention that this is sexual assault, holy shit. Also the gf thing is complicated. The relationship was open but no, I was not homewrecking. I would never do that)

Or how random men on Reddit slide into my PMs and say just... the most utterly vile things to me, as if I’d been posting on some gonewild subreddit looking for that kind of sexual interest, which I never have and never would do (not that there’s anything wrong with that!! Just not my thing). I’m just tired. So tired. Anyway, I’m running out of steam... thanks for listening to my rant, if u got this far. Sending you all love, and please keep yourselves safe and healthy!!",1604222712.0,oh_its_em,TwoXChromosomes
I feel like my (F20) boyfriend (M27) sees me as a “project” and wants to change me into his ideal version.,"


I feel as if my boyfriend sees me as a “project”, doesn’t give me a chance to grow and mature on my own, and wants to mold me into what he thinks is the perfect version of myself. I’m conflicted because maybe he’s just trying to put me on the right track, but at the same time I feel like I can’t be who I really am around him. 

One thing he doesn’t like is the fact that I smoke/consume weed, and occasionally drink. I can count on one hand how many times I smoke weed within a month and I only drink and smoke when I’m hanging out with friends. Still it’s an issue for him, he says it’s “unhealthy for my womb”. 
He gets on me about my credit score, saving habits, who I’m friends with, lifestyle choices, etc 

When we first got together he kept wanting me to watch this religious show and take me to church. I believe in God but I’m not heavy on religion like he is. 
The biggest thing is he wants to get married this year, move, settle down, and have kids soon. 

So I feel he is trying to “fix” and mold me into someone I’m not right now. Eventually I want those things but not right now. And I’m starting to think if I am better off single than in a relationship, because while I don’t dislike him as a person, I dislike being in a relationship and all the responsibilities and compromises that come with it.

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants to change me, disapproves of my choices, and pushes for marriage and religion. I'm considering if I'd be happier single.

EDIT: I’ve been reading all of your comments and just wanted to thank you all for the advice but one thing I wanted to say and I’m not sure if it’ll change anything is when he mentioned smoking being “unhealthy for my womb” I think it was more of a language barrier thing as my boyfriend is not American so some things he says may come across different. He meant he wanted my body to be healthy for pregnancy but I guess he just said it wrong again, it may not change anything it just wanted to clear that up.

Last EDIT: Thanks all again for the insightful advice. I will admit, this being my first relationship I don’t know if I’m strong enough to end things right this minute but it’s definitely something I’m going to sit down and really think about and give myself the end of the month to make my decision. Just to clear more things up, he knew I used weed when we met, I’ve already brought up the compromise of using edibles but he’s just anti-drugs in general. 

I like weed and I’d rather find someone who’s the same than give it up completely, that’s just me. The whole saving and credit score has to do with him pressuring me to move with him and saying he won’t be able to pay the bills or whatever by himself and keeps mentioning us getting a car together rather than my own car, his words and reasoning. Either way reading all the comments, it’s clear to me were incompatible and I’ve honesty felt that way from the very beginning but don’t know what I was thinking ending up this deep into it. So yeah, I’m in therapy now and hopefully I’ll find the will to leave sooner.",1694523008.0,Ahnannahmus,TwoXChromosomes

What does a healthy relationship look like?,"Hi! In my personal experiences with male partners, they have been emotionally neglectful and unavailable, at times crossed physically boundaries, unable to resolve interpersonal problems (and not just inside the relationship), etc.

I am in therapy and working through a lot of past things that shaped my understanding of relationships. I'm hoping that by improving and healing myself, I will, at the very least, be able to recognize and avoid unhealthy patterns. 

But how the heck do I identify what is healthy when it comes to romantic relationships? Since I have minimal experience with healthy relationships. 

If you found a healthy partner and have or have had healthy romantic relationships, could you please share the top things or the patterns you've noticed that stood out as big green flags? And what boundaries and standards do you hold that keep the relationship healthy or help you identify and stay away from the unhealthy ones?",1729264921.0,Objective-Road9883,TwoXChromosomes
"I put myself back out there, and I got absolutely crushed. I’m so grateful.","Backstory: About a year ago, I left a toxic and abusive situation. I have dedicated the past year of my life to rebuilding and trying to be healthy. I’ve lost a good amount of weight and my face healed up nicer than I thought it would (without surgery). This has been coupled with intense therapy and yoga/meditation. 

Fast forward to about two months ago, I decided to put myself back out there. I don’t really know anyone in my city, so I turned to Tinder. I immediately hit it off with “Steve”. I gave him my number, and about a week later we had our first date. It was the best first date I’ve ever been on, and 3 days later we had our second. This led to us seeing each other about 3x a week, and we were hitting it off. Steve is seriously the most thoughtful guy I’ve ever dated. He would tell me I was beautiful and intelligent frequently, and as we progressed we started sleeping together (and it was ELECTRIC). 

Fast forward to last night. I invited him over, we had romantic time, and then ate pizza and watched Netflix. After, we go to have sex again. For some reason, I had a flashback to my ex and freaked out. I pushed him out of me, and ran to the bathroom and had a full blown panic attack. He calmed me down. he hugged and kissed me. I kept apologizing and saying how terrible I was and how I didn’t deserve his patience. He reassured me he still liked me, confirmed our plans for Saturday night and he left. 

At 2am, he texted me that I was a great person but he couldn’t see me anymore. He said he suspected I’d been through some trauma and that I should get help, and that he couldn’t give me the attention I want. 

Oh lord, that cut so so deep. I woke up at 4or 5 and saw that text, and was physically ill. I waited until this morning and I apologized. I told him (in very limited terms) about my past relationships. I told him I was seeking help. I asked him for a second chance. He said no. His exact reply was “I just don’t think I can do it, but I wish you well”. 

BUT YALL: I am so grateful. I’m grateful that a wonderful, handsome man  was interested in me. I’m grateful that I had feelings for him, because honestly before him i wasn’t sure if I’d ever be attracted to anyone ever again. And I’m grateful that it hurts—- because that means I’ve moved out of a constant state of pain where I probably wouldn’t even have noticed before. I’m grateful for new opportunities, and I’m grateful he let me go to find them. And mostly, y’all, I’m just so damn grateful and proud to still be standing. 

TLDR: I got my heart broken but I’m gonna survive.

"People in healthy, long-term relationships - what does healthy anger, frustration, and irritability look like to you?","Coming from a very violent home and only abusive romantic relationships so far... I really never saw what ""healthy anger"" looks like. 

For me, anger from a partner is scary, unpredictable, and something that causes physical and emotional pain. Frustration and irritability are linked for me as well, as something that will inevitably lead up to explosive rage or anger, and if it doesn't, I try to walk on eggshells to make sure the explosion doesn't happen, to soothe the frustration before it gets worse. Angry people make me anxious, extremely willing to submit and cave into whatever they want, or shut down completely and numb out until I can't really remember what even happened. And on the flip side, because I am so used to suppressing my fear, I become overly sensitive to appeasing others, resentful, don't know how to confront bad behavior or stand up for myself, and inevitably have meltdowns in private because I am just completely overwhelmed. I don't blame people for being able to express themselves, but I do just internalize everything because I am scared in a way that makes my body react like I'm about to die lol..

I really want to know what normal, healthy people experience. When you're angry at your partner, do you ever yell or raise your voice? Do you ever criticize, rant and rave, become confrontational and combative and ""blinded"" by emotion? Or do healthy people know how to restrain themselves so that anger doesn't ever bubble all the way to the top? Do healthy couples just never get to a point where that kind of rage and anger is a part of their lives at all? Does the problem just become resolved through talking and taking some time away to take a breath?

This sub needs a course on abusive relationships because some of y’all don’t seem to understand them at all.,"I see these comments constantly “why didn’t you just leave” “why did you have children with this person” “you need leave, why are you letting this person do this to you and your children”. I don’t think most of you understand how abusive relationships work.

I was in an abusive relationship for six years. He was never physically abusive though there were times he was close to it. Most of the abuse I endured was mental/emotional and sexual abuse. I stayed in the relationship for as long as I did because I came from a history of abuse, and because I didn’t know what a real relationship was supposed to be like. My dad was emotionally and mentally abusive to me growing up. I knew nothing else. I didn’t know what real love was supposed to feel like. I already had bad self esteem going into the relationship and he managed to make me feel so bad that I thought no one else would want me. Why make the effort with anyone else when I was damaged and broken? There were times he showed me “love” and somehow that made it worth it to me. It took me six years to realize that was not right, and then he still had a grip on me after I left, texting me, calling me, emailing me, telling me all these lovely things, making me think he was going to be better. I was broken and weak, I did not get back with him because he moved (in his words “to start a real family with someone healthy, normal, and sane”) but I had a string of hookups and relationships after that did nothing but hurt me even more, because I felt that’s all I deserved.

When someone pushes you down so hard, every single day, they make you feel like you can’t leave. You can’t do anything. No one else will ever love you. Many of these women coming here for advice have never experienced anything other than abuse, so that’s all they know. And that’s why they continue to be in these relationships.

Not to mention there may be other factors such as money (spouse may control income or they cannot support themselves alone), children, lack of support. Leaving an abusive relationship is a dangerous time depending on the level of abuse, and may in some cases lead to violence if the abuser finds out about plans to leave. Some of y’all act like it’s so easy to up and leave. Women’s shelters are overrun and some do not have room for children and pets. These are fair obstacles to consider when someone is trying to leave an abusive relationship.

The worst part is when I see comments from people that have endured abuse in their past and their comment amounts to “well I did it so you should be able to too”, with a very “pull yourself up by your fucking bootstraps” tone. I’ve encountered so many women like this it makes me physically ill. You don’t know what someone’s situation is like, never compare, never say “I do this so you can too” but man I see so many of y’all do this.

I thought this was supposed to be a sun for supporting women but a lot of y’all have nothing better to do than drag other women down and shame them when they’re in a moment that they need the most help.

I should be allowed to exist peacefully.,"I have body issues. I was raped when I was 15 and turned to food which made me very overweight. I think part of the reason I put on so much weight is because I subconsciously wanted to be unattractive to avoid being the target of a predator again. 

Well anyways, I’m in a pretty good long term relationship, and my view in sex is a lot healthier now. And because of this, and anti depressants, I’ve been motivated to lose weight and get healthy. I’ve lost 23 lbs (yay!) and today I was actually feeling confident. I put on a shirt today that I’ve never worn because it was too small but I had it for a while. It’s a little tight but it finally fits. I’m still not happy with my body, but I was feeling good, the shirt fit, and it was 93 degrees today. Not that it matters, but it’s a crop top, which is not something I’d normally wear. Ever. I just don’t normally have the confidence. 

So I’m walking into a McDonald’s because I’m picking up food for DoorDash and this guy right outside really loudly says “Hey Girl” and walks towards me like a man on a mission. I immediately start to panic and I quickly get inside the store. I thought he was going to follow me inside but he didn’t, so for a second I’m relieved, but then I look behind me and I see him staring at me super intensely through the window while holding his crotch area. 

ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!?!? WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT? Do you think I exist just for you? Do you think I like that? What’s the matter with you? 

I one time ONE TIME I wear a crop top this happens. The ONE TIME I start to feel confident you do this. You do NOT get to use my body, physically or mentally, for your pleasure without my permission. I am NOT yours to take. I am NOT an object. Have some fucking decency. Have some respect. Fucking asshole. 

Now all I want to do is binge eat a gazillion calories and crawl into my bed wearing 100 layers of baggy unappealing clothing. I want to stop showering or going to work or wearing cute clothes or putting on make up. I want to make myself disgusting and gross and unappealing to stop being a target.

You’re not “wrong” for wanting less sex.,"If you’ve been on Reddit for any length of time, I’m sure you’ve seen these posts asking for advice — often by men who want their partners (usually women) to have more sex and she seems uninterested, or by women who are struggling to meet their partners’ (who are usually men) expectations.

In my ongoing project to mitigate the absolute harm Reddit is doing to people’s knowledge of how to have pleasurable, consensual sex, let’s take this on.

People giving “advice” in these situations too often come at it from the perspective that *more sex is better.* **This is ridiculous.**

People can have happy, healthy romantic relationships without *ever* having sex — asexual people exist, and their romantic relationships are **not** just “roommates” or “friendships.”

Assuming no one in the relationship is asexual, though, there is STILL no “correct” or “optimal” amount of sex for people in relationships to have sex.

People can be perfectly happy having sex once a month or once a day. Neither is inherently better.

**When there is a mismatch in how much sex people in a relationship are having, we must not default to assuming that the partner who wants to have *less* sex is in the wrong.**

People, especially men, are often socialized to feel that sex is **the** primary, most valid expression of romantic affection, love, and desire. (See also: people who claim that their “physical touch love language” is primarily about sex rather than any other forms of touch and people who use the word “intimacy” to mean sex, which sidelines the fact that non-sexual intimacy is equally valid).

We are also socialized to believe that “spontaneous desire” is the valid, optimal form of desire or arousal — this is a form of desire or arousal that most *men* feel far more often than most women.

This is harmful for many reasons.

First, it socializes people (especially women) to feel that they **must have sex when their partner wants it** because “that is just what you do in a relationship” or “men need sex to feel loved.” 

*If you feel you must have sex when your partner wants it, please read my previous post on coercion. If your partner claims to only feel loved when you are having sex with him, ask him why he can love his mom without fucking her.*

Second, it means that people very often do not understand *what* is happening when they or their partner *do not* experience spontaneous arousal. “But my partner says she loves me! If she really loved me, she’d give me spontaneous blow jobs or a quicky before lunch!” “But I love my partner! Why don’t I get super horny at the drop of the hat even though I am attracted to him?”

*If this is you or your partner, please look up responsive desire.*

Instead of defaulting to the idea that the lower libido partner should seek to increase their desire for sex or should have more sex without desire because their partner “needs” it, let’s instead help people remember what loving, pleasurable sex looks and feels like within the context of a romantic relationship:

- It feels safe to decline without repercussions.
- It is pleasurable for all involved.
- It is mutual.

There are times where “more sex” is OBVIOUSLY NOT the answer, and we need to continue calling those situations out. For example, if a woman has recently given birth or is breastfeeding and doesn’t want to have sex at all, that is a natural biological function. If her partner is trying to require her to have more sex in those circumstances *they are simply wrong.*

There are situations where couples would mutually like to have more sex, and that is wonderful! This can often be accomplished by partners intentionally exploring what feels good (especially beyond PIV), creating spaces free of stress where sex can be more pleasurable, and increasing non-sexual intimacy in order to increase sexual desire. Reddit often jumps to “get your hormones checked” in these cases — hormones absolutely might be playing a part, but don’t skip all the other steps.

No one is owed sex. Not if you’re in a relationship with them. Not if you’re married to them.

As for those who would argue “My partner won’t have sex with me, but when you’re married, your partner is the ONLY person you’re allowed to have sex with! I didn’t sign up to be celibate!” Here are my suggestions:

- if you want an orgasm, masturbate
- if you don’t feel wanted or desired, ask your partner for other expressions thereof
- ask your partner if sex is pleasurable for them
- determine whether this is a passing season (is someone more stressed than usual with a job or childcare? Has someone just had a baby or been sick?) if it is, **wait**
- go to a sex therapist
- divorce

 But don’t merely assume that your partner is Wrong, Conniving, Deceitful, or otherwise Bad for wanting sex less often than you.",1731547713.0,Justwannaread3,TwoXChromosomes
Married at 16 - Confessions of a Child Bride,"

I was told I should share this story here. I’m still married and I’m trying to deconstruct what is normal about my relationship and what isn’t, and someone said you all would be a great resource!

I got married at 16.

It’s the most uncomfortable fact about me, and people usually find out quickly after meeting me if I can’t manage to dodge their questions. It shapes how I’m perceived. It’s also a reminder of the trauma that surrounds it.

Being raised LDS (Mormon), I was heavily influenced by purity culture and chastity doctrine, so when I was sexually assaulted I felt like I had no other option but to marry the perpetrator.

My parents and the church all made me believe I was a broken vessel that no righteous man would ever want, all because I wasn’t a virgin anymore. My only worth as a woman was to be a wife to a righteous man. Not only was I brainwashed into believing I had to marry this man to be happy, but the church as an institution let it happen! Instead of bringing me to a lawyer to convict my abuser, they brought me to a judge to marry him.

The bishop was the officiant, and approved of me getting sealed before I was old enough to sign my own papers.

I felt so much shame for so long and blamed myself for this happening. I wouldn’t tell anyone the real reason I got married.

I’m just now getting the courage to speak up against this publicly, and I’m shocked at how many girls in the church have a similar story. 

If you have TikTok and want to hear my story I’d appreciate the support ❤️.

Or just search mamabaerr

After getting married I couldn’t go to the doctor without him, get a job without his consent (legally), or get a bank account. I was too young to divorce if I had wanted to. 

He didn’t allow me to be on birth control, and I had two kids against my will. I was put on fertility medication when I was barely 17. 

After my first baby, I got the IUD without my husband agreeing to it because I almost died during my pregnancy. At only 6 weeks post-partum, he told me if I didn’t get the IUD taken out the next day he would divorce me. I got it taken out and my doctor handed me a DV pamphlet. I wish someone told me this wasn’t normal.

All the adults around me let this happen.
The church let this happen.
The government let this happen. 
The doctors giving a minor fertility meds let this happen.

I’m trying to forgive myself for being too young to understand what I was getting myself into. I hope my story reaches someone who needs to know they’re not alone and that what they are taught isn’t okay. 

Even now, I don’t know what about my relationship is normal and what isn’t. My dad was a narcissist that tried to kill me and my mom, so next to him my husband felt like an angel sent to rescue me. 

I’m in therapy, individual and couples, to try to see if our relationship can become healthy. He’s grown a lot as a person and I’ve forgiven him for what happened in our early relationship. I feel like although he’s made progress, he doesn’t understand how deeply all of this affected me. Our dynamic has changed and I’ve been his caretaker as well as the provider for about six years. He got hit by a drunk driver, so ive been basically a single mom and too overwhelmed to think about deconstructing my relationship until now.

I hope my story helps someone, and I hope sharing helps people like me know they’re not alone! I also am terrified about the current political climate and how many more girls will be trapped in these marriages… I hope for a day where this isn’t so common.

My male therapist basically told me today that men aren’t capable of being thoughtful,"I went to see my psychologist today who I’ve been seeing him on and off since i was 14. Now, at 24, I see him once a year or so when I’m having a difficult time. Ive been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder in the past. The one theme in our sessions that seems to have remained consistent from a young age until now is my tendency to be very critical of myself and always think that somethings wrong with me. Most recently it’s come up in the context of a relationship, the first serious relationship i would say I’ve ever been in. I spoke to him about this tendency I have to read into subtle changes in my partners behaviour, assume that this thing I’m perceiving is the result of my partner no longer being attracted to me/not wanting to be with me, and then distancing myself from him and hoping that he’ll notice and give me reassurance (which I understand isn’t healthy. Hence why I made an appointment to address this). He provided a lot of useful perspective and I was ready to leave my appointment feeling positive and optimistic.

And then he said something- I don’t know how he intended it to come across. Maybe he was trying to be funny and lighthearted, but it stopped feeling that way as he went on and became infuriating. He told me “[my name], you are seriously overestimating the abilities that men have”. He said to me that men basically function like cavemen and only see things that are surface level and existing in the present moment. That men and women are fundamentally different in the way they think and behave; men being very direct and literal and having a tendency to want to fix things, and women having subtleties in their behaviour and tending to want someone to just listen, rather than solve their problems. He said that if my partner goes hours without answering a text of mine, in my mind I’m upset and assuming that he isn’t in love with me enough, whereas instead, he likely isn’t thinking about me at all, not because he doesn’t love me but because men are only concerned with their immediate surroundings. He gave this example of a woman hinting all week at wanting to go to her favourite restaurant for hers and her partners anniversary, and said that guys never notice this sort of thing; that they’re just bumbling around through life thinking about food and sleep and whatnot, and can only make sense of things that are direct. Then he went on to tell me that he has this criteria he made up for one of his wife’s friends who habitually dates shitty guys, where they only have to have/be 3 things: not physically abusive, not verbally abusive and have acceptable hygiene. Anything else is a bonus.

Am I wrong for having this seriously rub me the wrong way? I was genuinely in disbelief as he was saying this. His whole point felt so sexist and entirely weaponizing the incompetence that a lot of men have. I have no doubt that what he said is more or less the case for some men who are selfish and make shitty partners, but that isn’t the case for me. My partner and I communicate frequently throughout the day, he regularly tells me that he can’t stop thinking about me, that he misses me and can’t wait to see me. He listens to me when I have the courage to confide in him about something and offers nothing but loving words and support. He surprises me with acts that are super thoughtful and completely unexpected. It felt like he was excusing shitty men in relationships with women by saying that that’s just the way their brain works, and that women are going to be left disappointed if they expect anything otherwise. It annoyed me to no end, not only for all of the women that have had to endure relationships with men like this, but also for the men who do know how to be truly attentive to their partners needs and are being grouped into this generalization. None of what he said about men gave me a sense of relief or provided clarity. It actually made me question whether my partner is being sincere in the things he says or if he’s just doing it to appease me. It annoyed me that even a phd level educated man who is in a position to help me found a way to remove blame from men and make it women’s responsibility to dumb down their communication. This is someone who I’ve put so much trust in over the last 10 years, and I just left my appointment feeling gross. I seriously couldn’t believe it.",1705356907.0,otvoi,TwoXChromosomes
First healthy relationship - is this normal?,"Hi all!

So I (27F) wanted to get some advice. 
I’m in the beginning stages of what I believe to be the first healthy relationship I’ve ever been in. I’m taking things really slowly and just enjoying each stage of the process. 

My past relationships were either unhealthy because of them (how they behaved) or me (my unresolved core wounds and traumas). 
They were intense, full of love bombing, over promising, and void filling etc.  

For a long time I’ve been working on myself and finally feel self-love. I’m ok in myself, ok being alone, independent (instead of my usual co-dependency) and have finally started actually putting my needs first. It feels great and I am happy. 

I met a wonderful man (34M) 7 months ago. I just got back from visiting him for a week where he lives whilst he’s finishing his studies. It was a great trip, we had such a good time. 
We’re not officially together yet because I want to take it slowly (as opposed to my past lightening speed relationships). He understands and completely respects the pace I want to take. 

He truly is a wonderful person with a gentle, attentive, thoughtful, honest, kind, intentional, principled, integrous, warm, supportive, and sensitive character (I could go on and on with my list of his positive attributes haha). 

Anyway, my question is this:
* **is it normal that I feel ok without him?**

The reason I’m unsure if that’s normal is because I feel the following:
* If things didn’t work out, I’d be ok. 

In the past I was so anxious about romantic relationships. Really desired them because it represented someone caring about me etc. I didn’t feel ok with the idea of being alone.

* I don’t feel the need to text him all day/throughout. 

In the past, I would have wanted more frequent communication. Not hearing from a romantic partner would have made me a little worried they didn’t like me or something was wrong. 
We’re both busy people and so far, check in at the beginning and end of the day.
I feel confident about his feelings and intentions for me.

* I enjoy my personal/alone time

Yesterday when we were talking on the phone, I eventually told him I have to go (after maybe 45 mins-1 hour). The convo was good. I didn’t have to go because I had a particular task to do, I just wanted continue enjoying the me time I had before he called. 

* I don’t feel like I need him

We get along great. I enjoy his company. 
In the past, I needed that romantic partner in my life. To feel ok, to feel cared for etc. 

With the guy I’m dating now, I don’t feel like I need him, but I do want him, and that’s growing each day.

All of my exes who dumped me and married the next person eventually tried reaching out,"I have 5 exes who dumped me in the past, anywhere from 10 to 3 years ago. The relationships weren't even toxic. We had good communication, we're in decent financial positions. I'm a patient and non-controlling person. My family liked them and their family liked me. We traveled (my family owns a time share and let them stay there with me for vacation). We were intimate. I supported their goals. I balanced college and date nights so we had plenty of time together. I worked out to stay fit and cooked homemade meals for us. I never cheated. These relationships lasted a few years each. I was always shocked how none of them proposed considering I tried to be the best partner I could, and I had peers who were getting married left and right.

Then comes the breakups. One of them said his family was going through too much and it wasn't a good time to be in a relationship. Another ex cheated on me with his female friend and left me right after I found out. Another one left because he said he realized he's not interested in being married. Another left me for the girl he married. And another one said he lost attraction to me and couldn't figure out why. Every single one of them apparently married the next girl and eventually reached out to me out of nowhere to complain. They would complain about all sorts of things (i.e. dead bedroom, him and the wife always fighting, the wife cheated, no one in the household can cook and they're going broke from ordering takeout, their wife's baby daddy is driving them crazy [two of my married exes have stepkids], etc).

I ended up telling them it's not my problem and to talk to their wives, not me. Then blocked them. They still on rare occasion try to reach out another way but I continue blocking. I guess my question is, why do men do this? They're in a healthy stable long-term relationship, then leave for no good reason, get married to the next person rather fast, end up miserable and try to reach out to the ex. Why didn't they just get married when they were in that healthy, stable long-term relationship? This happened to my sister too by the way. She's very successful, smart, kind and down to earth. Her ex was with her almost 5 years without proposing then left. According to mutual friends he's now unhappy in a toxic marriage. He tried reaching out to her as well.

TL;DR Why do so many men leave a good relationship just to end up with a not so good one and have the gall to reach out to the ex who they left for no good reason?",1710100544.0,Childfree91,TwoXChromosomes
They accuse me of being a puppy killer: Why the foster care arguments don't work on prolifers,"This probably won't be a complete thought but it's something I've thought a lot about lately. 

I spent ten years working for an animal shelter with an annual intake of around 10,000 animals in a small US city. Local law required we spay and neuter all animals leaving our facility before adoption. If a dog, cat, or rabbit came in already pregnant we would perform a gravid spay which is the equivalent of an abortion. Mom gets fixed, babies don't survive the procedure. Most kittens and puppies aren't viable outside of the womb until around 5 days before birth. So anything before that? Gravid spay. No, mom wasn't sent to a foster home or given a spot in the nursery to finish up her pregnancy and give birth in peace. 

We had partner rescues that would try to divert animals from our care even though we had more resources, because they didn't want animals to get this procedure. They were prolife and wanted the puppies and kittens to be brought to term and then mom and the litter hopefully fixed. They would take in sick or injured dogs and risk them dying instead of bring them to us when we had an onsite clinic to avoid having a gravid spay. Sometimes we had to terminate volunteers, staff, or partner relationships over this procedure. I've been called a puppy murderer more times than I can count. 

But here's the thing. Every year in the US we still euthanize MILLIONS of healthy, loving animals for lack of space, money, and homes. Animals that wage their tails and jump up and down excitedly and look at you with hope like you are their best friend taking them for a walk on their way to be euthanized. And you know what is going to happen, sometimes up to a dozen times that day to a dozen different thinking, feeling, loving souls.  When someone adopts an animal and frees up a cage, it literally saves two lives, the animal you adopted and the one that gets to fill its spot. 

So for one living cat to come in with the potential to become 7 I have to find space and future homes for, when I already had 400-500 waiting every, single, day for a home and 400-500 at risk of being put to death if that home doesn't show fast enough, it's ludicrous to bring those kittens into the world. Because 7 cats have to be put down to make room for them and potentially 14 cats end up dead if the mom and her 6 kittens don't find homes. Some shelters don't have the capacity for nursing mothers or neonates because they are so vulnerable to disease so they automatically get put down upon intake. 

And prolifers throughout the years have argued, cried, begged, and pleaded with me to at least let the puppies and kittens have a chance at finding a home! Let them try! If they could end up dead either way at least let them be born and know love and maybe find a home!! Because they don't give two shits about the 7 I have to kill to make room for the ones they want born. And the ones that won't get a home if the kittens are successful.  No amount of showing them cage after cage and row after row of desperate pleading LIVING eyes sways them from their belief that those potential puppies and kittens matter. 

Reflecting on the Roe shituation in the last week, I don't think the foster care/adoption argument matters to them. They may say it does but I've seen it first hand that if I've got two leashes in my hand, mom on the left can get spayed or dog on the right can be put down, they want puppies. They can look dog on the right in the face and say ""sorry fluffy, I can't support abortion"" even though fluffy didn't do anything wrong and neither did mom. There is no bootstrapping argument to be made. No personal responsibility. No control over female dogs. And certainly, no prolife argument, because they don't care about the literal life that has to be taken for the potential life they want so bad. 

The only thing at the end of it all is an irrational, illogical attachment to preventing abortion.",1656722760.0,TheMapesHotel,TwoXChromosomes
"[Support] I was ""minorly"" assaulted by a friend-of-a-friend last month and now most of my social group has ostracized me for wanting to go to the police.","The guy is a creep. He makes a sport out of violating physical boundaries and making women extremely uncomfortable in public. He gets some kind of perverse entertainment out of knowing he has the power to make people squirm, and he thrives on the negative attention of the woman and the other people around him at social gatherings that watch in disgust. The bigger a reaction out of the woman, the more he targets her. This isn't even my biased speculation about him, he proudly explains what he is doing as he is doing it and his friends all confirm that he has always been like that, and ""that's just him."" They're surprised he hasn't been arrested yet but they keep him around. They have been friends with him since kindergarten and have been enabling his predatory behaviour for his entire adult life. I am very close friends with a couple of his friends, however luckily I don't see him very often, but I do get exposed to him at a mutually attended party once every six months or so.


Last year at a social gathering, I was sitting on a bar stool and he came up cringe-inducingly close to me to talk. I don't know him very well and even with my close friends I like to maintain a certain personal bubble. When I asked him to back up a little because I was uncomfortable with his proximity, he pushed my knees open and stepped right in between my legs, trapping me in the corner against the bar and wouldn't leave no matter how many times I asked or explained how horrendously uncomfortable I was. He only stopped and disappeared when my husband arrived at the venue (my husband is a corrections officer and twice his size).


I wasn't at a gathering with him again without my husband there until 5 weeks ago. He started out by giving his trademark uncomfortable, forced, locked-in-so-you're-stuck-and-can't-get-away-until-he's-done-making-you-squirm hugs to everyone, and after last year I was having none of it. I very firmly and very publicly told him ""Don't hug me."" ""Don't touch me."" ""You do not have consent to hug me."" and in response he chased me around the room, literally running after me like I was a fucking dog. Then when people started sitting down, I had my back turned to him for a moment and he snuck in beside me, locked his arms around me, and wouldn't let go. When I screamed and tried to struggle away, he locked his arms tighter around me, leaned his face on my shoulder, and started rubbing his face on me while cooing. The whole time I kept repeating, ""Let go of me"" ""This is not consensual"" ""I do not consent to this"" ""Stop touching me"" but he wouldn't let go until he was good and done and everyone had stopped what they were doing to see what the fuck was happening. After that, I tried to keep my distance from him, but the instant that I let my guard down he would sneak behind me and caress a different extremely intimate-but-non-sexual place on my body while he was passing. Places like the small of my back down to just-not-quite-my-butt, the inside of my tricep riiiiight up adjacent to my breast, playing with my hair, whispering in my ear, caressing down my neck, caressing my face. . . but always stealthily sneaking up on me in passing and always reaching to grab the opposite side from where he was heading so I couldn't see it coming and couldn't physically stop him or shove him away because he was already gone again. Every time he did this I screamed, I yelled ""stop touching me"" ""don't touch me"" ""seriously I need you to stop touching me"" ""you do not have consent to touch me"" but the more people that saw it the more of a game it became to him because he loved that he was getting viewed by not just our group of friends but by the whole cafe. One close friend of mine tried to stand up for me and explain that I take boundaries really seriously and he couldn't keep doing this, and he responded by locking eyes with her for ten creepy seconds while reaching in and fondling her hair (This btw was the first day they had ever met and her boyfriend was right beside her). Through the whole day no one else tried to help me, they just commented that ""geez he's being extra creepy today"" and that ""this was getting a little uncomfortable to watch"" but ""that's just him! If you just react less, he'll eventually get bored!"" At the end of the day people instead of questioning him for being creepy started questioning me for be so sensitive and over-reacting, and I tried to explain to everyone (the creep included) that the places he was touching, while non-sexual, were parts of my body that only my husband had touched in the past five years since we met, and they are only for people I am intimately comfortable with, ie just my husband. Literally as I was explaining this, the fucker snuck behind me and caressed the small of my back again and whispered ""so you think he'd be mad about this?"" and ran away. Found out afterwards that not only was he getting a kick out of my extremely sensitive reactions, he was getting a kick out of knowing that he was doing this specifically to a law enforcement officer's wife like it was an extra fuck you to the law and fuck you to the guy who should be the most equipped to protect me. WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.


So I want to press charges. He wanted to fuck with the law?! I am well within my right to have the law FUCK HIM RIGHT BACK. Not only was the experience itself horrible, it triggered PTSD flashbacks for me from when I was raped as a teenager. I worked my ass off in therapy for years to psychologically recover and heal and regain my sense of safety, autonomy, and be able to have healthy relationships again after my past trauma, and I had finally reached a point where I had worked through 99% of my triggers and I wasn't having nightmares or flashbacks anymore. . . I had been psychologically free of that rape for 6 long, wonderful years. Then this fucker comes along and BOOM. Turns out having my autonomy over my own body violated again is a pretty serious trigger for me in the last 1% that of my rape that I hadn't worked through because NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DESENSITIZE THEMSELVES TO BEING VIOLATED.


So I'm angry. I'm feeling violated. The thought of him makes my skin crawl and my chest tighten. I feel powerless and anxious and unsafe. I'm breaking down on a regular basis and my husband has held me while I cried myself to sleep at least once a week since it happened. I'm hurt and disgusted and mad that this creep's fucking ""games"" of assault have undone years of freedom from PTSD. My husband wanted me to contact the police immediately, but respected that whatever we did would be my decision and that it was complicated for me because that creep is the oldest friend of one of my closest friends. Originally I wanted to have an intervention with him, and explain that what he was doing was a crime (because he seemed to think that he is scot free since he never actually grazed my butt or breasts), and that if he doesn't take this seriously and stop that I would press charges. But then his best friend disclosed to me that it wouldn't do anything, you can't get through to the creep because he's just a bad guy. And I kept getting more and more affected by what happened. I realized that I don't give a fuck about giving him a chance or resolving it however would be best for everyone in the social group, because I want to resolve it best for ME. I guess they all expected that I would just drop it because ""c'mon it was so minor"", and maybe not show up to parties with him at it. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, until last night I got triggered again and finally resolved to go to the police. I just wanted to let my friends know first, because the police would be trying to contact them for witness statements and I wanted them to hear it from me first and explain fully why this all hurt me so much. Why, while ANY woman should just be respected as a default, this is been particularly damaging to me because of my past.


A few were supportive, shocked to hear what I had previously been through (because I had recovered so strong they never would have thought I was a rape survivor), and so so sorry that he was such a creep and that I had already been through so much. These were the few that had been ready to ditch this guy socially for a long time but just hadn't had enough of a push. The rest now fucking hate my guts. I was accused of being ""unreasonable"" and ""disrespectful"" and ""careless with other people's lives"" and they couldn't condone ""ruining someone's life over this"" by pressing charges when ""it is so minor"" and ""he was just joking."" They would ""have none of it"" and ""be no part it"" saying ""don't you dare contact me for a witness report."" These were men and women saying this btw. Formerly close friends telling me ""how could you do this?"" and ""you haven't even asked for an apology!"" and ""this doesn't make anything right! it just ruins a friend's life unnecessarily!"" and ""this isn't some stranger, this is a friend!"" ""how can you be so reckless with someone's LIFE?""


I wish I was shocked. But I'm not. People who keep someone like him around for so long condoning that disgusting behaviour from the sidelines don't take the victim's side. But facing that reality, I am still so hurt. They were some of my closest friends. But they value his friendship and well-being over my bodily autonomy, and now they are attacking me just for wanting to report him. In their eyes he's the victim and I'm the monster. So after everything he did to me, and to so many other women over the years, I'm the one that loses most of my friends while they rally around him for support.


I could really use some support of my own and my sister suggested I come here. Thank you if you managed to read all the way to the end.",1524636570.0,throw-it-all-away1,TwoXChromosomes
Had the most consensual experience of my life and I'm in shock,"This is just a rant basically.

When I was 15, I went on my first date. He treated me like absolute crap. Walked ahead of me the whole time, then sexually assaulted me in the back of his car. This has impacted me so much that I view sex not as something fun or something to be done out of love, but something that would be done to hurt me. I've always avoided it.

I'm in my early 20s and never had penetrative sex. With other guys I've dated, there was never really anything to ask on their part. They'd just grab whatever they wanted to without asking. I got so used to this behavior and it was so normal to me. I treated every outing with a partner as a nerve-wracking event because I didn't know when they'd touch me, where, or what else they'd do.

I'm in university now and I recently met this guy that I click with really well. I'm not the type to go for even kissing early on, but I kissed him the second time we hung out. I went back to his apartment a few days ago and left in absolute shock. We started making out and he'd pause and look at me for consent before touching me anywhere new. If I didn't say yes, he'd move on without another thought and there was no sulking. I didn't know people like this existed. I just wanted to make out and hang out with him and that's exactly what we did without him making me feel uncomfortable -- ever. He seriously didn't get mad at me or pressure me when I said no to something. He didn't make me feel weird and lame. I told him we'd slowly build over time. He joked about round 2 and I asked what happens in round 2. He looked at me with the most genuine, innocent look and said whatever I wanted. This guy didn't even pin my arms down until I told him I thought it was hot and he asked to make sure I was okay a few times. He made sure to compliment my body in the sweetest way when my top came off. He did touch around and honestly, a lot more than I did to him. He was so focused on my pleasure and I've never had that before. After we were done, we giggled at funny stories, cuddled, and went to sleep.

I know people reading this are probably thinking uh duh, that's what it's supposed to be like, but I never knew. I've been terrified of sex my whole life and now I'm very open to going all the way with him after a few more ""rounds"" as he called it. Men that have claimed to love me in the past pressured and guilt tripped me into going down on them or letting them touch whatever they wanted. They'd threaten to never see me again, sulk, get angry, and/or treat me like I was some freak.

This man has made me feel more comfortable with both sex and my body than anyone ever has. From the bottom of my heart, I wish this level of comfort for everyone out there.

edit: this post is new, but thank you so much for the nice comments and the support. This is a sensitive topic for me and it really means a lot. I also love reading about the healthy relationships you guys have :)

edit2: am I allowed to even do this twice?? anyway, I'm overwhelmed with love. I'm so incredibly thankful for all of the sweet comments. I've been reading every single one and the support makes me want to cry. I'm so sorry to those who are able to relate to the bad parts of my post. No one deserves that. To the people calling him a keeper, you're probably right. I'm planning on saving this post and I'll show it to him if we become official down the line. We talk for hours and hours before anything physical happens. I got some snacks that he mentioned he likes and we'll hang out again soon :) I absolutely will tell him that his level of respect and the comfort that he brought was amazing and I appreciate it. He's just the kindest person, so you're all right and I think he will appreciate it. Again, I wish everyone all the best and all the love in the world!",1644727074.0,BlockLatter,TwoXChromosomes
My husband dismissed my whole career,"This is a rant and while I am upset with my husband, I do not need advice on divorcing him. He is a fantastic, supportive person and we very rarely differ in our opinions. I am excited to be building a family with him. 

Context: I am an outpatient therapist and my husband currently has a family member suffering from drug withdrawal induced psychosis. I don't deal with this issue every day, but I have significant resources in our area that can help with this issue. 

There's two parts to this but they are related. 

First part is, that my husband does not believe that therapy would work for him. He has a long mental health history, but has developed relatively healthy coping skills, compared to his family member. Both our jobs provide an EAP, which is several sessions of free talk therapy either locally or over BetterHelp. There have been numerous ups and downs over our relationship due to this family member, which has caused my husband significant distress. I have tried to get him to go to therapy before but the only thing he has done was get on meds, which he is not currently on, but they did help him. 

Over the weekend, the family member was not doing well again, and it had really started to take a toll on my husband. I took care of him and provided him space to process if he wanted to. I have not had fantastic interactions with this family member in the past, and as I am currently pregnant, I am acutely aware that I am in more danger than previously. I have also been stressed about the situation and my husband was worried about stressing me out, so I told my husband one morning that I think it would be helpful for him to at least go to one therapy session to process. My husband told me he ""doesn't think it would work and why would talking to someone else who doesn't know the situation help?"" 

That one hurt. But I brushed it off as I had kind of expected that response. 

The second part, is that this family member is currently delusional and suffering from hallucinations after sobering up. The delusions are not something new, but it has been relayed to me that this is the worst it has ever been. The delusions often focus on the nuclear family and myself, with the theme of ""we are out to get them"". Due to the nature of my work and the amount of stress I have been under, I decided to staff the ""case"" with my supervisor. She provided more resources on top of what I already knew of. Since I have not been directly involved by my husband's parents in the situation, I started sending my husband those resources. 

When I got home that night, I asked my husband if he had sent the resources to his family that are taking care of the family member. He did not as he assumed I would send them. While they are my in-laws, I am aware that I was intentionally not made aware of the situation by my husband's family, so it felt inappropriate to send them resources on a situation that I'm probably not supposed to know about. My husband asked me to explain the resources and then proceeded to say ""well those wouldn't be helpful anyways. You don't know the context of this situation and we don't want to break the trust of the family member."" 

That broke me. I understand that it is hard to get someone suffering from psychosis to voluntarily go to treatment. I understand that not every resource will be helpful. I took time out of my busy day to find resources for my family, to help support them, and my husband dismissed all of that. 

I understand the context of the situation perfectly well. I have clients all the time in that context with their family member or sometimes even themselves. 

For my husband to just dismiss my entire career in a couple sentences, has changed my perspective on him completely. How can someone know what I do for a living, and say that none of it relates to him or his family? How can he stand there and say those things when I have helped him with his own mental health issues? 

I recognize why therapists aren't supposed to do therapy with their friends and family. It is just so frustrating to hear those words from someone whom I confide in and open up to. I feel completely invalidated and honestly, useless.

I'm tired of the mental load (male 'incompetence'),"My fiance (m27) is an incredibly sweet man: he's kind and gentle and soft-spoken. He is affectionate, laughs in the face of traditional gender roles and is overwhelmingly a gem to be around.

However, he's a perfect example of how men don't think about the mental load.

If I tell him to wash the dishes, he's happy to help! But he'll do just that: the handful of dishes in the sink get done, but the full-to-the-brim dishwasher stays full, he doesn't even check. 🙄 If I tell him to put away the food after I've cooked, he'll put away what's within plain sight and leave food in the oven. 

He crows with pride about cleaning the kitchen for me after I cook dinner, but I walk into the kitchen and the stove has remnants of dinner cooking: spots and spatters here and there, the butter for the bread lays on the table and the sink is full of food bits from the plates being rinsed off. 

If I ask him to unload the dishwasher, he asks me where XYZ item goes. We've lived here for a while now. Nothing has moved. But still he asks me constantly where the simplest of dishes go.

He wonders why I often tell him ""I'll just do it."" And it upsets him because it sounds awful, but I don't want his help if I only get half-assed help.

He came up to me the other day and said ""We're out of forks."" I know we have approximately 30 forks of various sizes and they didn't evaporate into the ether. So I ask him if he's checked the dishwasher.

He didn't even think about it.

I am so incredibly tired, please forgive my rant. Anyone else having similar problems? I wind up feeling like such a nag.

Edit: This is just me venting into the void and hoping someone else can relate haha. Yes, we've talked about it at length, repeatedly. It still happens and I've come to accept it as part of him. This is a minor issue in the grander scheme of thing imo. He's a great man who only sometimes makes me want to slam my skull into a wall lmao.

I DO NOT believe he does it on purpose!

Edit #2: I've gotten some comments who point out this is an ADHD thing, not just a man thing. Yes, I am aware that my fiance having ADHD means he thinks differently then I do. That's okay, and I make efforts to accommodate that because I love him and don't want to be ableist. Detailed lists, gentle reminders and the like. Hell I'm planning on putting labels on each cabinet!

Edit 2.5: The reason I am posting about this on this sub is this: I have been with partners with and without ADHD, regardless of gender and whilst having BPD and ADHD myself. /*ALMOST*/. Every. Single. Man. In my life has been like this when it comes to the mental load. I KNOW not ALL men do this, ENOUGH men do this for it to be a subject here. I have disorders that cause me difficulty functioning but I am still expected to handle it bc I have a vagina. I don't understand why on a women's subreddit I still have to have a disclaimer of ""not all men"", but here you go.

Edit 3: Some of yall getting really pissed bc of a simple vent so let me explain, again. I left this out bc I didn't want people thinking I was trolling for sympathy. My mother died less then 3wks ago, which is the whole reason we moved in with my father. I'm emotional and just wanted to vent a common problem I've had in a multitude of relationships with men, that is putting pressure on me. Normally it's not the world's biggest deal if the man forgets how forks work. It's been a minor problem up until now. 

90% of the time he's a perfect man. I love him and aren't going to nuke a healthy, positive relationship over a minor problem. 

Also, these edits ARE NOT for the kind souls offering gentle solutions and trying to help legitimately! I love you all and please keep them coming. I'm talking about the people who think I'm a sexist or a bitchy woman just bc I'm frustrated and wanted to vent. I'm aware this post comes off bluntly, it's not my intent to make my fiance sound like an awful man or diminish the fact that he has adhd and is trying to help.",1633436119.0,TheLovelyKatarine,TwoXChromosomes
"He likes the idea of women, but he doesn’t actually like women","After 4.5yrs of dating my partner, I decided to dump him.

Now the relationship never felt or seemed abusive but eventually fell into a rhythm where I was always stepping on eggshells.

Here are some of the red flags that helped make my decision.

- complete refusal to engage in any of my hobbies. All local, all community or nature based and all fairly adjacent to his hobbies
- refusal to come to my family events, despite it being local
- I had an embargo on my top favourite topics and especially my work because I was ‘too emotional’ and ‘too irrational’
- the sex was him first and suggestion for me to do if I remembered to charge my vibrator. Had to be guilt tripped into going down on me and had no interest in providing any sexual pleasure for me.
- financially incapable of saving money and being financially dependent on his sister despite having a decent job.
- refusal to offer me the same drink, tea or item that he got up for despite me always doing this. This would also be the case for supermarkets too. Wouldn’t text me ‘hey I’m at the supermarket, lemmeee know if you need something’.
- felt ashamed of me when I was around him socially
- refused to take my advice despite my specific experience in areas of his life
- never planned to do anything together unless it was within his set of hobbies and experiences
- bought me items that helped me but it was only items so I wouldn’t use his items despite the fact that we could easily share.
- wouldn’t share anything. Not clothing. Not coat hangers. Not food. You name it… it was like fighting a rabid dog for some of his food.
- diet shaming was a regular. I ate too much processed sugar according to all the YouTube university he consumed. He shamed me and shamed fat people all the time. Apparently his diet was supreme and the reason why he is so healthy.
- period shaming. He didn’t really want to hear about it, despite the fact that I had an IUD and I didn’t really get one
- I began to refuse to shave my legs and I got a bad haircut that made me flag as more bisexual. He complained that I wasn’t puting in effort to make myself attractive to him.
- he refused to put the toilet seat down, tuck his shoes away at the door or open the window after a stinky shit.
- he would never come on errands with me just to help me, despite the fact that I would be getting things for him
- would have meltdowns if I forgot anything, despite my diagnosed lack of memory and specifically asking to remind me. He’d claim I was a liar even though I’d forget. Apparently deliberately lying and being a forgetful adhder was the same as lying.
- refused to come house sit with me despite getting lovely locations that were of interest to him. He just needed to take an antihistamine.
- when I would occasionally snore he would physically flip me to the other side as if I was a judo competitor. If he snored, which he did for most of our relationship, I would bump him and quietly ‘baby roll over please, thank youuu’
- would bully me that my bisexuality wasn’t legitimate because I haven’t had a gf before.
- I started getting a bit jealous of the amount of affection he showed his cat compared to me.
- refused to show affection claiming it’s not within his culture - even in private. Giving him a hug or kiss in private felt against his will. I am an affectionate person. He would only kiss me when he wanted sex. lol.
- would make sexist, rape, harassment, disability jokes. Despite my direct connection to them.
- would bully me that my mobile gaming was REAL gaming despite me finishing the whole pay to play mobile game and being one of the only reported people to have done it.
- hated when I did duolingo. I have a 323 day streak and discouraged me from doing a language class at home.
- had to be guilt tripped into saying nice things about me. When I felt like I improved on even the smallest thing, if he didn’t think it was that good, he would claim that it wasn’t that good and I was a baby for asking for encouragement.
- would refer to me with a pet nickname that described my body. I didn’t like it, but he convinced me to use it. Used his cultural background to justify it despite me saying no to it.
- was travelling to a country for a home stay holiday at a friend’s place. This country will bankrupt you with any medical or rescue bill. I looked into insurance and was going to buy it for him because he wasn’t ’a weak stupid baby that needed travel insurance. Because he’s travelled all over the world and never needed it’… except he’s never gone to the country. Oh but I have. 3 times and recently for 4months. I wouldn’t know anything about it. Hahahahah
- was making me pay more than my fair share of rent despite me never being home. I wasn’t using some areas of our home as they were dedicated for him. I wasn’t really allowed friends over or allowed more than a couple of cupboards of space. He had 4x as much storage. He claimed that I could keep my stuff at my parents.
- he Was going to start making me pay 50% bills despite him WFH and me never being at home and never using AC or other power intensive things.
- when I wanted to watch a shitty tv show, he would make a HUGEEE cry about how it was the worst thing he’s ever watched and I should be ashamed of how bad it was and I liked it. I never really watched tv shows I would actually like. Additionally he would watch really psychologically disturbing stuff before bed despite my consistent request not to because I struggled to go to sleep. He’d call me a baby and complain about all my shit tv shows. When I went into my room to watch my shows, he would complain that I don’t want to spend time with him.
- said that I am a very anxious person like my mum and that I was better when we first started dating and now I had turned into an anxious wreck hahahahahaha I WONDER WHY
- regularly would tell me I need to accept that I am a looser and that I am pathetic and to get better and be an adult and not a baby.
- would often refuse to help me do things like carry heavy or awkward items.


He likes the idea of a woman but he doesn’t actually like me as a woman - a human female.



**Edit/Q&A:**

Q: How did you stay with him for so long, even after seeing all those red flags?

A: Gaslighting and past experiences with hyper-abusive relationships contributed to it. It didn't start getting really bad until the last two years, and I was overseas travelling by myself for six months during that time. By the time I came back, I was in a weird living arrangement and was in denial. I had to figure it out and get stable. It was somethhing I was thinking about since January.


Q: What made you finally decide to leave him?

A: It was a combination of my strong mostly female/queer, mostly single, mostly childfree friends and joining a community group that reminded me what being loved feels like. I started realising that I was going to dump him through fantasies of being single that I could actually be happier without him. Plus, reading studies about how single, child-free women are the happiest sealed the deal for me.


Q: Was there a moment when you realised he didn't actually love you?

A: Absolutely. It became clear that he didn’t love me, just the benefits of having me around. He liked me when I was mirroring him or doing things for him. When I started showing the real me, he couldn’t handle it.


Q: What was the final straw?

A: Honestly, his respect for my boundaries eroded over time. When I realised that he gave more affection to his cat than to me, it hit me hard. That, and the fact that I couldn’t be myself around him anymore. The closer I got to unmasking my true self, the more he withdrew.


Q: Do you think he’ll date someone else soon?

A: I doubt it. He’s not in a good place emotionally, and I don’t think he’ll be in a relationship anytime soon.


Q: What are you moving on to?

A: I like my job, I am investing into my community and friendships, and I just bought a home by myself. I can't wait for the house warming! PS He refused to come to viewings except for 2 that I guilt tripped him into. Apparrently BUYING A HOME IS NOT HIS INTEREST AND HE DOESNT WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. Secretly he was too financially loose with his money to consider buying a place with me.

Ultimately, I am already enjoying the peace.


Q: What do your friends think about it?

I’d really just like some kind words from some other women after a crappy experience ,"First of all I’m really proud of my body and I think it’s beautiful. 

In the last year and a half I’ve managed to lose around 20kg and am at a comfortable 76kg now. It was done through diet because I’m not an athletic person. In fact, I loathe exercise. Despite that, I was able to reach my goal weight which I’m really proud of. 

A few weeks ago I began dating this guy. We matched on an app and he seemed sweet. We had lots of similar interests and a similar dating history: Me only having had a brief romantic relationship and him having had none. I honestly thought we were a great match. 

We quickly developed really great chemistry and had fun together on easy-going dates with lots of banter between us. 

We had date number 3 yesterday. At one point I brought up deal breakers. He said his only one was cheating. 

Well, I found out a few hours later that apparently my weight was another one. 

He’s a heavy gym-goer. I told him on the first date that that’s not my thing. At that time he started to ask if I’d tried other kinds of gym equipment, but I told him exercise in general just isn’t enjoyable for me. I thought that was the end of it. 

Well towards the end of THIS date (at his place btw) he said that we should ‘get you using the weights to make you healthier and build an ass’. 

I awkwardly chuckled and said, no that’s not really something I’m interested in. Mind you, he has no idea about my level of health. At no point did we ever discuss anything related to ‘healthiness’ or engage in any activities that would make him think I’m unhealthy. So I’ve been around the block long enough to know what ‘healthy’ is really code for.

Note though that I’m now an Australian size 14 (US 10), which is the average women’s size.

But I asked him if he was attracted to me. He said he needs to think of a good way to answer this and stayed silent for a solid minute, before finally saying that I’m not his usual type but I’m ‘pretty’. When I asked him to clarify his ‘usual type’ he said, “I usually like women who are a bit skinnier”.

Note that I was his first ever date, first ever kiss, and first ever woman he had seen topless. So it’s not like he’s comparing me to his exes. 

He said that my body now is ‘ok’ but he wouldn’t like it if I got any bigger. 

I was noticeably upset. I explained to him that weight is a very complicated issue for women and it can fluctuate. It’s not always as simple as diet and exercise and it’s possible I could become bigger. 

He didn’t have anything to say to that. 

So I asked him if he actually liked me or if he was just trying to lose his virginity. He’s in his early 30s so I suspect that this was more about him trying to ‘meet a life milestone’ rather than actually develop a relationship. And I told him my suspicion. 

He denied that that’s what this was, but couldn’t tell me any detailed examples of what he liked about me. I asked him if he had managed to match with girls who were more ‘physical type’ would we even be here right now. 

He said he wasn’t sure. 

There was a lot of in between, but eventually I asked, “if a few months from now we’ve had sex and you’ve had those experiences, would you still want to continue dating me?”

And I kid you not, this asshole literally stopped, stared off into space and thought about it for a good ten seconds before answering, “yeah…? yeah, I think so.”

Well that was answer enough. I left and that was that. 

Look I know that a curvy body isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. And that’s fine. But why get 3 dates in and tell a woman that she needs to lose weight (and certainly not gain weight) to be attractive to you? If not having a gym body is a dealbreaker, say so, or better yet, don’t match with someone you’re not attracted to to begin with.

I feel used. 

I feel angry that what I thought was a genuine connection, was really just some guy looking to sleep with the first woman he could find, even if she wasn’t attractive to him.

 But mostly I feel like I’m never going to find someone to love me. 


EDIT: wow you guys are honestly so amazing. Thank you so much for all of the kind words, support and overall joyfulness from you all. I absolutely feel so much better and love all that from this crappy experience I was able to receive so much positivity. 
I wish I’d said some of the wonderful things you guys had commented in the moment!

I was 14 when I got pregnant.,"I was 14 when I got pregnant and had my daughter. I was scared and hid my pregnancy from everyone and wore very big coats until the day of labor. I begged my boyfriend at the time to be the one to tell my mother. He said, ""You're not pregnant, just fat"". I wanted to believe it so bad even with the kicking and aches and 2 positive tests. 


It was Friday when I started having contractions. After a few days I couldn't bear the pain anymore. I told my mom and she cried. I was rushed to the hospital where the nurses made their snide comments and I tried so hard to be invisible, which is hard when everyone is shocked at the 14 year old in labor. The anesthesiologist said ""It's such a shame"" while I'm hunched over getting the epidural.  I had my daughter Monday night while Sponge bob played in the back. 


She was born healthy, long, and had an obsession with chewing on her fists. A social worker came to talk to me while I was in the hospital asking if the sex was consensual and some other questions. My mom and family friend bought the items I needed for her and I had a very awkward baby shower a few weeks after my daughter was born. 


I was 15 with a year old daughter and a boyfriend who ""hated babysitting"" his own daughter while I went to school. My mom told me not to tell anyone at my school I had a daughter until I showed I got good grades so people couldn't say anything about me being a lazy teen mother. I get good grades but I'm not so hot at chemistry, my only bad class. My counselor calls me in every 2/3 weeks to ask if I'm pregnant again, what I'm doing at home to prevent becoming pregnant, wouldn't it have been better to give her up for adoption, etc. She's very rude and condescending. My then boyfriend goes to visit his family in another state and falls for some chick in his neighborhood and informs me he's not coming back. I'm now a single mother crying in the shower with no friends and wishing I was dead. 


I was 17 and in a different school and I have friends and lost a lot of weight. I'm still under a lot of stress and end up having a breakdown while in the middle of class. I went to a psychiatrist and got pills. I have depression and anxiety. The pills made me sleepy and hazy so I stop. A few months later I meet my current boyfriend who is also to be my prom date. My daughter is healthy, happy, and extremely smart. I work with her every day on reading, writing her name, ABC mouse, and math. 


I'm 21 now with a 6 year old daughter. I have a healthy and happy relationship of almost 4 years with my current boyfriend who is also my best friend. One of my friends is a 55 year old pastor and she has been a true blessing. She helped me realize that a lot of why I felt buried alive.  Because I was, and part of it because of me. I was in a ditch letting people throw dirt on me, and soon enough I was buried alive. It took some time and a lot of self reflection but I feel so much better. I still get depressed, but it's different. My depression has become in some way a friend I'm drifting apart from. It's weird and sad in a way to feel myself progressing to a new phase of life and new mentality. I don't think I'll ever not feel some depression, but I definitely don't feel like I'm drowning anymore. I feel blessed, I appreciate the people who are in my life, and I am so lucky to be a mother and how I've grown. I don't know if things happen for a reason, but because things happen there are reasons to be found, learned, and appreciated. 



I just needed to get this all out. Thanks for reading if you did.

Falling out of love in a healthy substantial relationship...why?,"I'm 24 and have been in a relationship with this guy for 2 years now. He is my first whole hearted love. He has been my best friend and the only person to really understand me so much for the longest time in my life. He has been nothing but supportive and loving and caring, as have I to him. We have been through some downs, both battling with depression sometimes, and just the common transition of life events like graduating college and what comes next etc. We have talked about moving in together and he has mentioned marriage in the far future. All of this sounds wonderful, but lately I have been feeling like dull. I don't know, I don't understand how I can be falling out of love with someone that has only shown me how great a person and a relationship can be. If that is the case then what is preventing this from happening to every future relationship? Is every love at risk for fading? When he hugs me tight and tells me how much he loves me I don't feel anything. But guilt in myself. Cuddling in bed the other night I couldn't keep tears from forming in my eyes when I stared at him because I knew I wasn't ""in love"" but I told him they were tears of joy. No I am not depressed, I have been very stable for some time now. I take antidepressants. I am on a very positive life course right now and am excited to apply to graduate school next fall as the next step. Can someone please help me with these feelings? Any advice? Thank you.

EDIT: I think deep down I think that maybe he isn't forever, but then as I type that out I think maybe in time? Like maybe ours is a long story, one of reconnection when 'settling' down? If he could he would marry me tomorrow. He is very sensitive and more emotive than I am, and he has told me before how he doesn't want to make me feel rushed about doing anything. I know the only thing I have to do now is talk to him, which I will. I think I just need some independence right now to figure things out. Thank you so much for all the advice and personal life advice too. It helps a lot. Also about the medication, I've been on antidepressants for like 5 years and I have recently changed prescription around 6 months ago, and I know my body and I know when I am depressed, so it isn't that but thank you for the concern. I'm just confused about love. Thank you all.

EDIT 2: I know that love is beyond excitement and 'butterflies'. I'm not looking to bounce to a new fresh 'exciting' relationship. I love and care about my partner more than any person I know and would do anything for him. I feel completely selfless when caring about him. I guess this is just a lull and a change of scenery or some sort of day trip could help. I guess I'm just confused about what being 'in love' really is anymore. When does caring, giving, and loving a person become just stale, but the mutual love is still there? It sounds like I'm describing a long term married couple which scares me, like it's been 2 years. I know if we were to go out to somewhere new or something we would spark again. I don't know. I guess I'm in a transition phase in my life right now, no real job right now but taking classes as prereqs, and maybe I'm projecting my boredom of my life onto my relationship. Either way, thank you all for commenting and just listening. It's all I really wanted",1451848115.0,spacewater,TwoXChromosomes
"If you are afraid to say no to your partner, you are not in a healthy relationship.","In healthy relationships, you can safely have a disagreement. There is no fear of retaliation, or screaming, or silent treatment. You are in charge of yourself and your life. Telling your partner no shouldn’t cause anxiety or fear. 

If you find yourself afraid to go against your partners wants — you are not in a normal relationship. Fear is not normal. Fearing someones reaction over simple things, is not normal.

“No, I’m going out with friends, but ill see you in a couple hours!”

“No, I’m going with the red shirt”

“No, I’m not in the mood”

“No, I can’t help with that, sorry!”

If you cannot safely say no, your relationship is not safe. Healthy relationships have arguments and frustrations— but they are easy to work out, don’t last for days, and you don’t feel afraid your partner will punish you for it. 

I’ve been there. Its hard to love someone who makes you feel that way. Love should feel safe. Saying no should be easy. I’m sorry for anyone struggling with this. You deserve to control your own life and to have your relationship support what you want.",1701624673.0,Demonbabiess,TwoXChromosomes
My fiancee of 4 years was raped and her personality completely changed. Should I postpone the wedding?,"**[Update here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3o3eo1/update_my_fiancee_of_4_years_was_raped_and_her/)**

I wrote the below post for r/relationships, but it was removed because it deals with rape (trigger warning!). The other subreddits that I could turn to are barely active and largely don't deal with my concerns (/r/rape, /r/rapecounseling, and /r/secondary_survivors included). I am 31 and my fiancee is 28.

Your advice is most appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------------
On New Year's Eve, I (Matt) got a call from a local hospital that my fiancee, Katie, needed me to come pick her up. When I arrived, two of her friends met me (they were pregaming together) and informed me that they had gone to a bar before the party at my house. Long story short, Katie saw her sloppy-drunk coworker (Brendan) who pulled her into a bathroom stall and raped her until the bar's security intervened and called the hospital. She had bruises all over her thighs and torso, a concussion from where she hit her head in the bathroom, serious tears to her vagina, and, most sickeningly, so much damage to her anus that she had awful fissures that would crack open when she had a bowel movement. 

**Before I continue: If you're going to start any comment with the idea that she's lying about being raped, please go elsewhere. That is NOT the purpose of this post.**

I've worked with her and the police to put this guy in jail. It has been almost a year with confirmed DNA, a host of evidence, and witnesses, but the court has been slow to move to trial. All the while, Brendan is a free man. Katie quit her job to get away from him, which has been difficult because she used to love her job and work. Now she rarely gets excited.

In fact, Katie has changed pretty dramatically. She used to love going out with friends, competing on her trivia team, happy hours, cooking, and spending quality one-on-one time with me. 

As of now, 10 months later, she's gone to lunch with a friend maybe once every two weeks. Other than that, she's alone or with me (she's freelancing from home). She doesn't drink anymore but also doesn't exercise (she's gained about 40lbs). When we spend time together, she doesn't seem interested in any kind of conversation--she just wants to do work or watch TV. That's it. 

Before January, Katie had never had therapy before. She now goes to counseling once a week for PTSD treatment and *takes around 8 pills a day* (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and sleep aids). 

While she is still great in bed, we rarely sleep together (we do sleep next to each other every night). 

The truth is that I'm not unhappy, I just don't know how to help her. I get glimpses of who she was before Brendan attacked her, and my heart still melts. I know that we're supposed to be together, through sickness and through health, but I wonder how I can get her smiling again.

What's worse, I suppose, is that we're supposed to get married in May 2016. We (Katie, her psychologist, and me) have worked very hard to reduce her stress levels, and we've had some big wins (no more night terrors and far fewer crying spells). When Katie talks about the wedding, it seems like she sees it as a far-off dream, not something that is going to happen in seven months. We haven't booked our location, planned our honeymoon, or even finalized our guest list. (I proposed to her in May 2013 so we figured we'd have lots of time. Not so.)

I don't want to add any stress to Katie's troubled psychological state, but we also *need* to start planning the wedding as soon as possible. Even the idea of bringing it up causes me anxiety because I worry about causing her to backslide.

Part of me wants to shake her and say ""you have to wake up sometime!"", but I know that wouldn't be effective.

So I'd like help in a few ways. Have any of you dated a girl who has gotten PTSD from violent rape? How did you cope and how did it change over time? Or for the ladies, what's the best advice I need to hear? And obviously I'd also like help figuring out what to do with the wedding. She was so excited... I get such a sinking feeling about addressing any of this with her.

Advice appreciated.
   
**tl;dr**: Fiancee has serious PTSD from violent rape. How do I bring up the wedding we're supposed to have in 7 months?

**Edit 1**: Thanks for all the replies thus far. Advice seems generally all over the place. The two things I want to clarify is that I've talked to her therapist about this issue and she gave no clear direction. The second thing is that I have no intention of leaving her. While I appreciate the comments concerned about my well-being and happiness in this relationship, I am in therapy myself (you *can't* help someone through this if you're not healthy yourself) and know that even with all the bad weighing on Katie right now, she and I are still meant to be together as husband and wife, period.

I was in a relationship with a narcissist and I’m sick of people telling me it’s a good lesson to have learned,"Like okay, I get it. I may now have some abilities to ‘spot the narcissist’, but I would 100% willingly give that back to have never dated him at all. Couldn’t I please be one of those people to have never been taken advantage of? And I’m not naive. I went in to that relationship the most mentally healthy I’d ever been. This was 7 years ago, I’m on the other end of mentally healthy now and what I wouldn’t give to just erase him from my existence entirely. 

When people tell me ‘well at least you know better now!’ I just can’t help from fuming.

I just want to call bullshit on people who say  ‘yes I’ve been through the works but I came through with SO much more’. 

If I’d never dated the narcissist I would’ve been able to: 1. Keep all my money (great, yes please) 2. Have zero trust issues (great, yes please give me more) 3. WOULDNT HAVE WASTED MY CHILD REARING YEARS (fucking A).

Tell us about your great spouse so we can see examples of what a normal relationship should look like.,"I read through this sub from time to time and I’m always so sad that so many women have shitty partners, and it can take years or decades before they realize it’s not ok. I’ve been with my husband for 22 years, married for almost 15. We do not have biological kids but did take in a foster child when she was 14 (she’s now 21) who had mental health issues. Throughout our marriage:

- We both clean what needs to be cleaned in the house, when it needs it. I take the bathroom because I don’t mind, and he often does “deep clean” stuff like baseboards and oven.
- He usually cooks dinner and I help out, we clean up together.
- We do our own laundry.
- We shared responsibility in raising a difficult teenager and he took the lead in figuring out what mental health supports she needed and got it lined up. We both attended the parenting program together and approached it as a team.
- A few years ago I got a big opportunity in my career which required an international move (for me) and he 100% supported me in everything and never made me feel bad for working long hours. When he visited me overseas, he cooked the meals and kept the house clean.
- We have seen the same couples therapist for about 15 years, both together and separately, to work through issues that crop up. 

This is not to say we haven’t had problems, but we’ve worked through them together, as partners. I’ve never felt like I’ve had the heavier load and I’ve always felt supported and like he’s my biggest cheerleader.

I feel like we have a healthy marriage so wanted to share what that looks like in the hopes that those that are carrying the burden realize it is NOT normal or healthy. I hope this doesn’t come across as bragging, and I have no idea how I landed such a great guy because my parents don’t have the most balanced and healthy relationship. My early relationships were shit, including emotional and physical abuse, so I have fallen into the trap myself and know it can easily happen.

I'm sorry, i dont know what i'm asking for here, I just need to rant...

UPDATE : 

Hey!
So this post has blown up, and I wanted to update this.

Many prolifers here have been very kind, quite a few have been rude, and a few more have been telling me to burn in Hell in private messages.

To the people who want to debate about abortion. I'd love to answer to you all, but answering individually isn't working out for me, so here is a copy paste of a discussion I had with someone in PM yesterday, with additionnal info on things I think I missed. I hope it helps, and sorry I can't answer individually anymore.


First of all, no, i am not necessarily the only one in control of who puts semen in there (see condoms breaking, rape, stealthing etc)

I answered this in a other comment, that was deleted, but basically, here it is :

I am very serious about my birth control. I have been on condoms, pills, and am currently on a copper IUD. So far, my BC has cost me about 1000 $. I am 25.

Condoms maybe 60, im not quite sure. bC pill about 160/year for 4 years, and my copper IUD was a total of about 200. Thats after reimbursment.

Last year, i had bad health problems. My period, which is usually very regular (we're talking clockwork here) did not come for over a week. I had to spend 8 days freaking out, because pregnancy tests are not reliable for about 10 days after the missed period. Fortunately, my period ended up coming, I had missed it because I had lost a lot of weight in very little time, and i had been put on medication that upset my cycle.

I was on the pill at that time, but the pill is not 100% effective, no BC is.

Birth control is expensive, and not accessible to all, partly because of cost, partly because of information, partly because lf geography, and partly because of laws.

Cost I have explained. They can be very prohibitive for a ton of people. Maternal health is not covered well, and the usa has the highest maternal death rate in any developed country. Many Birth controls are expensive, and not reimbursed by Social Security or by Insurance, whether fully or even just partially.

Information : planned parenthood is being defunded despite mainly providing care that is not abortion for people who cant afford it, and is a big provider of information, as well as of affordable birth control. And the usa is pushing abstinence only sex ed, which has been proven time and again to be counter productive, and harmful, particularly to younger teens. Many of them are vaguely aware of pregnancy, but they are not taught how to use BC, or how to use it properly. Because their Sex Ed isn't accurate or helpful.

Geography: Many big states only have a few centers that provide this type of healthcare. Some only have one. Going to a center would mean travelling long distances, which costs time and money that many cannot spare.

Laws: Prolife lawmakers are trying to close centers. They have also passed bills that enable pharmacists and doctors to refuse not just abortion, but also birth control, citing religious beliefs. These bills specify that said doctors or pharmacist do not need to give you your prescription back, which then means you have to repeat the process until you find a doctor and pharmacist that accepts to provide healthcare that you are paying for. Again, very prohibitive. Which means you could have to go to 3+ doctors and pharmacists, and pay everytime, without receiving the products you paid for.

Additionally, many women do not have a regular cycle. Some women only get periods every 2-3months. It doesn't mean they can't get pregnant. Cycles are hard to manage. Anorexic women who are on the road to recovery don't necessarily know when they start being fertile again, because the fertility will start before the first menstruation of her recovery. Trans men going through hormone replacement therapy  can still get pregnant, it's hard to tell when they stop being fertile, if ever. Stress, depression, anxiety can stop your cycle, and you won't know before the first period that it has started again. Medication can affect it, or clash with hormonal birth control. There are many factors that can change a cycle's regularity, and they are really hard to control.

Vasectomies and tubal ligation : They are expensive, and tubal ligation is really hard to get if you are a younger women, or if you don't have children. Many doctors will only do it with a signed not from the husband or boyfriend.
and they are not 100% effective. 
And getting pregnant despite having had tubal ligation means the fetus will likely tear your womb open. You do not have periods when you have had a tubal ligation. You won't know you are pregnant until well into the pregnancy.

In this context, abortions are bound to be in demand for people who have done their best to not get pregnant, but end up so anyway, do to causes out of their control. And after taking away so many opportunities for us to not get pregnant, they also want to deny us abortions.

I can absolutely understand that someone would find abortion wrong. I think it's definitely not a good thing, but for many people, it's the lesser evil outcome.

Even if it's just that you have regrets because you had unprotected sex the night before, you can still get the morning after pill (unless you encounter the previously mentioned problems with doctors and pharmacists).

But many prolifers seem to think that women get abortion as a form of birth control, or change their mind about pregnancy, which just isn't the case!

And the problem if you only want to make abortion available for rape cases is that how do you figure it out?

Does she have to prove rape in court? Because that is going to take a lot more than 9 months, if it ever happens. It also means that pro life judges will refuse to condemn the rapist, because it would also mean killing the baby. Then you'd have a rape victim who would be denied justice, but also forced to carry and possibly even raise her rapists child. A child whom the rapist could then even claim parental rights on, and use as leverage against his victim to further abuse her.

The person who has been raped doesn't necessarily have the resources to take their rapist to court, either. 
I don't think you can be in favor of abortion just for rape cases, without realizing that, in effect, you have to allow people to decide for themselves whether they were raped or not, without bringing forward proof.

Finally, a word on Adoption :

The child foster care system is broken. There are many more children to adopt, than there are people who adopt. 
Adoption takes a LONG time. A time during which the child will either be in a center, with no parental figure, little supervision/guidance, few resources, emotional support and stability. Or they will be in foster care.

Foster care is dangerous. You can be in a great family, you can be in an okay family, or you can be in a shit family. You can be in a family that's only here to collect a paycheck from you, or even in a family that fosters in order to abuse.

Additionnally, the Foster care system yelds the highest amount of people who turn 18 and end up either in the streets, or in prison. Because you go from being underage and having a bit of government assistance, to becoming and adult and being pretty much on your own. 

If you don't have the resources available because you were in a bad family, because you weren't in a foster home long enough to make contacts/build relationships, then it is likely you will end up in crime or on the streets, because you have nothing else.

I don't know if it's the right answer, but I would rather abort a potential child, than give birth to it only to give it up to a system where I have very little chance to believe that they will be happy, healthy and fullfilled.

And not everyone can become a parent. Particularly not if they have been forced into it. If you can't entrust me with an abortion, how can you entrust me with a child?

It's just... I don't like abortion, but there's nothing good that can come from banning it.

I'm so tired of being cast aside with people not taking the time to think of all the consequences of these policies...

Anyways, I hope this clarifies it.

And when I posted the original post yesterday, I had been getting yelled at by prolifers for saying that I didn't believe abortion should be regulated. I had been getting verbal abuse, threats of physical abuse (I know it's just online on a nanonymous website, but boy do some people know graphic language that makes the threat feel so very real). And some of these people were telling me that they didn't care what arguments I had in favor of abortion, that they wouldn't listen anyway because I was the lowest of the low in terms of human trash (but in more colorful language).

I am asking you to be compassionnate towards people, because most of us, if we end up accidentally pregnant, have taken many steps to avoid this situation. These steps are not necessarily enough.",1557592366.0,bnanaPow,TwoXChromosomes
What is something you put up with before that you now realize is unacceptable?,"For me is disrespectful behavior dressed up as jokes, and people diminishing my success. Either behavior is damaging to a person's self-worth and chips away at your self-esteem. A sense of self-worth and healthy self-esteem impact every decision that you make in life.

I refuse to make myself small for other people. Anyone that needs you to be less than who and what you are is toxic to you. I no longer ignore anyone that puts me down and says ""it's just a joke"". If it was a joke I would be laughing too. Passive-aggressive insults are not jokes.

What is something you put up with that you now realize is unacceptable? I'm talking about in friendships, romantic partners, relatives, colleagues, employers/employees, any relationship.",1720055541.0,Understoodatlast,TwoXChromosomes
"I taught my 9yo the true power of the word ""p*ssy""","She was playing a multi-player computer game and some idiot called her a pussy for hiding from the monster. She asked what that word meant.

I told her that it's a word that's slang for vagina. I explained that in the context it was being used, the person meant it as an insult. A coward. A scardy cat. And, like as if being a girl made her lesser.

I said, ""I'm going to tell you a secret that no other kid you know will know."" Her eyes got big as saucers and she was practically jumping out of her seat. ""Vaginas are amazing. They have to stretch to this big to push out a baby. Women get their periods every month. And cramps hurt. Men don't know what pain is. So many men get a cold and act like they're dying. So the next time someone calls you a pussy, brush it off and say to yourself, 'Hey thanks!' Because vaginas, and the women they are attached to, are amazing, strong, and resilient.""

Then we watched videos on YouTube of men trying period pain simulators and laughed.

The End.


Edit: Wow! My first Reddit Cares AND my first report to the admins! I'm touched.

Those who are triggered about the men and pain bit try to remember that parenting isn't a 1.5 min conversation. This story took place over a 20 min time frame. I answered lots of questions, gave opposing viewpoints, and I distinctly remember clarifying to her that not ALL men are babies when they get a cold. I'm trying to also teach her what is acceptable behavior in a relationship. Waiting on your partner hand and foot because they have the sniffles is not part of healthy and balanced relationship.

For those triggered by a 9yo using online chat, I've fought this for years, but when you try to co-parent with a man-child who has zero respect for you and an estranged mother who takes every opportunity to try to paint you as the bad parent to your child, there are just some battles you can't win.

For those triggered by the YouTube videos, they make those videos funny on purpose. We honestly did more cheering for the ladies because they took it like a champ while the dudes cringed and wiggled around. If you want to be pissed, go comment on those videos.

And finally, to the men that have come into a women's centered subreddit. [Etymology of pussy](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=24012#:~:text=There's%20a%20plausible%20and%20well,development%20of%20pussy%20%3D%20female%20genitals) I very, very rarely hear a woman use the word pussy as an insult. As I told the kiddo, ""If you're going to insult someone, use asshole instead of pussy. Because pussies are amazing, and what comes out of assholes?

"My male gynecologist refused to do lab work, suggested I see a psychiatrist instead","This happened a year ago, but I'm still seething about it.
I (38f) had a yearly with my male gynecologist, & after my exam I explained to him that over the past few months I've been feeling more lethargic than usual, wasn't sleeping well AT ALL, experiencing a lot of brain fog, & my sex drive, which used to be through the roof, is now completely gone which was really affecting my relationship with my boyfriend. Not to mention my I had put on a crap ton of weight over a short amount of time. I told him I suspected perimenopause since my mom & my sister had both gone through menopause in their mid 40s. I asked if he could run some lab work, specifically my thyroid levels, an A1C (since my sister had recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, even though she isn't obese, & eats fairly healthy), & horomone levels to see if I may be correct about the perimenopause. He refused to do lab work, & said I was too young for perimenopause. He suggested I make myself have sex with my boyfriend even if I didn't want to bc, in his words, ""if you keep doing it, you'll eventually want to do it."" I had some bad experiences with sex in my teenage years, so doing it even if I didn't want to do did not sit well with me. Then he said I suggested I see a psychiatrist, which I already see a therapist. Then he went on to tell me I should try to do some random fun things, & proceeded to tell me how he just took a trip to Europe, but his luggage got lost, so he just bought all new clothes once he got there. Like, cool story bro, but I don't make a doctor's salary, not to mention the lethargy...I really did not feel up to taking a vacation. He also told me he couldn't test hormone levels bc those tests aren't accurate. Now, however, when you go to his website it says he does hormone replacement therapy, so someone is definitely checking hormone levels.
A few weeks later I went to a clinic & the nurse practitioner was very helpful & offered to run a complete lab panel, but said she couldn't do hormone testing, & said I needed to ask my gyno about that (ummm...) Anyway my thyroid & A1C was fine, but my vit D level was 8. She said that was the lowest she's ever seen, & now I'm on vit D supplements. My lethargy is somewhat better now, although I've learned my BP runs extremely low (like 60/30s low) My doctor was concerned about that, but didn't want to treat it, but I bought a BP cuff to use at home & I've been keeping a record of my readings to show him at appt next week-just throwing that in there bc I know that can affect my energy levels.

Sex drive is still trash.

I'm so angry at my gynecologist, & frankly insulted he threw the ""just see a psychiatrist"" line at me. I plan on switching doctors before its time for my next annual.",1706823951.0,Rollersk885,TwoXChromosomes
This holiday season I have been in a major mood calling BS and standing up for myself -- which is not normal,"I don't know what has gotten into me. I think of myself as the adaptive one in most of my relationships. In order to placate relationships, I typically take the blame or accommodate others because I want peace. I think a lot of women do this. But I'm realizing that if we don't stand up for ourselves and say, ""No, that is not how it is. I deserve better than this"" then no one will.

I spoke with my mom. She will make plans with me for the holidays (the only time I come home to the east coast) then cancel them last minute because her husband needs those days for his family or his mental health or whatever. And basically my mom asks me to change everything in my plans to make it work for her.

After a pretty bad event last Thanksgiving, I decided I would make holiday plans with the family members who prioritize me and let her work around them if she had to change. Again, this Christmas, plans change and my mom demanded me to change my days with the other three families to accommodate her.

And I defended myself (whaaaat) I said, ""I don't think you realize how much you hurt me when you do this every year. You won't come out and visit but you also won't prioritize my visits. I've tried to communicate how it has hurt me and you have never apologized. I'm not mad at you. You have your priorities and I accept that. But I will not be criticized then for prioritizing people who *make time for me*.""

Ok. End /longrant.

For whoever needs to hear this: You are awesome. If things in your life are not the way you want them to be, you have the power, courage, and goddamn right to change them because you deserve to have the life that you want. And if you are telling someone in your life that they have hurt you and their response is that you are the problem, that is not a person you need.

\*Edit: Whew. It sounds like many of us have felt this way. We feel like we are supposed to be smaller, to take up less space, to be a hostess without needs, and a person without desires. I hope this empowers whoever is reading to know you are worth taking up space, stating your needs, and walking away from people who counter that. It is your absolute right to set boundaries with unhealthy people.

\*Edit 3: I've removed the part in regards to my relationship. After a few negative comments, I don't feel the need to expose the most important relationship in my life to criticism.

We're not therapists,"I keep seeing the fact that a lot of men are lonely and having a mental health crisis being directed at women. Yet, I’ve not seen one of them mention mental health services, except a single one that said men have a stigma from other men around going. So we’re supposed to fight the patriarchy for them too? They’re not advocating for easier access to mental health services. It’s even in the name. Since there is a crisis, why is there not more demand in this field? Why aren’t more men reaching out to their buddies and telling them to go to therapy instead of trying to use it as a “gotcha” moment? Why isn’t it followed by any attempt at a solution that doesn’t involve someone else taking on managing their mental health for them?

We’re just average people with our own mental health issues and struggles going on. The average person is not a therapist. Trying to get back at women for not fixing it will still not make us therapists, and nobody is about to fight them to go to therapy or give up their bodies/affection to throw a band-aid over it. I've even seen guys who are in a relationship still not happy that other women aren't paying them attention instead of realizing that maybe it was, in fact, just a band-aid.

I know therapy is not the end all be all and there are a lot more problems in our society, but it’s not even brought up as an option.

“They can’t find anything else being offered, so all they have is redpill content to turn to”

You mean to tell me, that on this big ass internet, there is nothing they can find?

Healthy Gammer gg, Nicky Scorpio, Kenneth Fleece. Those are just three healthy male influencers that I’ve stumbled across. Why is it that I, an adult woman with a job, can find decent influencers offering helpful advice but young men who grew up on the internet can’t?

“They don’t feel like they have a place in society”

Why is it patriarchy or bust? There is still plenty to do in society. Why are we supposed to find something for them?

 

""There's nothing specifically for men""

This is like those shampoos that have to be labeled ""for men"" to understand that it can still apply to them.

“Nobody is listening to men”

I have male friends who come to me when they’re going through it, but they’re also adults who realize that some things require a professional because I can’t solve them. They get this because we’ve worked on building actual friendships (not fuckzones) and I know they’d do the same for me. I don’t just expect it from strangers.


“Girls are exceling more than boys”

Maybe less redpill videos would be a start. But what else are they offering? Asking why that is and working on a solution or blaming women?

Therapy was looked down on and men were even more tight-lipped but now that people are opening up about mental health, why is the second part about how we’re working on it ignored in lieu of looking to us when we're repeating?

 

 It seems like the emotional labor is again on us:

Learning social skills – too much emotional labor

Making friends or figuring out how friends are made – too much emotional labor

Finding a therapist – too much emotional labor

Trying to come up with a solution to the male mental health problems – too much emotional labor

Learning how women are managing – too much emotional labor

Self-reflecting and working on themselves – too much emotional labor

Learning how to date and meeting people – too much emotional labor

Understanding that that means their personality and not how much they lift weights – too much emotional labor

Talking to their male friends – too much emotional labor, not manly, and no sex

Are the BoyMomsTM ok? Because social media boy moms are *major red flags*,"I'm a mother of a 1 year old boy but thank god, I'm not a ""boy momTM*. I recently started getting these reels about boy moms who are talking about how ""some girl will steal her son..."" all while her son is a baby and has 3 teeth.  Seriously, ladies, I dont think this is funny... or a joke... as millennial moms, we have to be better. We have access to so much self-help, please don't feel like your baby is ""yours"", as if they will never be allowed to have a life of their own and families of their own. 

I get the feeling of being attached and being with your son 24/7, but please work on outgrowing that feeling. It's absolutely not healthy to think of your future DIL as s ""girl who steals boys from their moms"". It's so creepy. 

Also, enjoy motherhood in the present instead of wondering what life will look like 30 years from now. 

I know emeshment is a thing and that people with dysfunctional romantic relationships attach too much worth to their boy child. But seriously, if this sounds like you, get couples therapy. Don't get more and more involved into the delusion that your baby will forever be a baby who won't have a life of their own.

Appreciation for a healthy co-parenting relationship,"Quick back story: 

I am a mom to an 8 year old. I’ve been a single parent since my son was about 7 months old. 

My ex had a child from a previous relationship. That child was 2 when we got together and 5 when we split up. My ex always led me to believe that his ex-wife was a horrible, manipulative woman who was difficult to deal with. 

The first few years, her and I had no relationship and would only see one another at their custody exchanges. After my child was born, it opened my eyes to the manipulative, abusive narcissist that *he* was. I left him and had essentially been raising our child on my own, with him opting for every other weekend. It has been over 2 years since he went no contact with our child and his other child. He still reaches out to her and I to harass us, call us names, and otherwise try to make us miserable, but has not attempted to contact our children. 

The other child’s mom and I had a chance to really talk and get to know one another about 4 years ago. Since then, we decided that regardless of their father, these boys would always have each other and us. We take them to one another’s sporting events, plan our yearly summer vacations together, and always support one another. We’ve always joked around and said if he ended up with another child, we’d wait for that woman to see him for who he really is, and then we’d welcome her and that child with open arms. 

Today, I had a support hearing (bc, believe it or not, he wants *us* to pay *him* child support), and she called me beforehand to help calm my nerves. Her hearing is tomorrow and I’ll be calling her beforehand to let her know that I’m here to support her, as well. 

It just made me sit back and realize, even though the last 7.5 years have been really tough and stressful, I am so thankful to have a great co-parenting relationship out of it. So I just have to say, Nicole, you’re amazing and I’m lucky to have you! 

For anyone in a similar circumstance who may have an unhealthy co-parenting relationship with their child’s other parent, if you have the opportunity to have a Nicole, take a leap of faith. It could be the best thing that ever happened for your kid. I know it is for mine.",1677552524.0,slynja,TwoXChromosomes
"My story of being the front woman of The Willis Clan, the oldest of 12 kids, and the survivor of lifelong sexual abuse at the hands of my father.","
At the beginning of 2016 I was 23 years old.  I was known as the blonde lead singer, fiddle player and principle songwriter of The Willis Clan and the eldest sister of 12 kids.   We performed on tour frequently and we were finishing up filming the second season of a reality TV show about our family.  A fourth official album was in the works and there was always something exciting and challenging coming up on the calendar.

The turn of that year was also the darkest period of my life.  The truth of what I was living every day was nothing like what people saw on the outside.  And that jarring discrepancy hadn’t come out of nowhere.  There was a wound that had always been a part of my world and it had never been addressed.  Now it was going to kill me if I didn’t find a way to get free of its power. 

My story is complicated.  It’s deeply private, personal and way too long to share in full —just as the story of anyone’s life would be. However, after much recent deliberation and soul searching, I have come to realize that I feel a responsibility to the truth itself and my conscience demands a public denouncement of the previous life I helped hide for so long. Speculation and confusion has muddied the waters of late and I’ve found that the longer I go without speaking up, the longer I feel trapped in the continued power of my past.

As far back as I can remember, I was sexually abused by my father.  I figure I was around three years old in some of the earliest memories.  Initially, I had no way to know that anything was wrong. When I did eventually come to realize the fact, I had no way to accurately express what was happening to me. There followed immense shame, distrust and hurt throughout my childhood – even in the happy times.  Thus ran the two parallel storylines that became my life. 

An initial awareness of questionable behavior began when I was around nine years old.  Something (I’m still not sure what) caused my mother to become suspicious of my father’s interactions.  I didn’t realize there was zero evidence of anything specific and all I did was nod uncertainly when a few general questions were asked by my mother.  I heard my mother raise her voice to my father for the first time in my life and I thought the adults would figure it out.  I didn’t understand that my father simply denied any wrongdoing and became more secretive and dangerous from then on.

Suffice it to say my father controlled the family in every single area of life.  Underneath the outward foundations of family, religion and homeschooling with an emphasis in the arts, there was a constant current of manipulation, domination, fear and favor.  There was very little room inside the bubble of my world to imagine that there was any alternative.  Looking back now, it’s almost impossible to face the fact of what my life once used to be.  Many things were normal for me that should have never been met with anything other than outrage.  The abuse developed and ebbed at various intervals over the years and into puberty.  The most graphic sexual abuse faded off for me when I was around seventeen years old but many inappropriate actions and attentions continued. 

From time to time the ever growing but still nebulous awareness grew to include more members of the family.  Over the years periodic confrontations happened between my parents and eventually involved various siblings as we struggled to pin down the monster in the shadows that we couldn’t seem to pull into the light.  I feel like I truly knew that certain other members of my family were being sexually abused and I felt they knew this about me too. Conversations were had, tears were cried and we questioned how to “deal” with the “situation”. But I now realize that since we all were different ages with completely different viewpoints, separate experiences and limited vocabularies, even when we tried to speak to each other, each person thought they were talking about something different. 

Once I was no longer being graphically abused, the worst of it became like a purposely forgotten nightmare and I tried to thrive in a way I hadn’t been able to before.  Though I was confused by the many rigorous and philosophical beliefs that were channeled into me by my father, I was getting older and dreaming of a life where I had a future of my own with the possibility of freedom, independence and love.  It bears saying that my firsthand exposure to these things was extremely limited but I was not completely broken inside as to think that they didn’t exist at all. 

My childhood explorations in music and writing provided me a personal tool for self-expression that I now partially credit with saving my life.  The innocent, hurt, curious, hopeful child hidden within me gravitated to the magic of storytelling’s emotional truth and wisdom.  Through my love of these things I was able to preserve a connection to the deep parts of me that I didn’t understand or accept or couldn’t explain to the world.  It helped me connect with others with authenticity when words failed.

Over the next few years, my daily life transformed dramatically as my family became more and more public.  My father shaped us from child students to child performers and at some vaguely discernible point we became a touring dance troupe and then band.  He always promoted his philosophy, showcasing the family as the living proof of the validity of his methods and beliefs.  I remember at one point being a model member of this strange and highly performance oriented group, complete with a belief on nearly every subject, and constantly ready to make a range of demonstrations on cue.

With time, I came to sense the increasing divide between where my life was heading and where I realized I wanted to go.  Bigger platforms and higher octane schedules led to pressures that can stress even the healthiest of systems.  Our family system was disturbingly sick.  For a long time now I had felt like I was going through life with a massive bomb strapped to my chest that I knew would one day detonate. In 2011, I wrote a song called Speak My Mind wherein I wondered if I ever did get the courage to speak out and break free, would other people understand me or love me or be there for me? I was desperate for help but also felt that anyone who came close enough to help me would get hurt.  Could I knowingly do that to someone?  I was getting glimpses of different lifestyles, examples of other beliefs and other lives but I knew I was not going to get from where I was to where I wanted to be without major changes.

My husband, Sean, came into my life at the beginning of 2015.  He was not the first person to teach me what love can be like but he truly changed my life forever.  Neither of us were ever alone in our journey; there is a special and beautiful thread of people who shaped us throughout our lives before we knew each other and there is a community that was there with us through the hardest parts of our fight.

There were many rules in my family for communication, friendships and relationships but it universally came down to my father’s favor and if that was lost, any person, family or group would be cut off by whatever means necessary.  My husband and I had that general favor for the first few months and he was welcomed in to experience the full performance of The Willis Clan in up-close action.  Sean came over to spend time with the family countless times and visited our home church meetings. He brought me flowers on Valentine's Day and in March we went on one date with chaperones. However, it wasn’t long before our growing connection became a threat to my father’s control and the favor evaporated.

April’s schedule brought a band tour and I hit the road with my family on our tour bus.  It was the day before my 23rd birthday and we were in Minnesota performing and filming our tv show.  I came into my hotel room that night to find my mother and some of my sisters sitting on the bed crying with that look on their face I had seen so many times before.  The coldest, blackest pit opened up in my stomach because no words needed to be said for me to know something had happened. How was I here again?  I could not stay in denial about my past because it obviously wasn’t staying in the past even though at times I had tried so hard to forgive and forget.  Things were not over.  They had never been over. Sexual abuse was still happening.  And I knew it.  Deep in my gut.  Life seemed thin and fragile and about to shatter in that moment.  The delicate balance of ignorance and fear and hope was about to break wide open.  I was the adult now.  Something had to change.  I said things to my father that night.  I told him I would not ignore it this time.  I told him I would leave as soon as I could find out how to do so.  Other family members echoed similar declarations. (Again, this is another situation that my mom, my siblings and I have been able to talk about more recently and peel back the layers of confusion and conflict to understand that we all had different viewpoints and interpretations of events during that night.)

From that day on, our public life continued on without missing a beat - If anything, it intensified.  All threats or ultimatums made to my father were brushed aside and the runaway train that was The Willis Clan gained speed.  I kept up the outward show but within the family, things began to fall apart for me.  I continued my relationship with Sean without my parent’s consent and it eventually went completely underground.  As things got weirder, he struggled to make sense of the situation.  He shared books and resources with me not realizing just how valuable I found the information at that time.  I came to view what my father had done with increasing horror.  I was less and less cooperative with him and had to face the mounting consequences.

The middle of August arrived and found our family neck deep in filming a live concert DVD.  Things were strained and rehearsals included huge blowups and power struggles between my father and I or sometimes another sibling.  That weekend, Sean sent me a message saying he thought he had “figured out what had happened in my past”.  I confirmed.  I remember him asking me if I was safe.  I looked around and, though I didn’t voice it, I realized I was not.  No one had ever told their truth.  No one had ever truly stood up to my father.  I personally had never shared the details of what he had done to me.  Doing so would put me in danger but it had to be done. I sat down and wrote a fourteen page document about the worst abuse.  It poured out of me in terrible detail and it was the first time I felt the power of its story.  I showed the letter to my mother who was rightly outraged.  My father refused to read it and accused me of lying.  I had taken my first step towards speaking out, but I had shared my story with another victim trapped in the same prison as me. My father lashed out at both of us with whatever threats necessary to maintain his control and began consistently threatening my mom with the lives of the entire family. I continued to look for a way out on my own but it can seem impossible to jump off a runaway train.

When we arrived home from tour that autumn, I was somehow able to go out with Sean one more time.  When I arrived home that night, my family had been made aware of my secret and inappropriate communication with him and Sean was excommunicated.  My father threatened his life.  I was forced by my father to “break up with him” multiple times over the following months.  All manner of technology or communication was taken away from me and even secret letters were found out.  It was imperative to keep me closed off from all help as I was now fighting to get out. My life amounted to a type of house arrest. I sank into the first depression of my life and lost close to fifteen pounds.  We continued to perform, to film and for the first time I saw the reality of my life.  The abuse was in my mind every day.  How could I have stayed this long?  My father sought to stamp out my rebellion and became increasingly violent towards me even in front of the family.  I felt myself losing my grip on sanity.  I was accused of being the only problem in the family, ruining everything.  It was said I was possessed by a demon.  The way things were escalating, I began to fear for my life.  In January, my father assaulted me on the tour bus in front of the entire family.  He blamed my disobedience and defied everyone though my mother and siblings tried to interfere. A police car pulled up behind us and when the officer entered, I hid in my bunk to hide the blood and the forming bruises. Everyone put on their show faces. In that moment, I knew I was betraying myself.  I was the one keeping me prisoner.  (Again, all of this is extremely abbreviated. I have focused on my own personal narrative and tried to distill events down to the most impactful points.)

I woke up one morning during the first week of April, not knowing it was the day I was going to finally leave.  The TV show had just finished filming, we were in TN at a new rental house and we had a few weeks before our next gig.  Halfway through the morning, my brother Jair and I had a disagreement and he went to our father.  Dad came down and confronted me.  When I didn’t apologize, he took off his belt and beat me like when I was younger. He said it was his god-given responsibility to punish me. It was in that moment I knew. The threats and violence stopped working. No matter how it happened, I would leave by tonight.

The rest of the day was like a blur.  I had tried to leave multiple times before and was always physically prevented.  But something was different this time.  I was almost in a coma, not saying much, one half of me completely paralyzed in fear and the other half slowly proceeding — almost calmly, holding each little inch of ground I gained. One after another there were various threats of further violence and legal repercussions from dad. My mother and siblings made religious and emotional appeals. Everyone was terrified of what would happen if I really left. But these things had lost their power over me.  I was so far retreated into myself that I somehow found the trembling strength to keep insisting. I was allowed to use a phone to call a friend and without being given an explanation, she told me I was welcome to come and stay for as long as I needed. I had no plan but the immediate steps eventually took shape. Two of my siblings offered to drive me. Sean had gotten me an emergency phone that I had been too afraid to use. I now dug it out from between my mattress and boxspring and sent a message saying I was coming out.  In every moment of that car ride, I felt I was about to wretch my guts out. I had never felt so physically sick with fear and a grimacing determination.

I woke up the next morning in a strange new world. My 24th birthday was only a few days away. It had taken way too long and at times I thought I would die but I had finally escaped. I had left everything but a few clothes and personal items. It was astounding to me that life continued on like nothing had happened; the earth continued to turn. One day at a time, I tried to begin again. I saw my family a few times after I left and I felt such guilt towards leaving my mom and siblings and also struggled with an overwhelming responsibility to the band that I’d left in such a lurch. I helped them with a few projects but it was incredibly strange and I felt like I didn’t exist as soon as we were off stage or off camera. The contrast of being outside of my family’s bubble and then being back in the thick of it was overwhelming. Even though I had left, I felt immense pressure not to mess with what my family continued to portray to the public. I could not yet find the power to break that hold.

I tried to block my family from my mind as I dove into the safety net that emerged around me.  I knew now that I could not break said hold without keeping away from the whole system. Friends and eventually various support groups helped me in seeing a therapist with extensive trauma training.  People who I’d never met showed up for me in a way I’d never experienced before. I learned about trauma, abuse, recovery, dysfunctional family systems and finally found the vocabulary to accurately describe what had happened to me.  At first my mouth would not move no matter how hard I tried to speak and my body would shake and shut down.  But these words had power and their exact meaning told the truth I had experienced.  There is something profound in finally being able to speak for yourself, to tell your story and know you are right. It was as if speaking my story began to make my truth accessible in the real world.

Around 4 months after I left, another friend stepped forward to save the rest of my family.  He reported my father for suspicion of sexual abuse and the official investigation started.  The case was given to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.  When they contacted me, I went in and ended up speaking with them the whole rest of that day.  I was able to give them a long and confident testimony which was eventually used to create the arrest warrant.  I was warned not to speak to my family at this time and if they reached out, I should let the TBI do their job.  There was great concern on how to keep everyone alive and safe while trying to apprehend my father.  It was no exaggeration to fear a violent confrontation, standoff, kidnapping or worse. It was a harrowing few weeks but my father was finally arrested. 

I truly think that the full extent of the abuse will never be known; I know even with this partial account of my personal experience alone, it is complex.  I also believe that no matter the method of telling, no one else will ever fully understand what it is like to live through something like that unless you too have been there in your own way. The investigation unearthed so many more things that my family as a whole was unaware of and there are still sometimes no words to describe what happened in it’s fullest magnitude. Healing is a lifelong process. I remain personally dedicated to always leaning further into my recovery and pursuing my own education so I will never be without the tools that would prevent me from [website blog link](www.jessicawillisfisher.com) held prisoner in such a situation again.  As my mom and siblings move forward with their lives, I am so grateful for the chance we have had to heal and continue to grow closer  – most recently through the process of me preparing and sharing this account.  My mom and siblings each have their own powerful stories and they are all beautiful survivors. I have felt such support from them in the telling of this story and I look forward to supporting them in theirs.

I have a beautiful life for which I am incredibly grateful.  I married my amazing husband last year.  He too has his own truly inspiring story throughout this crazy tale and I’m so thankful that he constantly invited me towards a better life since the moment I met him.  I have had so much help and support from so many other people and organizations. Most recently, I spent the beginning of February attending an amazing program at a place called Onsite which, as it turns out, was the place my husband was working when I first met him. 

I am not currently a part of The Willis Clan band but I will aways be a part of the Willis family. There is much to learn for myself about the truth of healthy relationships, faith, family, home, success, fulfillment and so much more. I appreciate the grace that is given by those closest to me. I assert my right to protect the privacy of my personal life while still feeling free to explore and passionately pursue my dreams and goals. I am excited by the possibilities of the future and the beauty of the now. 

If you are someone whose honesty and vulnerability invited me further into true connection, you have helped save my life. I can still struggle with the wish that I could have stood up sooner, been stronger, saved myself and my family in the way that was desperately needed for so long.  But I have learned that I did the best I could at the times when it felt like there was no choice. I didn’t know until I finally knew, I couldn’t stand until I finally stood.  There is no shame in finally being strong. I am a survivor. 

As both my 26th birthday and the anniversary of my leaving draws near, I find it amazing to reflect on the past two years.  I have learned that even when I do find the courage to speak my mind, not everyone will understand or be there for me.  But that’s not why I am doing this.  For me not to speak up and acknowledge what has happened would be like hiding in the bus all over again. It would be to hide my own painful past and pretend that I wasn’t a part of the act because I am afraid of what might happen or whether my story will be misunderstood.  Writing and sharing this piece is an important step for me in owning my story, loving myself and others, and moving forward to live the life that I truly want to live. 

If you too are a survivor, you are not alone.

"Tips? In a 'healthy' relationship finally, but surprised at how low my self-esteem is! And the anxiety!","Hi everyone :)

I've (31F) been in a relationship with my BF (35M) for almost 6 months. The past 2-3 years have been tough for me because I broke up with my long-term partner (who cheated on me, wanted to have an open relationship, etc.... spent almost all my 20s with him and fed into an unhealthy dynamic where I did almost everything) and I had a really painful rebound that affected me for almost a year. 

I had horrible anxiety while navigating through those two relationships and am still in counselling, albeit not as frequently. The whole thing was somewhat traumatic. 

Current BF and I get along really well. We met online and I wasn't expecting anything... in fact, I initially thought he was boring! But he's been so kind and patient in a way that I wasn't familiar with, especially at the beginning of a relationship. We both agreed that we love each other and want to be together long-term/'forever'. 

The past month-ish has hit me like a pile of bricks. I've started becoming even more anxious because I realised how much I love him. I feel like I'm never good enough for people, for him. I'm always annoying. Through therapy, I realised so much of my low self-esteem comes from feeling like I'm never the 'right amount' of anything (e.g., TOO emotional, TOO sensitive). I'm worried that he'll decide I'm not worth it, lose interest, stop loving me. So I over-analyse everything to an embarrassing extent, like... 'Oh he didn't put \[insert emoji\] into his messages'. Doesn't help that he's quite a dry texter and admits to not being very expressive and quiet! 

I've had bursts of anxiety and brought it up to him, which is a first for me. He's been really understanding every time. He says he loves me, he thinks the relationship is going well. I ask him if it's annoying that I need reassurance, and he looked at me and smiled and said 'that's fine' as if it was such an obvious, easy request. There's nothing he'd change about me because I'm my own person, and that I should talk to him if I feel insecure. 

I am trying to rationalise my anxieties, but it'd be great to stop the thoughts from coming in the first place. I feel ashamed because I'm in a \*good\* situation... and a friend joked that, because BF is so nice, ""if anything bad happens, it's my fault""... 

I've been trying to for years to improve my self-esteem. It's gotten better, but entering this new relationship has really blown things up and has made me feel more vulnerable. I'm anxious a lot and I'm tired of overreading. Has anyone else been in this situation and has pushed through it? I'd love advice. Thank you. 

  
**TLDR: I am anxious and have low self-esteem. After years of bad relationships, a nice one has finally popped up and it's making the anxiety and low self-worth EXPLODE LIKE A VOLCANO!**",1714312457.0,Cautious-Goat-6190,TwoXChromosomes
I love my fiancé but I'm tired of him not being available.,"My fiancé and I have a pretty healthy, stable relationship. We get along really well and he- for the most part- is very respectful and supportive. However, there's a couple of things that I'm starting to resent him for and it kills me because I know it shouldn't bother me as much as it does. The first is that we're only intimate once every few weeks, if not a month or two. He will never initiate, and when I ask him if there's anything I can do, he just claims he's not really been interested in sex lately. Okay, that's fine. Maybe I can get over that. The second issue, however, is that he is never available when I need him. He never keeps his phone on him, so I can never get ahold of him when I need to. Ever. Oftentimes, his phone will just be dead because he never charges it. For example: I'm at the mechanic right now to get my tires replaced. I found out that my front two bushings on my control arms are totally blown to bits, and they need to be replaced so it'll be two more hours. I try to call him to get him to pick me up so I can go home and eat breakfast, and there's no answer. Because he's probably still asleep. Even though I told him to keep his phone on him in case I need him. I'm just so frustrated. We've talked about his unavailability SO many times, and every time he says, ""I know I need to he better about it. I'll keep my phone next to me from now on."" BUT HE DOESN'T! I'm tired, and hungry, and I just wish he would be there for me when I need him. It's to the point where I've stopped putting him as my emergency contact on paperwork because I feel like he wouldn't answer the phone if someone called. 

Anyway. I just needed to vent. We're working through the issue, but honestly I just hate that I have to keep having this conversation.

EDIT: Oh dear, this has gotten more attention than I thought it would, haha. Thank you all for reading my innermost feelings. He finally called me when I was on the way home from the mechanic. I told him to let me eat and then we could talk. We had a productive conversation. He argued a bit at first, not realizing why I was really upset. I explained to him that it wasn't that he didn't answer the phone THIS time, it was every time. I wanted to feel like I could rely on him the way that I used to. Then the conversation got a lot more productive. I acknowledged that I had a tendency to steamroll the conversation when I'm upset (like today) and he agreed that he definitely has been ""in a slump"" as he calls it. He agreed to go see someone about it. We talked about our relationship and agreed that we want to stay together, but we agreed to postpone the wedding indefinitely until we both felt like we were in a better place- if that time ever comes. I'm honestly glad I vented on here beforehand. I felt like it got a lot of the frustration out so I could organize my thoughts better.",1677772130.0,captainjayhab,TwoXChromosomes
NO SHE WAS NOT ON MUTE,"Another Redditor posted a TikTok of a girl getting repeatedly interrupted by men in her STEM program. I clicked to see what the comments were like and so many of them were both men and women saying she was obviously on mute because It DoEsnT hAppEn LiKe ThAt.

No, it did happen like that. They clearly heard what she was saying because when the men interrupted her they reiterated what she was saying without acknowledging she was talking.

Getting talked over by men actually does happen. It happens to me when I'm in a meeting for a leadership group at my bible study and we're answering questions. I try to talk but the men in my group just talk to each other for minutes and interrupt me when I try to talk. 

Whenever there's a male-dominated space, the men will always be in a tight conversation while the woman stays silent. It's awful and we need to change it.

Women, speak up!
Men, shut up!",1601661017.0,PurplePlatypusBear20,TwoXChromosomes
Afraid my best friend is getting red-pilled,"So my (28f) best friend (28m) went through a bad breakup recently (I don't want to reveal too much, as it's not my story to tell, but a TLDR is that he ended up hiding a health condition from her and the lie eventually resurfaced and their relationship ended; his ex (20s, f) was fair, understanding, and respectful throughout).  


Ever since then, he has been quite depressed. I have made it clear that he can come vent to me anytime, and he has been taking me up on that offer occasionally. Which is where the trouble started. He has gradually been making more and more comments that are making me worried about the direction his mind has been going in.  


A few weeks after the breakup, he made a comment about how he wished he had cheated, because he had had many chances, but decided to stay loyal. And now he was regretting not taking those chances, since the relationship ended anyway. I thought it was odd of him to say this, but I shrugged it off as a ""he doesn't really mean it, he's just hurting"" type of thing.  


But since then, I have been noticing more and more weird comments. At one point he asked what I thought about Andrew Tate and was genuinely surprised when I (a woman!) said ""f that dude"". He went on to say the typical ""*Most* stuff he says really makes sense"", ""I think all that bad stuff was taken out of context"", etc. Then a few weeks ago, he got all excited about a stand-up comedy bit he wanted to show me. Turned out to be a bit (I believe by Bill Burr, but don't quote me on it) about why women deserve to get beaten (started off with a low-effort joke about WhAt DiD rIhaNna Do To PiSs OfF cHrIs BrOwN). To which I just told him I didn't find it funny at all. 

&#x200B;

He has made other off comments about the ""alpha male"" concept and the like. I can list more examples if necessary, but these were the ones that are coming to mind right now.  


All this to say, I'm getting very worried about him. I have tried to address these occasionally. For example, I drew his attention to the stand-up, to which I got something along the lines of ""No bro, it was just a comic, don't worry about it"" and any attempt to explain why it's not ""just a comic"" for me and many others fell on deaf ears. I once even got a ""Why are you getting so triggered"" when he talked about ""alpha"" men.   


If he had been like this from the get-go, I wouldn't bother and I'd just cut him off. But I have known this man for almost a decade now, and he never exhibited any disturbing behavior (beyond the general unawareness of the non-straight-white-male experience). He is hurting, in the most depressed state he has ever been, and he's vulnerable. He's the textbook example of a potential victim of the incel ideology.

I don't want to lose my best friend over this, but I can't stay friends with someone who is nurturing misogyny in their soul. What can I do to help him see the issues I've been trying to talk about? Do you guys know any YouTubers who have a healthy, non-attacking but informative approach to this? I can sometimes struggle to get my point across, so I'm thinking maybe he'd be more likely to listen to someone who can put it more clearly and concisely.",1667222665.0,midoree,TwoXChromosomes
I(24f) keep remembering past memories of my traumatic ex (26f) despite being in a happy and healthy relationship with my bf,"i am in a very happy relationship with a loving guy for the past few months. my last relationship was very bad, we dated since highschool. it was toxic to the point i could not handle anymore, i was the one who broke up with him and i was quite happy doing so. i recently found myself remembering a few sad moments from my past relationship which affects me a lot. for eg, this one time i saw a couple fighting on the road and i immediately had flashbacks how my ex would shout at me in public and how i felt during that time. i came home, cried and felt bad for the girl as well since that was me a few years back. i broke up around this time last year. i get flashbacks how those days were and how we moved back and forth with the breakup. how he was still abusive and manipulative after the breakup, still trying to control the things i do.

i have nothing but hatred for him so no its not about missing him or good memories. its related to remembering bad memories and i realized how this will affect my current relationship. i cry because of what i currently have. a guy who loves and takes care of me. something i didnt have a year back. maybe this time, last year, i would cry myself to sleep and today after a year i go to bed happy remembering the things my bf did for me throughout the day. those bad memories are somewhat making me more grateful for what i currently have but it also makes me question myself if i deserve this love and i do not want to think or feel this way.",1707397733.0,keremiyy5,TwoXChromosomes
A friend (woman) noticed our healthy communication... and thought of it as noteworthy,"So a friend of mine was over at my partners place and my partner told me how he was not happy with something the way I di and why. So I told him why I did it that way and that I will do it different next time and said sorry.
Our friend noticed how we talked about our views and was like :""wait... something is wrong... Where is the blame?"" so he jokingly raised his voice with me to which I jokingly shouted back about being sorry and my arm still hurting. (which happened when we did some swordfighting) to which she seemed really  shocked. We looked at her and explained that we really are only joking and I explained why my arm hurt... 
Well anyway, I am now really concerned in what kind of relationships she has been if healthy communication confuses and jokingly shouting concerns her.",1706373775.0,Julesvernevienna,TwoXChromosomes
I've been in a relationship with a decent man for over 3 years and it's still blowing my mind,"I actually waited 3 years to post this because I wanted to gush about him from day 1, but decided to be prudent and wait and see and make sure. Well I'm glad I did, because a healthy relationship with an equal partner really is a gift that keeps giving.

Things about him that make him 2374982374283 times better than all my exes and any other guys I'd ever considered dating:

\* He is so thoughtful about literally every conversation we have about my emotions. He thinks, he asks questions, he validates, he is very kind and gentle, he doesn't judge, he's patient with me. He makes me feel so seen and so safe.

\* He's open to me about his emotions and isn't ashamed about being vulnerable. The first time he felt vulnerable enough to cry in front of me and say that he felt really lucky to be loved by me, that was one of the times I knew he was definitely the one for me.

\* He genuinely laughs at my jokes (even lame ones) and doesn't try to one up me.

\* Him and his friends talk about feminism related topics and talk about their female partners to each other in a really positive and loving way. (I've accidentally 'overhead' him having these conversations while gaming.) None of the old ball and chain bs. In fact, he's talked to me about hearing men complaining about their partners at work and feeling boggled about why they hate their own partner so much.

\* I sat him down and told him about all my past relationships shortly after we went official (even including the casual/less serious ones). He didn't bat an eye and just said that was all fine and I didn't need to feel pressured to tell him every single detail. I thought men generally felt very sensitive about their partner's histories so I thought honesty was the best policy. To him it was no big deal, because I am who I am today because of my past experiences, and I'm not with any of these other guys for a reason. He actually found it weird that body count were relevant to any man's preferences at all, because 'everyone's just figuring life out, you gotta try out different things, why does it matter what you've tried as long as you are getting to your destination?'

\* He told me that one of the things he loves the most about me is that I live 'with agency'. He said he was looking for someone who was confidently in charge of their own life, because that was the kind of partner he wanted to build a life with, and he found me.

\* He is so gentle and kind to his cats, and my cat also fell in love with him immediately. He spends a lot of dedicated time hanging out with them and playing with them and knows all of their personalities and preferences very well.

\* He is so cognizant of my flaws but never tries to use this information against me in a fight -- instead sometimes he gently teases me, or other times we have really serious discussions and he inspires me to be better (and he says I inspire him to be better too).

\* He was never intimidated that I am in a higher earning career than him. He said 'why would I? This is a great deal for me!'. He is ambitious in his own career but doesn't feel the need to compare. Combining finances with him was a breeze, there was no ego or anxiety, just very clear and transparent budgeting and money-related discussions (e.g. vetoing, min spend requiring discussion, shared and separate accounts etc)

\* He loves telling me about how he humble brags about me at work and how all his female bosses and colleagues like to give him advice about how to treat me well. He finds it funny when people tell him I'm out of his league and then he just tells them that's true and isn't he lucky (in reality he knows we are equally matched!).

\* He never saw housework or cooking as a 'woman's job'. In the past year I've been much busier juggling work and study, and he's seamlessly taken on 80% of housework duties (previously 50/50) and said it's no big deal because partners support each other and this is just part of teamwork. He also talked about how he wouldn't mind being a stay at home dad if I ultimately decide I'd prefer to pursue my career.

\* He never talks down to me about topics I'm less knowledgeable that he is better with (e.g. economics, tech). He always explains things patiently to me when I ask (e.g. one time he spent 4 hours explaining some stock market terms to me and seemed to enjoy it). He also listens to me when I rant about the topics I'm interested in and enjoys asking questions about them.

\* When we have disagreements, I always find that we are both working at pulling back from 'the edge' and showing each other care and tenderness to avoid falling into defensiveness or meanness. He finds it easy to say 'I love you' even when we're still a bit angry at each other. He apologises in a way that is so full-hearted and he spends time reflecting and telling me about his reflections after we've had a fight.

\* He has never ever made me feel any type of pressure about anything related to sex. He shows a lot of appreciation and tenderness towards my body. I never thought sex could be so happy and emotional and special. I just love touching him and I love the way he touches me and shows his sexual desire. Whenever I've been feeling sick or down, he doesn't even think of initiating, because he assumes that would be the furthest from my mind (so I often end up initiating in those times!).

\* I started going bra-less for comfort and asked him if it was ok with him that my nipples might look a bit pokey in my clothes. He said 'why would you need to ask me? These are your nipples, you can do whatever you like with them!'. He is supportive of me wearing whatever I want and has affectionate titles for some of my weirder outfits.

\* We have really open and refreshing chats about how to be an emotionally present parent. He reads parenting books and watches parenting videos as part of his own education for the future.

\* He likes my friends and I like his friends. He doesn't have trouble with me hanging out with any opposite gender friends and vice versa. We always share openly about where we are and what we're up to. We both have full access to each other's phones/laptops but mainly for convenience (there's never been a reason to think we have to do any kind of suspicious checking).

\* He gets along really well with my grandma, mum and sister (who are all 'difficult' in their own ways). I was always nervous that my family members would be 'too much' for a future partner, but he loves talking to them and telling me about the similarities he observed between them and me. He is so patient with my grandma who is showing signs of dementia - he always looks out for her when we're out together, and puts a lot of special effort into having a conversation with her even though she is sometimes very hard to understand and honestly quite a mean and cranky woman. I always find him laughing at her jokes and it really warms my heart. No one else outside of my family treats my grandma this kindly.

I could honestly go on and on forever...   
But I really just wanted to say -- these guys are out there. These guys genuinely like women as people and it makes a huge difference. Men who are actually strong (like actually able to be vulnerable??). Men who are actually kind. I hope all of you find relationships like this.

The biggest advice I'd give to anyone who would like to find someone like this is:

1. Watch what company they keep (if their friends are misogynists, then they probably are too, deep down)
2. Watch how they treat animals and old people

"Being celibate, single, and mostly solitary is healthy and fun, and happiness does not mean sex or relationships","I’m tired of the cultural insistence that life fulfillment means being in a relationship, and that having a  healthy relationship means having sex.

At 33 years old, I’m now living my best life, and sex and a relationship are not part of it. In fact, I spend most of my time alone, and it’s frigging wonderful. And I’m intent on continuing my current lifestyle indefinitely because it works for me. And when I want to get off, I masturbate, and it’s great.

I see a lot of people get criticized for masturbating too much. I also see a lot of people get criticized for not wanting to have sex. And I think that’s b.s.

I would way rather rub my clit than have someone do it for me. That’s like someone chewing my food for me. It actually makes the whole process more difficult, and it’s not that sexy. Our culture wants me to believe I should be turned on by the thought of having someone touch me or having sex with someone. I’m not. Nor do I want to have to spend any amount of time trying to keep up with the sexual needs or fantasies of another person. I don’t want anybody cumming on me, and I don’t need to choke on anyone’s dick, and I don’t need to have my ass torn by anybody who needs that. Nor do I need to wear my tongue out licking anybody else’s clit. Nor do I need to waste time, money, or energy working on being beautiful for anybody.

I don’t actually enjoy being advanced upon. I enjoy being able to exist in a public space without someone coming up to me to initiate a conversation. I don’t actually enjoy wearing makeup or tight fitting, uncomfortable clothing. I have spent years of my life being approached and pursued and smiling and saying yes and trying to be a sexy partner who was eager to meet the needs of their partner.

And you know what? I cut my hair short and stopped wearing makeup and started wearing guy clothes, and it’s great. Now people don’t approach me, and I can sit somewhere in public in peace and quiet and not feel obligated to engage in a polite conversation when approached. My sex life has become exactly what I want it to be – a private, fully enjoyable, painless, pleasurable experience that gets me every time, and which I can pursue precisely when I want to.

And I’m not angry anymore. I used to carry such baggage that was the result of the shitty relationship experiences I’d had and my frustration at not being able to find a relationship that was healthy and satisfying. All of that because I felt like I needed to be in a relationship. But I don’t actually want that. Because I don’t want to procreate, and I never have.

There’s no reason that the sex + relationship life should be the template that we all live our lives by. You don’t need either of those things if you’re not wanting to have children. And from what I’ve read, not wanting to have kids is a pretty common sentiment among folks in my generation.

I’m feeling really great about where I have arrived, and I’m really, truly loving my life for the first time. And I think everyone – men and women, and all other gendered and nongendered folks – should be free to live this way without having to endure criticism for it.",1622651445.0,BodilessQualia,TwoXChromosomes
A man should not legally “have a say” on whether or not a woman can get an abortion,"TW; rape

I’m so tired of hearing or seeing men say shit like “But that baby is 50% his DNA! He should have 50% of a say!”, or in some way insinuating that there should be laws that enforce a man’s say in the matter.

How do you legally enforce “a say”? Do you mean there should be written documentation showing they discussed the option? No? So you mean that a man should have the ability to prevent an abortion?

Let’s talk implementation. I would *hope* we can agree that rape victims should not have to obtain permission from their rapists in order to receive an abortion. She should not be forced to go through trial, which can be lengthy and traumatic, to *attempt* to convict a rapist and obtain her abortion. What if he can’t be convicted? Is she forced to have a baby and be a parent/pay child support etc. because her rapist wouldn’t sign off on the abortion and won’t let her put the baby up for adoption?

I struggle to even support a man *morally* having a say, not even legally. Sure, if you’re in a **serious and healthy relationship** and get knocked up, I think it’s problematic to hide the fact that you’ve gotten an abortion from them. But beyond being informed, your partner shouldn’t really have more of a say than “this is my opinion, do what’s best for you”. I loathe the thought of a woman carrying to term, and potentially being a mother, exclusively because the man wants it. We need enthusiastic parents, not coerced ones. 

And I feel like people mix up “I get to have a say” and “They have to agree with my opinion” so easily. If a woman is pregnant, the father wants her to keep it, he tells her his opinion, and she gets an abortion, that doesn’t even mean that he didn’t have a say. Just because the final outcome doesn’t align with his opinion, that doesn’t mean his opinion wasn’t *heard*. She heard it. She just didn’t agree with it, and given she’s the pregnant one, she gets a final say.

I know men like this in real life. They think they genuinely should have *just as much* of a say because he ejaculated and provided some genetic material. It drives me fucking insane.

I’m so glad my own partner is enthusiastically on board with whatever I choose. If I get pregnant right now, he has an opinion on whether or not we should become parents, but he will 100% support me with whatever outcome I choose. It’s relieving.

**NOTE: I’m using she/her pronouns for the impregnable, and he/him pronouns for the impregnators, for simplicity’s sake. Fully aware of and support the fact that trans/NB folks can get pregnant or impregnate beyond what I described with cisgendered pronouns.**

Edit: WHEW! so much interesting discourse in the comments! I think it’s pretty obvious that, when I wrote this post, I almost exclusively thinking about situations in which “man want baby, woman want abortion”. So many comments have brought up the flip side - the question of what happens if a man wants an abortion and the woman refuses - and I think it’s offered a lot of good food for thought. :)",1602869997.0,movinghelp_throw,TwoXChromosomes
Resources for what healthy friendships/relationships look like,"I'm going through it at the moment with my newly minted 16 year old. She's had a rough go of it over the past two years, running into a couple of narcissistic friends (a journey we are still working through), and her new found desire for romantic relationships. I'm finding plenty of resources that talk about bad relationships/friendships, and how to manage bad things within relationships/friendships.  


What I'm looking for though, is something that helps set expectations for what good relationships and friendships should look like. Something that focuses more on exploring the positives, than managing the negatives, if that makes sense. Does anyone have a recommendation? I'm having such a hard time with this!",1708869575.0,quackerjacks19,TwoXChromosomes
"What romance stories do you recommend for a pre-teen girl, that illustrate healthy relationships?","My daughter is 10yo, and has no practical experience with ""romance"" of any kind IRL. I think she's curious, though, and is definitely excited about the physical changes she's going through, and is looking forward to ""growing up"". 

My husband appalled me this weekend when he bought her ""Twilight"" as a gift. I was appalled that 1) he didn't know what it was, just that lots of people thought it was good; and 2) he didn't realize it was a romance (and one with very little redeeming value at that!). 

I handled the situation well, I think, but it got me thinking, too, about the romance genre. I went through a ""teen romance"" phase when I was about 12yo, and looking back, I think it was worthwhile to read those books, because it got me thinking about relationships, and what kind of boys were worth being with, and the kinds of issues that arise, and so forth. But these days I generally don't read romantic stories: offhand I can think of ""The Black Magician"", ""The Bone Doll's Twin"", ""A Man of His Word"", ""The Mirror of Her Dreams"", even ""The Tawny Man""  - but these are all primarily fantasy books, and more adult-oriented, and not primarily about the romantic relationships, so I don't think they count.

So aside from reading through the young adult section at the library and seeing which stories I think are appropriate (which I may do anyway!), maybe y'all here can offer some suggestions of books that provide that vicarious exploration of romantic relationships, how boys and girls actually relate and the problems they have, but that also illustrate healthy attitudes. I'm ok with realism, and sex (not too steamy), but my primary concern is with the underlying philosophy.
 

EDIT: Thanks for all the good suggestions! Some I've already given her, but others I never heard of. A trip to the library is in order... :)",1289241279.0,linuxlass,TwoXChromosomes
My partner doesn't understand nor care about why I need basic human rights but I SWEAR he's a good man,"I'm just saying that's how a lot of you ladies sound. 

You can date/fuck whoever you want to, it's none of my buisness but stop trying to convince others that your partner who has misogynistic ideas is a good person. It's a bit ""you don't know him like I do"", if we're being honest.

Maybe you can change him (probably not), but that's beside the point. You don't need to convince randos on the internet that you're dating a good man, we don't care. You need to think about your own choices and your own guilt towards who you engage with.",1652298677.0,matanemar,TwoXChromosomes
Anyone else getting sick and tired of women going “but he’s a good person!” After describing the terrible traits of their partner,"Just saw a post on the dating sub this morning of a woman talking about her her BF is extremely racist against women of his own race (they are an IR couple). Almost to the point he considers women of his race subhuman. They have apparently been dating 3 years and his racism continues to grow. He now has a woman of his race new to his workplace and he’s pretty much foaming at the mouth about it and losing his mind.

But then this same woman goes “but he’s a great partner! Feminist (LOL), kind, loving, good in bed, extroverted, etc.”

NO. I’m sooooo sick of women pulling this shit. I’m not trying to hold women responsible for their partners actions, but please stop trying to convince the rest of us that your racist/sexist/misogynistic bf who kicks puppies for sport is a “good person”. He may be good to YOU but that doesn’t make him a good person overall. If you want to be with that kind of man just own it. I believe you are the company that you keep btw. Chances are if you’re ok with your bf being racist, you’re probably racist yourself. Or get an ego boost from being elevated over other “subhuman” POC women.

I just hope yall who stick with these men never complain about racism/sexism/misogyny against yourselves. Can’t have your cake and eat it too.

My partner doesn’t smell good to me anymore,"I (24F) have been with my partner for 3 years now and he used to smell amazing to me. Even after he went on a long run his BO was the best thing I’d ever smelt. 6 months ago I got the arm implant and now he smells awful to me, and it’s taking a major toll on our sex life. I still love him and he’s my best friend but I have no desire to be intimate with him. I know everyone’s answer will be to take the arm implant out, but I’d really love to give it the full year since it’s helpful with some of my period symptoms. I was on the pill when we first started dating up until the implant, will he still smell bad to me when I go off birth control all together???


EDIT: Thank you all for your advice and for sharing your personal experiences, I gathered from this that messing around with hormones is no joke. I’ve made an appointment to get the implant removed and I’m going to experience being off birth control for the first time in almost 10 years.

"""If you talk to a married person, there’s a good chance it’ll come around to their partner""","One of my best friends (M, 30s) said that to me today when I asked if he had space to let me puzzle over something with him.  I needed him to keep it a secret. It involved mutual friends of ours and I wanted to know if I was getting bent out of shape over something my mutual friends did or if my feelings were valid. 

I asked him because he's one of my best friends, but he asked if he could share with his wife too. They both know this couple and I just wanted to talk to one person for perspective. His wife is also my friend. However, the more people who know the higher chance it can get back to the people I'm talking about. I want to make the choice to process first and then bring back the issue to the mutual friends to resolve if need be.  

I did say if [your wife] can also keep a secret. I just want to think something out with one person. And he said:

>If you talk to a married person, there’s a good chance it’ll come around to their partner 

Then followed it up with unless it's something like a surprise party for his wife, they tell each other everything. 

So I made a mental note to never tell him stuff I truly wanted to keep to just ONE person because anything I say to him means it's going to his wife and vice versa.  I'm now thinking back to the times I talked to his wife about bedroom problems I was having and wondering if it now means my friend knows too. If I wanted to share something with the both of them then I would. 

Do you tell your spouse everything? Is it assumed if your friends are married then whatever you say, including stuff you want to be kept to just one person, is going to get cycled to the spouse too?  

I've never been married so I'm not sure if I just missed a married people on memo, hah. Thanks for any perspectives!",1670038187.0,lehmongeloh,TwoXChromosomes
Time for 4 years of celibacy,"Ladies, get off the dating apps. No more sex. No more pregnancies. The vow of celibacy starts now. Drop your partner if they can't respect your celibacy. Keep interactions with men to a bare minimum. Ignore them online. They no longer get access to us until they can prove they're capable of caring about our basic rights, health, and safety. The “good men” failed us by letting the bad men proliferate. They all have to be punished in a way they can understand. American men need to fix their fellow men. Let them suck the poison out of each other. We have the power to shun them. We have a right to defend ourselves. Men are not safe. It's time to fight back. Let's hit them where it hurts. This is the power we have.

To the men asking in good faith what they can do to be an ally, I don't know. It's really up to you. Start a podcast or something and get more popular than Joe Rogan and the other manosphere influencers who peddle conservative-lite to suck men in and push them further right.

Found out one of my husband's friends is abusing his wife and they all rally behind him. How do you deal with that? ,"We recently found out that one of the boys in my husband's friend group (5 friends since high school so 15+ years) is extremely abusive to his wife (they also have 2 kids under 6). Here are some things we found out from his wife.

* Has been having an affair since March with a co-worker, having unprotected sex and then coming home and having sex with her. Says he's leaving her for his AP.
* Has hit her once early in the relationship and continues to have no issue physically pushing her out of the way when he storms out during a fight.
* Forced her to perform sex acts she's never done nor wanted to do in order to 'win him back'. During this he stopped halfway through tell her she's disgusting, he's not attracted to her and blames her for 'manipulating him into sex'. (because remember, he's in love with his affair partner!)
* Constantly flip flops between saying he's making a mistake and wants to be with his wife, then literally leaving to go see his AP and tell her the same thing.
* Tell her he hates her constantly, calls her disgusting, worthless and even worse things.
* Has started being mean to his 3 year old son for being a 'cry baby and a sissy'.
* drinks all night long and is doing cocaine and god knows what other drugs.
* Explicitly tells her every sexual thing he's done with his affair partner.
* Constantly promises he's going to be right back to make dinner for the kids but never returns.
* Tried to prevent the other wives in the friend group from talking to her (gee, I wonder why).
* Wife had a mis carriage at 4 months last year and told everyone ""she was different afterwards! All I want is a hot meal and blowjob after I get home from work."" Y'all. This man sells boats. HE'S A SALESMAN!
* Forced her to have anal sex (literally snuck it in DRY). She cried and said it was the worse pain she's ever felt. He tells her he still fantasizes about it. Can you imagine your partner fantasizing about causing you extreme sexual pain?

The problem is that even knowing all of this stuff, the boys in the group say ""Well he's never done anything like that to me! We've been friends for YEARS and I've never seen him do anything like that."" They said they are not ready to give up on their friend. I've always been suspicious of him, he always gave me a bad vibe and even my husband's own parents told him the same thing (SINCE HIGHSCHOOL). Over a year ago I told my husband that his friend was going to do something, do what I don't know, I just had this gut feeling. But this is so much worse than I ever thought.

I am furious. They all say what he did was not okay and they don't condone any of it and they are all super upset about it yet....they don't say any of that to their friend. They don't explicitly tell him that what he's done is fucked up and he needs help. They just act like nothing happened when he's around. My husband has been the most upset about this, he's realized he doesn't know his friend and he is not okay with what he's doing to his wife (who is a truly good-hearted person, probably why he was able to get away with it for so long) but doesn't want to let a 15+ year friendship go. Even if he did let the friendship go, the rest of the boys group aren't so what does that mean for him?

I don't know how to deal with that. How can you be friends with someone who does that to women? How can you allow him anywhere near another woman? Why are all the guys so eager to put the mask back on? I cannot un-see or un-know what I know. Who will protect women if all the men in our lives turn their backs on abuse? Where is the line to stand up for what is right? Why won't any of the men stand up for women against other men? I've lost so much respect for them and I am struggling with my husband's involvement. I can't tell my husband who to be friends with, but I can't help but feel like I'll lose some respect for him if he doesn't. How do I move on from this anger?

EDIT: I've spoken with the guys in the group, they're more worried he will kill himself if they abandon him. They're convinced he'll realize his awful mistake and realize all the awful things he's done if they call him out on it and end his life because he had a BAD childhood and very obvious mental health issues. They've only known the 'good' version and are desperate to get that image back.

Update: I called out all the guys and we had a very serious conversation. I had to divulge some pretty nasty details in order to get them to fully understand the gravity of the situation we were in. I also found out his wife wasn't the first person he abused, it's been like that since highschool and now the guys are remembering some of the crazy stories they heard and FINALLY believe them to be true. So far, I think I've made some progress but we've hit a wall. The issue is that the abuser doesn't know we KNOW, he thinks the guys only know about the affair and how he's been treating her afterwards. He doesn't know all the guys know about his awful abuse. The reason he doesn't know is the wife is scared of the retaliation she will receive if he finds out everything she told us.  So if the guys call him out for his disgusting and despicable actions, he'll know she told all their 'secrets'. The worst part of this is I'm not sure she's ready to leave fully. She still holds out hope he'll get better. I don't believe for a second she thinks she was raped, and I don't blame her for that either, abuse will fuck up your brain in unimaginable ways. As of now, none of the guys are speaking to him and luckily haven't been for days (didn't know that part). They are all trying to not lose their shit on him but not let on that they know everything. We are in a limbo until the wife decides what to do with her future. ",1721914682.0,KitKat2014,TwoXChromosomes

My partner bought a house that I can’t live in with him and I’m a little upset.,"Edit: Holy crap there are a lot of people here! I didn’t expect this amount of attention, this was really just a vent post. I should clarify some things, this is an investment property for him. He asked me beforehand if I’d like to live with him and I said that I would if there was space for my dogs. Unfortunately the house he settled on wasn’t appropriate for them so it’s okay! The house is in a high traffic and growing area, it’s not our forever home and it’s an investment property. We plan for him to buy another home in a few years (he has a very good job and I am unemployed but I have an investment property myself and I do gigs in the creative industry) to fix it up and set it up as our investment home, and then a few years after that, we will build our home together. This man is my life partner. 

I understand how this situation unfolds for different people! But this is not what I’d consider the end for us. I’m very happy moving in with my sister because it’s closer to him now than where I am currently. We are planning for the long term 🫶🏼 and I appreciate all the support and advice you all have given me! Also to the men here that are concerned at the fact that he’s paying for the house and I’m not contributing financially, this is his idea and what he wants to do. He wants to provide for me and I’m happy for that because I take care of him. We work well together! This situation is only a small hiccup in our life and I just came here to vent about it to a safe environment. Thank you sweet people! 



Edit 2 and added TLDR: aaaa I didn’t really want to elaborate on why I’ve been unemployed for 6 years but it seems to be a very heated topic of conversation. I’m a bit upset at the ferocity towards unemployed people here. This is not a sob story but I think I should clarify. I haven’t worked in 6 years because I was injured when I was in the army. I’ve been in physical therapy for about 7 years now. Mental health issues aside, I haven’t been able to work because I simply was physically not able to. I’ve made a lot of progress and for the past year and a half I’ve been looking for employment, but I’m not exactly the ideal 9-5 workhorse that employers desire. I still have twice-weekly physio appointments plus other stuff. Not a sob story, just clarification. I’ve stayed afloat due to pension benefits and my own financial investments I’ve made. 

Anyway, my two dogs are a Jack Russell and Irish Wolfhound! I live on up north with my parents. Don’t give me shit for living with them as a grown woman, they helped me a lot and in turn when my father got sick, I am looking after them now too. I am moving to my sister because she asked for help. I plan on spending some days up at my parents but paying my share at my sisters. Eldest Asian daughter things you know. 





TLDR; My partner asked me if I wanted to live with him and asked for my help finding a place for us and our two friends, I said yes only if there was adequate space for my dogs (Irish wolfhound X and Jack Russell), he ended up buying a place that didn’t have the space for us all, so I decided to not move in. 


My partner and I are getting serious and this year we had planned to move in together. We had talked about it a lot and I said to him that if we do live together in a house, I’d like to have some input too because I don’t want to just move in to his house, i want us to have a house together, something that suits both of us. We also have decided and plan to invite our two very close friends to live with us too, as we are all in a band together. I’m absolutely fine with that and I really looked forward to living with them! They’re two of my most treasured and loved friends. So this is not an issue at all. 

He agreed and said that he wants to make sure that I can live there too happily, as I have two dogs of my own. Really, all that I asked for in the house hunting was a secured back yard for the doggies because there’s no way I’m leaving them behind. If we had to move somewhere very busy (not city but packed suburbs with high traffic) i would prefer not to, but I would if the price was good (probably not because close to the city) and if it was close to the places he worked. 

We did not look for anything together before his brother found a place for him in the inner city suburbs that my partner really liked because the aesthetic of the house (I’m being generous calling it a house tbh) was black and had dark accents. It’s nice, but it made me uncomfortable because it’s very tightly packed and small and it reminds me of my barracks when I was in the military. It gave me a little pit in my chest :( I’m going to talk to my psych about this revelation actually. Anyway! 

It was in a small estate in a busy suburb right off the main road, the estate had no standalone homes, all duplex type townhouses crammed in together. It looked like an installment in a testing nuke town. Just copy paste, bland. Every house was the exact same. My partner and I have different tastes, and he quite liked the minimalism and order and style of the neighborhood. It also had no back or front yard, or front door. The back of the house was a garage, and the front was a small fenced in area (the yard) maybe 3x4 or more and the ‘front door’ was the glass door to the living area. 

He had hyped it up a lot, saying there’s a pool right next to the house and a nice big green patch for the dogs, plus the site office was going to be turned into a gym. Where the house was, was right at the start of the complex, literally number 1, and had all the mail boxes of the houses next to it. Yea they don’t have space for mail boxes for all the homes, just a huge slab of the boxes right next to the house he bought. 

The “nice big green patch for the dogs” was about the size of a pool. The house was nice, but definitely suited for working professionals with house cats. So he bought it at an eye-watering price, without looking for anything else. Literally the first house that his brother found for him (my partner is very busy and he and his brother are very close so yes, this house definitely suits my partner’s life and style but not us) 


So precovid times even a house like that, its price would have been maybe $320,000 - $450,000 and that would have been expensive. He bought it for $720,000 because he liked the black accents of the estate and house and the location and because it actually definitely suited him and his lifestyle. I’m a little shocked at his decision in many aspects. Now I’m not a property mogul or financial whiz, but holy fuck. Big dummy dumb boy. To be fair, the house is estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands more in the next few years due to the shit fuck of an economy we are in. But wow. 

So the house is 3 bedrooms, advertised as 4 but the last ‘bedroom’ has no door and is really just an upstairs living area. Lmao I hate real estate agents. So with 4 people, it’s squished. We even joked about having bunk beds and shit ahaha. So that living area is gonna be turned into a studio room with a foldout couch for guests, the boys are gonna put in a wall and door. 

Where am I in all of this? I’m not going to be living with them. I’ve decided to move in with my sister, as her roommate is moving out and her place has a huge yard, 4 bedrooms, two living areas and I can have my own bathroom and bathtub *cries happily* 

I’ll be closer to the city than where I am living now (about an hour and a half to my partners current place with his brother) plus there’s more opportunities for jobs than my sleepy seaside town. I haven’t worked a job in 6 years because I’ve been in physio from injuries in the army so I’m a bit nervous but excited to start living again!!! Plus I’m really keen to live with my sister and grow closer again. 

Anyway I’ve done ALOT of yapping and venting sorry, realizing now I should go back to therapy as it seems I have a lot on my chest. Funny how many realizations I’ve made in this one post! But really I’m disappointed in my partners choices, but I’ve also found a silver lining and that is the fact that I’m starting my life again after recovering at my parents for a long time! 

So I’m not planning on breaking up with my partner but I am becoming more independent as a result of this. All in all, not so bad but I just wanted to have a little vent in a safe space. ",1720850049.0,RareWolf34,TwoXChromosomes
My boyfriend of 5 years just told me he no longer finds me desirable because I lost an eye.,"My partner/boyfriend (M, 50s) of 5 years just told me (F, 40s) he no longer finds me attractive since my brain surgery that caused me to lose one eye. So he has gotten a mistress in her 20s for sex. 

I have an eyepatch now and probably will for the rest of my life. But really?!!!! 

I’m not even sure what to do with this.

I’m still recovering so can’t quite leave yet (we live together). But I’m just in shock.

Besides the 10 pounds I gained and the eye patch. I look the same as I did when we started dating.

I’m a former model but I wasn’t when we met. I did my best to find a man that I thought wasn’t with me solely for my looks (cause I knew one day they would go). 

The irony is I stood with  him through chemo. He lost his hair and then he gained 25 pounds and I still made sure he felt desirable. 

Im mad at myself for letting this put me in a deep depression. My surgery was a two months ago.Strangers still compliment me on my looks.. I graciously say thank you and move on. So I still believe at least one man will still find me attractive with an eyepatch.

But I just feel awful cause this one person who Ive shared my life with looks at me with disgust. So I cry and then I get mad at myself for crying.

I keep thinking he is crazy but that doesn’t stop the tears. 

So I guess I’m just asking for encouragement from people who are on the other side of leaving an unappreciative partner and now with a good one. And really any encouragement.

I know I’ll get to the other side. But right now this stinks.

Is every man's attraction to their partner so fickle?,"When I love someone, I find them attractive. I don't wish for someone with a bigger penis. I don't wish for them to have huge muscles or abs. Normal body changes don't bother me or turn me off.

My current boyfriend is not the same. Hell, many of the men from my past. So many idiots who expect you to have the perfect tits and ass, never have any weight fluctuations or signs of aging because then they won't want to fuck you as much 🙄

When I met my boyfriend, he seemed to really like how I looked and liked my body. Then suddenly when we made it official, he had gripes about my body. I was too overweight apparently. My boobs too small. ""Frumpy, peach shaped body"" is what he said. He liked my ""big mom butt"" but ya, my weight was an issue for him.

Since April, I have lost nearly 30 pounds. Most of it lost in only a couple months. Apparently that's not great either! Now he comments on my loose skin, how my boobs are even smaller and saggier, he told me the other day I need to start doing squats because my butt isn't as good as it used to be.

I feel like shit about myself. I always wanted to lose weight, and I definitely look better in clothes now, but he's right, my tits and ass used to be good at least and look terrible now. I look worse naked than I used to.

But regardless, I can't win with him, unless I have a 20 year old porn stars body. But I'm a mom in my 30's and my body shows it.

I'm worried most men are like this. That anyone i end up with will think this way. Maybe they won't be as forward about it but I feel like any man will wish I had a flat stomach, bigger and better boobs and butt. Like the best I can hope for is a man who feels that way but at least has the decency to keep it to himself.

It’s my final straw,"I cannot sleep at night, I haven’t had a peaceful sleep in almost 6 years because of my husband’s snoring. I love him so much but he does not take care of himself. He has really good insurance through his work yet he doesn’t have a practitioner her goes to get regular check ups or to look into why he snores so loud. He constantly complains about being dead tired all the time, but he never listens to me. It’s directly tied to his snoring, he himself isn’t getting good sleep because of his atrocious snoring. All night every night I wake up off and on to move him, adjust him, kick him with my feet, poke him in the back, start crying because none of it works anymore. We now sleep in a king bed, I’m on the way edge to get away from the snoring but you can literally hear it through the walls and upstairs through the floor. He doesn’t want to go to the doctors about it because he scares himself with all the “what if’s”. He gets mad at me now, and it really sucks because I’m the one not sleeping. He just sleeps away without a care in the world, while in the meantime I’m doing whatever I can to shut out the noise and sleep. Even when he’s taking a nap and starts snoring it’s like nails on a chalkboard for me. It goes all the way up my spine and I can’t even be around it anymore. The one thing I told myself to be patient about but it’s almost been 6 years. I don’t want to be resentful but it’s starting to creep up my throat every time I can’t sleep. I know a lot of you probably deal with a snoring partner, if anyone has any advice please share it. He tried nasal strips but it didn’t work at all. He’s a mix of Asian decent and has a small nose and I think that’s the main issue, but he doesn’t want to go on a sleep machine, At this point I don’t care what he has to go through so I can have a peaceful night of sleep next to him.

Just spent three hours on dinner and he’s too tired to eat it. ,"My (32) boyfriend (40) went out to play dnd and watch mma with his buddies tonight. He usually gets home between 11pm-1am when he does this. I love cooking so all day while I was at work I was thinking up this really nice dinner I could make while he was gone and, while not incredibly intricate, is was a time consuming process and it took me about three hours. I wanted to take advantage because we don’t have his daughter (4) tonight and I typically have to make something that’s very quick and basic so we can get her to bed at a decent hour. I was talking up this dinner and my plans a lot before he left. He expressed excitement. But when he came home he started talking right away about how tired he was because of the kind of weed he smoked? Wouldn’t even tell me about the fights or his evening in general. Was too tired for dinner. So I boxed everything away. It’s there to eat tomorrow but it isn’t the same. It got me thinking, when has he ever spent three hours doing something for me? I cook every meal. And I  genuinely love cooking, but I also grocery shop and do at least 80% of the house work and I help care for his daughter. I consider her a step daughter and he considers me her step mom but he’s made it clear he’ll never marry me. My feelings are hurt, again. I’m all over the place right now. He’s never even given me an orgasm in three years. I feel so fucking low right now like I don’t matter at all. 

Edit: I do appreciate everyone’s perspectives on this, except when it comes to my boyfriend being a deadbeat or someone who deserved to be left by his daughter’s mother. While I’m evaluating right now whether he’s a good partner to me, he is a very good father. And while I know many people like to use the narrative that their ex is just crazy… I have seen first hand that she is hostile and abusive, and their split was about him wanting to protect his daughter. We do the best we can together to offset whatever she goes through with her mother because the court decided for the time that custody should be split 50/50. But thank you all for your perspectives aside from that, I’ve replied to some and I’ll probably reply to more but for the most part it’s so kind of everyone to offer their input and empathy and I really do appreciate it.",1728195063.0,Maromie,TwoXChromosomes
I can't believe there's talk about no fault divorce going away in the U.S.,"Edit: I'm adding this as context upfront because it keeps coming up in the comments and some people obviously haven't been in contact with divorce proceedings enough to understand this... YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TYPE OF DIVORCE YOU WANT TO PURSUE WHEN YOU INSTIGATE A DIVORCE! I could have done a fault divorce in both of my divorces but chose not to because no fault divorces are cheaper, easier, faster, and don't involve actually going to court. In the case of my first marriage where abuse was involved, it was also SAFER to do a no fault divorce. Me choosing to do no fault divorces despite having the capacity to do fault divorces further proves my point that no fault divorces are not only needed but WANTED, so don't come at me in the comments like I'm undermining my own point because I am not

------- original unaltered post below -------

It's been heavy on my mind because I've been separated for several months now and we got our stipulation sorted out and filed. We are in our state's waiting period now, so this clearly is on my mind a lot.

I've done a no fault divorce once before this too. My first marriage he was abusive in every way, emotionally, financially, sexually, physically, etc so of course I divorced him. This second marriage is ending because he cheated (I know, I know, I have terrible taste in men).

But I seriously cannot FATHOM why anyone would seek to abolish no fault divorce. These things happen to men too. It doesn't do ANYONE any good to trap people in marriages they don't want to be a part of. What do they think they will accomplish with abolishing no fault divorce? I don't understand it at all! 

As if becoming divorced twice over for the worst reasons wasn't enough by itself to make me never want to remarry, they're now taking away the most civil and easy way to divorce? Yeah, no thanks. I don't want to be trapped in a marriage and exploited for the rest of my life. That's all marriage has ever been for me after all, it's just a way for my partners to exploit me. They feel like they have me ""secured"" once we take the husband and wife titles and then they are surprised when I don't hesitate to leave due to their disrespect and abuse. NEWS FLASH - marriages are only permanent when both partners want to stay married! Even when there wasn't no fault divorce it didn't stop spouses from running off and abandoning their partner and sometimes even children.

And before anyone has a chance to comment about me ""exploiting"" these men in anyway, I DID NOT take alimony and I have no children. There is no financial support/gold digging going on. Neither of these men owe me anything. I married for love and they USED MY LOVE for them against me. That's the bottom line here.

And even if you think this somehow benefits men, imagine being stuck with a wife who is abusive or manipulative. Imagine being stuck in a sexless marriage. Imagine being stuck with someone you grow to hate and resent. How does that do anyone any good?  ",1716604883.0,MischievousHex,TwoXChromosomes
"It isn't our job as a woman to teach grown ""men"" basic hygiene. And I'm so tired of them thinking it is.","I don't know about anybody else, but the amount of mem who think it's  our job to show them how to clean themselves, or even worse, clean them ourselves, is just awful  and disgusting. 

I was reading yet another post about a young woman talking about how she went to give her bf head, but when she got closer to his penis it smelled so bad it made her gag. 
And in roll the man-children  comments telling her to take a shower with him and either ""show  him how to wash it"" or ""wash it for him"". 

Like WTF!!! Why is it her job to do that? And why are they even suggesting that?? Why can't  men wash their own nasty junk? Good lord. Made me so irritated. I have NEVER in my life expected my partner to wash my vagina for me. I have also never had to have a partner show me how to wash it. I can't  even imagine thinking that somehow it should be something  he needs to do. 


And this is just another form of incompetence on the male side. Just another thing they want us to do for them that they should already know, or could learn on their own.  But don't  want to. 

It's  not our job to make sure you have basic hygiene habits or to  help you develop them. And stop expecting us to. If you're old enough to bathe by yourself, your old enough to clean yourself and to know how to do that.

My sister showed me how I don't want to live as a women.,"She is probably the biggest example in my life of how bad it is to follow all the expectaitions that gets layed on us as women.

I don't want to sound mean, I love her but I had such a big light bulb moment that she fell in the trap of a misogonistic life. 

Objectively everything is perfect, she did everything expected from her. Married in her mid twenties to her highschool sweetheart, built a house, two beautiful children, career driven and the money is good, I guess as an outstander the grass on the other side seems very green. But she is miserable.

I love my BIL, but I can see how hard it is with him as a husband. Just a bare minimum man, who sometimes bitches around and sometimes gets a little manipulative. I am sure they don't really love each other. 

She is career driven and leaves in the early hours and comes home pretty late. Homework with children after that. Grandma has the children most of the time, cleans and cooks for them. I can't describe how often I babysat. I saw her having multiple breakdowns, but she refuses to do things differently ""because of the children"". She had a small stroke before even turning 40. 

And yet she speaks about how wonderful it is to have children a day after they screamed at each other and she cried they worn her down so much that she does not feel happyness anymore. 

Fuck that. I had these dreams too, being told to be smart, love a partner, be beautiful, independent but easy going, children are a must have of course. A mediocre partner can destroy your life. Children make things harder. Buying a house can trap you. The risk of it all going down and getting put on women is high.

I am sure she would be another person on her own.

The last name debate with my partner,"Me and my partner are planning for having a baby (one and done) and while he is one of the truly good ones, we have come across an unexpected issue about the naming ""system"" when it comes to marriage and building a family. 

I have a lot of issues with the patriarchal naming system in general. We do plan to get married sometime soon but I will not be giving up my last name which is a huge part of my identity as well as my career. I am in my mid 30s and have a very rare last name that will likely die out in a few generations. I wish to hold on to that if I marry, no matter what. 

The issue is that if we would have a child together, married or not, he strongly wishes for the child to be given his last name. As for me I believe it should be my name. We live in Sweden where a child automatically gets the mother's surname (if the parent's aren't married) and I believe this logic makes a lot of sense for reasons we all are too familiar with regarding parenting plus my personal egoistical wish with carrying on this rare name. 

We can talk about all this calmly and reasonably with him and while we share very similar views about feminism, equality etc, it is this topic that he is not willing to bend on at all. What makes it problematic for me is that he doesn't really have many valid reasons besides ""this is how it has always been"" and that he wishes to be included at least somehow on a formal level such as the name. 

Honestly, I feel like it will be a battle none of us can win. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Even if not, I'd love to hear your thoughts about that topic.",1733837195.0,dimanche101,TwoXChromosomes
He told me THE reason he was voting split ticket this U.S. election cycle.,"We've been dating for a few years. It's difficult for him to open up, and he is allergic to conflict (yet strangely, not commitment.) We are on the same page on basically everything in life, or so I thought.

I am not pleased with either political offering, but one is very clearly better than the other. So I jokingly asked if he was ""excited"" (very sarcistically) to vote for Kamala Harris, since he said he got his ballot in the mail. He sighed and said he was glad that he didn't have to vote for Trump, but that he'd still be voting split ticket. My heart skipped a beat and I asked, ""what do you mean."" Abortion is in the ballot. What?

And then he tried to explain to me what voting a split ticket *is* and I cut him off, saying I know what the fuck it is ---*why* the fuck are you doing that? Because in July before Biden dropped out of the race, I had a mini-panic attack about the state of things and surviving a second Trump presidency. He sat with me for about 2 hours as I bubblered on about how scared I am for myself and *every other decent human being on the planet,* because unfortunately, the U.S. is a political powerhouse and what happens here *deeply* affects other countries. At the time he calmed me down and asked if there was anything he could do to help, we talked at length, etc.

So when I asked him if saying he was voting split ticket was supposed to be a joke...and I asked why. He said:

>**the only reason I am voting for Kamala Harris is because I don't currently make enough money to make voting for Trump worth it.**

I am CIS female, and white passing--but he's a visibile minority. The Republicans *will* come for Loving, and then we could never get married. I have trans friends and family members. He has been in relationships *with* trans women. What about them? Etc. And he thought about it for a while before saying, ""I never claimed to be a good person, I tell you all the time what an awful person I am. I am inheriently selfish. And when presented with the lesser of two evils or the greater good, I will always vote for what benefits me the most, and what benefits others second."" With the only occasional (not even always, just *occasional*) exception being climate change. This is a man who dates trans women. But he doesn't want them (or apparently anyone else????) to have a leg to stand on?

He makes 6 figures. I have never made 6 figures. I have had to take advantage of those social welfare systems the Republican party wants to destroy. I am a minority that they would rather do away with, even if I pass whiteness on the visual scale. I asked him, if I could prove to him that a direct vote for any Republican is condemning both of us, if it would change his mind. He said no because eventually he's going to be making so much money that he will vote for whatever keeps him from having to pay taxes. Eventually he will make so much money that he'll be one of the ""exceptions"" for the laws. And that his vote ensures that he can take care of whatever I need, too. This made me very angry. Because as I told him, ""cool, you'll have enough money to take care of just me. What about everyone else? What the fuck are my rights to existence if you die? My quality of life will be predicated on *your* income because *you* voted to have the systems that way? You don't see the problem with this?"" And he looked sheepish but basically shrugged in a way that told me, ""*yeah, I guess those are the facts.""*

I told him, very plainly, that typically people who make selfish decisions like that, especially when people they supposedly love and care about say, ""your vote is actively going to hurt me"", typically do *not* care about their partners. I asked him if he could even imagine a circumstance where he picked my needs before his own, since he had said that thing about selfishness. He gave me two examples of times he genuinely was selfless towards, but outside of me he has never done a selfless act.........dude. *This* is your moral compass?

I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""thank you for being honest. That takes a lot of courage to do."" And then I told him that I loved him, but I needed to go home.

This was someone I was supposed to move in with before the end of the year. I'm in a stable, but not-so-great home situation at the moment that I was looking forward to getting out of. I don't want to be in a relationship just to put a roof over my head, but I have barely been able to sleep since he told me this. I don't want to break up with him but it just feels like a fundamental difference that I have no idea if I can get over. I'm not interested in trying to change his mind. I just wish I understood how he could sit through my emotional melt downs every other time for hours and literally never complain about it and be a good partner in literally every other way....until this conversation.

I'm not asking how to repair this relationship, I'm asking what the fuck I am supposed to do when the guy who has treated me the best out of any relationship in my entire life (my THERAPIST fucking approved this guy) is *also* like this, when it *really really reallllllyyy* matters. What the fuck do I even do now. 

  
**editing for multiple points of clarity:**  



>  
Why didn't you believe him when he called himself selfish? 

Because this was over things like ""hey I ate the last of the leftovers"" or ""I forgot to do that thing you asked me to do because I was excited about XYZ."" Things *every actually reasonable human being has a jokingly said they are selfish for doing* ***not*** *for a difference in human rights.* Asking someone to read into every innocuous comment when their partner has had no red flags up to that point is something.   


>Why are you still with him? 

Never said I was! I was asking for clarification on how to avoid men who spend entire years with the mask up, but this is continously being glossed over and people are assuming I'm staying with him. I'm not. I am lamenting the time wasted on someone who was acting like they gave a shit and asking what the fuck else I am supposed to do when even my therapist thinks he's okay enough for me to trust. 



>Your therapist shouldn't be ""approving people"" 

  
All I meant by this comment was that I've been working with my therapist for many years, and that we both agree that this *was* (emphasis on the past tense here) a healthy relationship in comparison to everything else, and that I had been doing a good job using my skills that I learned in therapy to navigate this relationship.

I hate my boyfriend and I hate feeling this way,"EDIT.

Thanks to everyone who read and commented. I didn't expect so many people to read this; it's terribly long.

A lot of you are being very encouraging and understanding. Thank you for that. 

Many of you are asking why? Why am I even with this asshole? Why have I put up with it for so long? I should know this is all unacceptable, should've dumped him long ago, and so on. 

I think this is something a lot of people deal with when in bad relationships. Things don't necessarily start off bad. In my own case, things started off great. After he moved in, there were annoyances here and there, but at the time I chalked it up to being due to the adjustments having to be made living with a new person. Living with another person is tough. So I thought many of the inconveniences would dissipate over time. 

Things gradually progressed until they became identifiable patterns. My exhaustion grew; my unhappiness increased. Over time, I found myself getting upset and annoyed in his presence. I could feel my blood pressure rise when he walked into the room. 

At first I asked myself what it was I could do to change things. To make them better. I asked myself if I was the problem. 

Things were allowed to get to this point because it's not always obvious what the source of the problem is. 

I typed this all out and posted it because it was therapeutic on some level. I also needed feedback from others to make sure I wasn't crazy. I needed to make sure none of this was normal. (Now I know a few of you will jump on that statement and tell me I should KNOW none of it is normal. It's hard to untangle feelings from logic from memories from manipulation. Having to pick it all apart can be confusing.)

I \*did\* break up with him, after bringing up these issues multiple times. And of course, he claimed he only had good intentions. I was misinterpreting everything. 

As a quick UPDATE to the situation:

I broke up with him a few days ago. Since then, he's been avoiding being home. He only comes home at night to go to sleep. He has not harassed me for sex for the past two nights. He and I had a ""conversation"" last night, at his insistence. Apparently, he is doordashing for extra money (as of yesterday) and believes this is all just a big misunderstanding. A hiccup in our relationship. He also believes that there is ""someone else,"" that I dumped him because I'm interested in another man/talking to another man. This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not sure if it's getting through to him that I'm unhappy because of our relationship, not because I want to run off with someone else. It seems easier for him to blame some nameless, faceless ""other man,"" rather than take responsibility. 

Again, thank you everyone who has read and commented on this post.

My boyfriend moved into my house a little over a year ago (previously, we had a great relationship). Since then I've grown to absolutely hate him. I feel on edge, stressed out, agitated, ready to retreat, angry, and uncomfortable whenever I see him or when I'm in the same room as him.

I have spent the past few months trying to figure out why. Initially I blamed myself (maybe I've suddenly become a miserable and crotchety person?), but I believe I have a multitude of reasons for feeling the way I feel.

Here, in no particular order, are the reasons I hate my boyfriend:

Reason # 1

Up until only the past month or so, but only after I repeatedly had to lose my everloving shit on him to finally get him to listen and acknowledge my discomfort, he would constantly (4-7x/week for about a year) nag, beg, coerce, guilt and shame me for sex. Every.Single.Night...as soon as I would go to the bedroom at night to go to bed, he would immediately start grabbing and ripping my clothes off, while demanding sex. He would aggressively paw at me in the most unappealing way imaginable. (And the thing is, I love sex. If my body doesn't feel completely destroyed from a long, work-filled day, I usually want to have sex.) And I would recoil because oftentimes the yanking and grabbing and tearing my clothes off was really uncomfortable, and in a few cases, painful. In fact, he pulled something in my back from grabbing me by the shoulders and yanking me around while trying to forcefully take my clothes off. It took months to heal.

So when I would cringe and try to physically distance myself from him (because I would feel overwhelmed and bombarded), he would immediately begin with the nagging. ""Oh, so I guess we're not fucking tonight? Why don't you want to fuck me? Why? Tell me why? Why don't you want to have sex?"" At this point I would be so turned off, I would decide (even if I originally wanted to have sex) that I would prefer to engage in any activity BUT sex with him. So I would tell him ""no, I guess we're not having sex tonight."" Then he'd ask ""why?"" ""Why? Why? Why? Why?"" I would tell him I simply wasn't in the mood (which was true, because I'd lose the desire to have sex after being manhandled and then asked in a weird, almost accusatory, nagging way if we weren't fucking.)

Then more ""why's"" would follow. Then he'd keep going. Nagging. Begging. Telling me if I didn't fuck him, his entire next day would be ruined. He'd tell me he didn't believe I wasn't in the mood, and would demand to know the ""real"" reason why. He'd accuse me of wanting other men. Etc., etc. THIS would happen during the majority of nights out of a week. I would oftentimes just give him what he wanted, just so I could get some peace and quiet. If I didn't give him what he wanted, the nagging and harassing would go on for HOURS. I would look at my phone occasionally. 11pm. 12am. 1am. And every time I would feel devastated, knowing I had to be up early in the morning, and knowing that I would feel like garbage due to being kept up so late, all because he demanded to know WHY I wouldn't have sex with him.

On a few occasions, he would throw temper tantrums and stomp around and tell me he was leaving the house.

What was once a love for sex (on my end; always loved it), became having sex just to get him to leave me alone and let me finally sleep at night.

I've never in my life experienced this sort of behavior surrounding sex, and I've never in my life been so turned off by someone. Over time, I grew to resent him, mainly because he ruined the joy I always found in having sex with a partner, and also because my sleep and restfulness had suddenly taken a nosedive. My days became more exhausting, more unbearable, more tiring (and I'm an extremely busy person, with a mountain of responsibilities; I cannot afford to not get proper rest).

After a few months of this, I had started to feel stressed out before bedtime. I would hesitate to go up to the bedroom to go to sleep, because he would LITERALLY sit next to me on the couch and WAIT for me to begin walking upstairs so that he could run up and follow me and start his bullshit with the demanding and nagging for sex. It became a conundrum for me: I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed, so I want to go to bed, but I also know if I go up to bed, I won't be getting any sleep.

&#x200B;

Reason # 2

When he moved in, I realized that the rent he was paying at his old place was half the amount I pay at my place. And I didn't want to break him financially, so the agreement was for him to pay what comes out to 1/3 of the rent here. And that's perfectly fine by me.

That being said........

Only up until this past month, he has not bought any groceries for the house BUT he eats an insane amount of food. Oftentimes, while he's drunk/drinking, he gets the booze munchies and rips through the cabinets and refrigerator. A lot of times I would come downstairs in the morning, begin making coffee, etc., and find a bunch of empty food containers, packages, bags, boxes, etc. of brand new stuff I had just bought that was meant to last at least for the week (until my next shopping trip), but was now gone.

What's worse is that at no point did he ever think in his head ""wow, I just ate all of (insert food item), maybe I should go to the store and pick some more up so that my partner can have some."" No. Not at all. Never. The first time I brought up my frustration with the matter (in the very beginning), he was like ""oh, you told me I could help myself to whatever I wanted to eat? So what's the problem?""

I was like...""yeah, but I assumed you would help yourself while keeping me in mind. Like I buy this stuff because I also want to eat it. I don't think someone should have to tell you to have some consideration and leave some for me?""

He acted like he had no clue he wasn't supposed to just eat everything all the time and contribute nothing to the weekly groceries or replace anything. Now, whenever I (very politely, mind you) ask him to leave some food for me (usually when I see him drunkenly rip open a package and begin inhaling the items within), he gets defensive, as if I'm being mean. I just want to eat some of the stuff I buy for the house.

Additionally, he doesn't offer to help pay oil, electric, or anything else. I've brought this up - how it doesn't feel like a partnership because he doesn't even ask if I need help paying utilities. He reminded me that the agreement was the amount he's currently paying towards rent (which by the way amounts to $400/month. He's paying $100 a week to live in a house, eat for free, all utilities included).

&#x200B;

Reason # 3

I guess this goes along with Reason # 2, but he always complains that he is broke. He doesn't make enough money. He has no money. He complains about money constantly. So when we go out, I always feel bad, because it seems like he somehow mentions how broke he is conveniently before we go out to dinner or do things together. So I feel almost obligated to pay. I feel guilty making my ""broke"" boyfriend pay for anything. But I know that's on me. That's a decision I'm making.

What pisses me off, is that in spite of how ""broke"" he is (he will often not have the money to pay his part of rent; he'll pay it late, or break it up into multiple payments throughout the month), he buys alcohol every night (with the exception of a random night here and there), go out to drink, AND for a while there, he was getting Amazon packages multiple times per week. He could afford to order a bunch of stuff for himself every week. But he can't ask me if I need help paying the electric bill.

&#x200B;

Reason # 4

He's clingy and....I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to describe reason # 4, but....he's always up my ass. If I get up to move from one room to the next, or if we're sitting next to each other on the couch and I get up to go upstairs, he demands to know where I'm going and what I'm doing and then proceeds to ask ""why, why, why."" He does so in a very accusatory tone. There's this unsettling sound of urgency in his voice. All I'm doing is going upstairs to get something from the bathroom? Like no matter what I do or where I go in the house, he has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going and for what reason. I feel like I can't do anything without giving an explanation and it's exhausting.

I don't typically go out anywhere (besides work and to shop for groceries and household essentials), but the few times I've begun to leave the house (while of course telling him I had to run out really quick), without giving him a full-blown explanation of where I'm going and for what, he's acted like I was going out to...I don't know what....go to an orgy? The one time, I had to run to Target, and he demanded to know for what, wanted to know what was on my list. I was so exhausted from being followed around and harangued, I snapped at him...because who has time to tell someone their entire shopping list?

BUT THEN, he goes out and I don't bother him about it. I don't demand to know details, who, where, why. He actually goes out-out. Like to bars and to hang out with friends. I don't try to stop him. I don't ask him what he's doing. I don't bother him via text while he's out.

I typically use the nights where he's out as an opportunity to go to bed early, and without being harassed. And surprise, surprise...when he comes stumbling through the door late at night, he ALWAYS shakes me awake and demands sex. Sometimes he wakes me up and accuses me of talking to other men while he was away, and it turns into this big thing and I don't get that extra sleep I had so badly needed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are actually some more major reasons, but I'm now realizing how long this post is.

I told him I no longer wanted to be with him. I don't know how that's going to go, because he lives here now, and I know he can't afford to move out. Of course, he's upset. He tells me everything he does comes from a good place. He has good intentions. With the sex, he says it's not as bad as I make it out to be, or that it's not as often as I claim it is. That's not true. I know how often and how bad it's been. Perhaps the fact that he drinks skews his memory? He claims he only asks me a million questions because he's ""trying to start a conversation."" He only follows me around ""because he loves being around me."" In his mind, he's being a saint. And I'm just misunderstanding him.

So of course, I keep going back and forth. Do I dump him? Stay with him? Am I the bad guy?

I've really been thinking about this. I haven't seen him all day, as he seems to be avoiding me and avoiding being at the house (for the last two days.) I feel more calm and peaceful than I have in over a year.

I have to listen to the way I feel around him, which is straight up trash.

Has anyone else had to completely sacrifice their sleep for their partners comfort?,"First off we don't have kids and never plan to so this isn't a ""baby is keeping me up"" situation. Apologies for the rant incoming. My sister had near identical issues with her ex husband so I want to know if this is a trend that a lot of women have to put up with?

I work shift, 12 hours, day or night on a 4 week rotation. I need sleep to function at my best particularly towards the end of the shift. He works a regular office job with flexible hours, he usually works from home and I'm always on site.

Unfortunately I'm a very light sleeper so my partner waking me sometimes can't be helped and I understand that. But I don't understand why he can't make a few small changes to stop constantly waking me up.

He doesn't come up to bed until 3 to 5 am (on day shifts I get up at 6am) once he comes to bed I will not be able to fall back asleep so for example if he comes to bed at 3 I will be awake starring at the ceiling until 6 and I get up for work, his argument is that I get uninterrupted sleep before that so I should be fine, a whole 4 hours on average assuming I sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow.... even when he does come to bed he does this hop on thing that shakes the whole bed, he'll be slurping away on a drink of milk or something and make this lip smacking noise I hate and also be reading comics or playing games on his tablet that cause the room to light up like the 4th of July. I've asked him to please finish his drink downstairs and not come to bed until he's finished reading/gaming (I'd prefer if he just came to bed with me so I'm not half awake all night waiting to be woken up) but he says he needs to do it in bed as part of his ""wind down routine"".

As a compromise I've suggested that I sleep on the couch and he takes the bed when I'm on the day shift, but he says that doesn't work because he doesn't want to be kicked out of the living room so early, usually 11pm, so I said okay you take the living room and I take the bed, no that won't work either because he needs to sleep on the bed to get ""proper sleep"" despite the fact that he'll nap for hours on the couch in the afternoon and evening and snores like a chainsaw so I also can't use the living room to watch stuff or play the PlayStation (my main hobby and stress relief) I've said maybe skip the evening nap so he can come to bed at the same time as me but he doesn't like ""going to bed early because the day is over then""

I've tried sleep masks for the lights and I have headphones that I sleep with but nothing blocks him out, he snores regularly but denies it despite the dozens of recordings I've played him or he says they're not actually that loud. He snores less in some positions but doesn't find them as comfortable so he won't sleep like that. 

I'm 100% sure that his snoring is tied to his weight gain which he denies is a thing, I don't mind the weight at all just the snoring but he refused to work on that unless we join this very expensive gym together (we live next to a lovely big park perfect for jogging) as he wants it to be a joint activity and the gym has a pool (I don't like being in a pool)I have chronic hip pain and can't strain it since my operation, I'm also 5'2"" he's 6'3"" with long legs and no mobility issues, ignoring the money and fitness level difference I prefer to work out by myself anyway.

Another suggestion I've made is to get a camper bed or something that I can set up in our storage room and put away when I'm done so he can have the run of the living and bedroom but he acts like a kicked puppy saying that's sounds like what divorcing couples do and he thinks it'll spell the end of our relationship. 

What the hell can I do then? I just want one night a week that I can get a solid 8 hours without feeling like an asshole about it. Am I actually being unreasonable about this? He was gone for a work event overnight a few weeks ago and I went to bed early and woke up late for the first time in years and I felt so amazing! I just want to feel rested again.

Is this a thing that happens to other women? It's so frustrating because he's usually fairly considerate with other stuff but this is actually affecting my work, health and happiness so much and he can't seem to meet me halfway or if he does do something like sleep on the couch he complain about it all day and ask passive aggressively if I had a good night's sleep.",1706688878.0,Mikki-chan,TwoXChromosomes
"My partner wants my child and I to leave him alone, preferably out of the house, for an entire day every week. It's 'the only way he can regenerate and be present for us the rest of the week.'","I think this is a ridiculous request for a man who claims to want to be part of our family. He insinuates that this is the only reason he isn't currently present and active in our lives and household regularly.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight and responses. Many of you are correct, he is definitely an introvert and could use some mental health care, but he hasn't wanted to seek out help. I will keep trying, and we are hopefully trying couples counselling soon. 
He and my daughter have a good relationship, more as friends than parent-child but she's older and also has her bio dad so I wouldn't expect otherwise. He's not a bad guy simply because he wants time alone, this post has definitely been a bit of a vent for me, and I understand that not just men need this. But from my perspective he already gets a ton of alone time so I have trouble understanding. I really appreciate your perspectives and advice. ☺️",1699807641.0,MrsWigglebottom,TwoXChromosomes
Turns out my bf is anti choice (prolife),"I (34f) had a difficult conversation with my bf (37m) last night. First of all he had no idea any of the Supreme Court stuff was going on. When I tried my best to explain it he said abortion should be illegal. I asked a few prodding questions like what about rape? Incest? Medical necessity? ""Well obviously that would be okay. But if you do it just because you don't want a kid then it's wrong. Like if you aborted my baby for no reason I'd have to kill you, ya know?"" I was flabbergasted, to clarify it wasn't like a threat, I'd like to think it was more to emphasize his point. I asked what about if a guy get a girl pregnant then abandons her? ""He didn't force her to have sex with him then she has to have the baby"" also something to the effect of that hardly ever happens (he has a good group of friends that have actually stepped up as dads so maybe that's just his perspective) I said but if it's my body it should be my choice, his response was ""once you're pregnant it's not just your body anymore"". I guess I'm just processing it all. I've always known we had different views on things. We're probably opposite sides of the political spectrum and I've been able to overlook it for the most part because he's a good guy but I'm not sure I can get over this one. I've had two abortions that he wouldn't agree with (before I met him) and I didn't have the heart to tell him about it. I don't think he would've listened anyway. Thanks for providing a place where I can get this off my chest and process it out in writing. We've been together almost 13 years but idk if I can do it much longer.",1651765978.0,Rousandscrabmles,TwoXChromosomes
I do not want to take care of a man,"I (30 F) am currently single, but have been dating a guy (30 M) for a few months. I like him a lot, and I think that we're really compatible. There are lots and lots of pros, but one huge con that I just can't shake is that I truly think, if left to his own devices, he would let me do *everything* domestic. 

Of course, I don't live with him yet, but in just the few months we've been dating, I've realized that I truly I think he would let me do *everything*. He has cooked for me in the past, but it's usually just a few things that he can throw on the grill. There's no real prep or clean-up, which is fine with me, but last night, I made a beautiful meal and he just... sat there. He didn't offer to help, he didn't offer to help clean up, he didn't even help me find things (I was cooking at *his* place, btw) I needed like knives and cutting boards. He did lay the table, which was nice, but then went and sat right down. I had to call him over to get him to serve himself, because otherwise he would have let me wait on him, and that wasn't fucking happening.

This is a fully grown man, in HIS house, letting me *serve* him. He's also not particularly clean, but he makes good money so he has a cleaner come in and clean his place. But I've never used a toilet after the man without accidentally stepping in piss. Before bed last night, he wanted to just leave everything in the kitchen and ""deal with it in the morning"" despite the fact that there was food left out that needed to be put away. It seems like such a waste out of nothing but sheer laziness. I ended up putting everything in Tupperware and putting it in the fridge. His brother and his brother’s wife are going to eat the leftovers, which, if not for me, would have poisoned them because they would have sat out at room temperature all night.

I've dated all types of men in my life. I've been with men whose houses were cleaner than mine, who had super high standards of cleanliness. But the thing is that, despite how clean these men were on their own, as soon as I moved in or as soon as they got comfortable enough with me, they just stopped doing it. They still *expected* the same level of cleanliness, but they expected *me* to do it, despite the fact that I worked the same hours they did, or sometimes even more. 

I just don't understand it. Is there some kind of switch in men who date women? Do they think that women LOVE to cook and clean so much that we enjoy doing it for everyone? Or do they think that we just want a clean house so badly that we'll eventually give in and just do everything ourselves?  I really want a partner, but not at the expense of my free time, sanity and clean living environment. I don't understand — SO many women complain that these men just don't *do* anything to clean up after themselves, and I don't want to be put in that situation of resenting my partner because he sees me as some kind of live-in bangmaid. How hard is it to sit down to pee? Or wipe up the dribbles off the floor when you're done? How hard is it to put leftovers in the fridge? I am just afraid that me liking men means that I'm resigned to acting like a grown man's mother OR staying single for life. At this rate, the latter is looking like the more enjoyable option.",1663951157.0,diet_coke_cabal,TwoXChromosomes
Being long-term single is better for your well-being than sticking with a man who isn’t a good partner (even if it hurts sometimes).,"There are too many posts in this subreddit and others about women who are committed to men who are disrespectful, lazy, and, at worst, violent. A common comment is to encourage the woman to leave so that she can be available to find a better partner. 

The goal of leaving a relationship shouldn’t be to find a better one: the goal is to find peace, self-respect, and self-love. I’ve seen other posts about how being single is better than tying yourself to a man who is not a good partner. I’m writing to go one step further: The unfortunate truth is that you may not be able to find a better partner, and you may be single long-term or perhaps even forever; but that still doesn’t justify staying with a man who makes you deeply unhappy and makes your life more difficult. 

Like many of you, I was programmed from a very early age to center my life on romantic relationships. I was raised on Disney princess movies and teen magazines which persuaded me that my main goal in life was to convince a man to love me. I completely took for granted that I’d be able to lock down a decent guy as long as I wore makeup, stayed skinny, and followed These 10 Tricks to Catch His Eye. 

The media I consumed didn’t tell me to be proud of my accomplishments, how important female friendships are, and that I’m valuable as my own, independent person. It’s obvious now that Prince Charming would’ve had no interest in me in my 20s. A man who’s a good potential partner couldn’t see me as a good potential partner when I didn’t love or respect myself. It’s hard to admit but I myself wasn’t a quality partner in my 20s. No I didn’t cheat or anything like that, but I didn’t have standards for a healthy give and take in a romantic relationship; I derived too much self-esteem from whether or not I could attract men. 

I’m now able to admit that I’ve missed the boat. Just thinking statistically, there are very, very few men who are a good match for me: men who are respectful, kind, monogamous, not addicted to porn, looking for an equal partner not a bangmaid, who share my values, who have their lives together financially and emotionally, live in my area, are close enough to me in age, and are attractive to me. I have no doubt that this already very small population of men are almost entirely in committed, happy relationships- and I honestly wish those couples well. I’m not going to waiver on any of the criteria I listed above just to get a larger pool of men. I’ve tried that and it’s not worth putting up with someone I’m incompatible with just to avoid being single. 

And so I’m single and have accepted, logically, that I will be for the rest of my life. I’m here to be honest with you that, for the non-logical side of me, my feelings about being single ebb and flow. Most of the time I’m very much at peace with the life I’ve built, and feel very complete and content. Other times I’m heart wrenchingly sad and lonely. Not finding or even seeking my Prince Charming goes against my personal programming, as well as what I constantly see in media and in the world around me. Attending weddings can be difficult for me. I avoid music with overly sappy lyrics. It can be tough to not have a designated confidant, a shoulder to cry on; even the little things like “this meme made me laugh - who can I share this with?”. Yes I have close female friends, but I won’t lie to you and say they’re a perfect replacement for “The One”. 

But at the end of the day, I do know that I’m happier and healthier single than if I had stuck it out with one of the guys that I was “mostly” happy with. When I’m feeling the most lonely, I’m objectively better off than when I had to worry about splitting housework, sharing finances, having to walk on eggshells in my own home, having to plan my every day and my future around someone who didn’t hold up their half of the partnership. 

I know that the decision to leave a bad partner is more complicated when you have children. I don’t have children so I’ve never had to make that choice. I am, however, the child of unhappy parents who had an unhealthy marriage. Growing up there was no violence or verbal abuse in my household. But it did permanent damage to my view of relationships to see the lack of love and partnership between my parents. My mother told me that she’s a feminist, but I watched her joylessly take on the vast majority of domestic labor (while also working full time) with little support or affection from my dad. When I started entering romantic relationships, I held the bar so low for men because that’s what my parents showed me was normal and acceptable. I was trapped in a cycle for all of my 20s of having low self-esteem and low standards, leading to unhealthy romantic relationships, then lower self-esteem and standards when those relationships ended. Kids notice and learn from the example you set in your actions and choices. You can preach all you want, but kids internalize what behaviors they see parents actually practice. I’m not blaming my parents for all of my issues with self-esteem and dating, but I would’ve had a leg up if I had internalized what a healthy partnership looks like instead. 

I’m writing this to join hands with other women who already feel the same way, and to give food for thought to others who may be in the same boat but don’t realize it yet. I encourage you all to do what’s best for you and you alone, even if it’s sometimes uncomfortable, if not downright heartbreaking.",1691448110.0,loraren,TwoXChromosomes
Was I wrong to dump my bf because he can't cook?,"Or should I say ex boyfriend lol. So this happened last week and my best friend thinks I was wrong but my mother agrees with me. 

We'd been dating for around 8 months and whilst it was rather amusing at first that he couldn't cook, in the end it became infuriating. I'm talking not even being able to cook pasta or noodles, boiled eggs, even toast. Literally, couldn't cook at all. 
Obviously I did all the cooking and I wouldn't mind if chores were split but he did no housework at all. So when he stayed over at my house, I'd be constantly picking up his shit and clearing up after him. When I challenged him on this, he'd say ""well just tell me what to do and I'll do it."" I'd have to get home from work and cook him something, because he literally couldn't even feed himself. Even heating up leftovers. 


Like, why do I need to tell you dude? Picking your pants up off the floor, wet towels and pubes out the bathroom is literally just stuff every one does right?


So anyway, I'm a single mum (widowed) and my kids went to their grandparents for the weekend last week. It was my birthday and he asked me what I wanted so I said literally just a cup of tea and breakfast in bed. I don't care about presents or stuff but just doing that would be heaven. I ordered one of those recipe boxes where you buy the ingredients already weighed out and measured, recipe card is a step by step guide with pictures and even my 8 year old daughter can follow them. 
He said he'd try, so even though I had my doubts I spent the week looking forward to a lie in and when Saturday night comes around I even laid the stuff out for him for the next morning, including the dry ingredients, utensils and recipe card. The cold ingredients I put at the front of the fridge so he could find them easily. FI the recipe was eggs benedict on toasted English muffins (sauce is ready made) with bacon, grilled tomatoes and grilled asparagus. The recipe card stated it would take 15-20 minutes to cook. Don't forget I prepped everything for him too!

Sunday morning comes around and he gets up out of bed telling me he was going to make breakfast so I'm thinking to myself, great! A lie in, breakfast in bed and a cup of tea. What more could anyone want right ? Wrong. An hour goes by and still no sign. Another half an hour and I shout down asking if everything's OK? Yes he shouts. Another hour goes by so I get up and go see what's going on. 

I'm not lying when I say my kitchen was an absolute STATE. Literally every pot and pan used, smears of crap all over the place, burnt food. He still hasn't even finished cooking it, saying he can't turn the oven on. Like, it's literally just a dial and an on switch? 

I asked him why he hasn't asked me for help and he said he'd had to have a lie down because he was tired and he was gonna come get me to find the bacon. (At the front of the fridge where I'd put it the night before)

I showed him and then I snapped, telling him I'd had enough of his useless ass and to get the fuck out of my house. He looked shocked and yeah I was probably harsh but I work 60hours a week, I put my kids first for everything and never get any time for myself and he couldn't even make me a fucking cup of tea in bed. 

He left, saying I was shaming him for not being able to cook and that I was a massive bitch. Maybe I am? But I did everything for him and he couldn't even look up on YouTube how to poach a fucking egg. My mum says I'm well shot of him and that it would have ended up getting worse and looking after a third child but my best friend says I should give him another chance.

Edit: there's a few people saying I set him up to fail... I did nothing of the sort. It was my suggestion to order recipe boxes to start helping him learn to cook after months of promising me he'd start trying. He said it was a great idea and he'd do it. When it came to receiving the first box, I cooked a recipe out of it on the Saturday night to show him that it was pretty straightforward and he said he'd do the breakfast one on Sunday morning after I said I wanted breakfast in bed. I mean, the guy was promising he'd try and he wanted to do it etc etc, any normal person would either practise or say they couldn't do it and could he try something easier if it was beyond his abilities. But he insisted, despite my reservations. Also, breakfast in bed could have meant getting pastries or whatever brought in, it was he who saw the recipe card and said it looked great. 

All he had to do was poach a fucking egg, the rest of it was grilled. Step by step instructions with photos. Even the sauce was premade. Again, it's he who insisted he'd do it. I hardly think it's demanding of me?! 

Women really can't win can they.

Edit 2: I see the inc*ls have turned up. If you guys want his number since you're clearly so desperate to date him, I'll message you it. 

Edit 3: edit 2 was sarcasm jfc.

Last edit: thanks for all the support, there's some truly kind, wonderful people on here. As for those of you little prawn dicked men out there who felt the need to send me pics of your little grey worms and also the torrent of abuse I received from the incels in my inbox for daring to reject a man, fuck you.

Realized something significant I’ve stopped doing since childbirth…,"I’ve stopped softening my disappointment when my husband screws up/doesn’t follow through.   

I don’t berate him; I’m not mean or aggressive.  I just don’t go out of my way to relieve him—I let him deal with the discomfort of disappointing me on his own.     

Instead of saying: “Oh no, everything is peachy keen and super wonderful anyway!”    
I say: “Yeah, you messed up.  This is how that’s affecting me/us, & I need you to do better next time, please.”     

And don’t get me wrong:  My husband is a genuinely wonderful human being—but no one is perfect.  And just like before, after the error is realized we talk out solutions, rearrange our game plans, and get shit done.   

I think he’s noticed the change, but doesn’t have words to put to it.  At most, he seems to think I’m mad at him when I’m not.  But he also takes me at my word when I say as much.   

But I feel SO MUCH BETTER dropping that mental load.  I’m no longer compelled to manage that emotion for him; it’s off of my plate.    

*It’s okay*.  I’m not relentlessly insisting everything is okay, and yet *everything ends up okay anyway*.   

Maybe it’s a small thing, but as a recovering people-pleaser it feels big to me.   

EDIT   
I’m going to say some more, since this is getting some attention & I won’t be able to respond to everyone:  

I did not become a people pleaser because my husband coerced me into that—I was already one when we met, and his embrace of me as a person has allowed me to stop doing that.  He makes me feel safe!   

You can liken his discomfort I described to the feeling you have when you expect another stair to be there, but the floor is flat.  A harmless, momentary, missed expectation, and then you move on.   

I would say I’m shocked by the number of people who are equating lack of coddling (that he never asked for) with emotional abuse & neglect… but this is the internet, so I’m not surprised, lol.   

But for the record:  Asking your partner to do better & letting them know you’re disappointed is okay—good for you even!  It’s healthy to accept that we disappoint the ones we love sometimes, and that we need to keep trying.   

Thank you to everyone who has been kind & supportive!!   

To all my chronic people-pleasing sisters: Most likely no one is mad at you!  And if they are, as long as you’ve done your best, been honest and open, *that’s okay.*  Let them.",1700288464.0,WateryTart_ndSword,TwoXChromosomes
"Women who are uncertain about dating trans men, I'm here to answer questions","I'm a 26 year old gender queer trans man. 

A not negligible amount of woman have informed me the idea of dating a trans man makes them nervous because they are afraid of doing an oopsie and hurting their partner's feelings, making them feel dysphoric, etc. They have questions they have no one to ask because they don't want to go around badgering random trans people, and good on them for that, but that they have no other resource.

Luckily I'm a visibly queer person from a white trash family in heart of oil country--- there's probably not anything that could say to me my feelings have not already had to endure.

Does anyone else have a male partner who views him going to the gym as providing to the whole household?,"Sorry, I know this is talking about men and won't apply to a good chunk of you. But I feel like I'm going a bit crazy here and need to ask some women on their experience. 

Does your male partner (if they go to the gym regularly) act like this is something they do as a way to provide for the whole household? Its not a hobby for them, they work AND go to the gym whereas you (the woman) just work (assuming you don't go to the gym) therefore you need to do more for the household to make up for this effort gap? 

I have just noticed my partner has this mentality. He doesn't have much time or energy because of it, but its on me to support this lifestyle instead of on him maybe doing less of his hobby. 

I subtly talked about it to my male friends sp I'm not pointing fingers and I get a similar reaction, that they go to the gym for themselves, but also as a way to provide. 

If it was completely up to me to pick selfishly if my partner was to go to the gym or not, I would make him stay at home. Of course its not my choice and I'm happy he has this thing he enjoys and is passionate about, but beyond that him going to the gym provides nothing of value to me.

Does anyone else notice this pattern of behaviour or is it just me? Do I need to have a sit down convo with the men in my life?

Edit: I know exercise is good for your health and shouldn't be considered solely a hobby, particularly if you are doing the reccomended few hours a week focusing on health. He easily does 15+ hours a week. I think it becomes a hobby at that point. ",1701032519.0,throwraPlane_Sky6562,TwoXChromosomes
My husband keeps telling me that I said something different from what has come out of my mouth,"I'm currently going through a pattern with my partner about how he claims that I said something that I never did, or twists my words. I'm about to start recording every damn conversation because I know deep down in my soul that I didn't misspeak. 

For example, one instance was the following conversation today (me being me, and partner is my husband):

**Me:** we're going to be getting snow on Saturday night and Sunday! weather shows between 3 and 13 inches, but I'll keep an eye on it as we get closer.

**Partner:** oh awesome! 

**Me:** I know! good thing we're going to Massachusetts on Saturday so we can enjoy the snow.

**Partner: \***starts mumbling to self\* I'll need to prepare just a few things this week. We could also go to MA on Sunday?

**Me:** well the snow starts on Saturday night and goes through Sunday.

**Partner:** You said it starts on Saturday and ends on Monday.

**Me:** No, it starts on Saturday and goes through Sunday...

**Partner:** You said Monday, but it's okay.

*I stood there for a moment dumbstruck and thinking did I actually say Monday, to which he took my silence as thinking he was angry?*

**Partner:** You did say Monday but again, it's okay.

Internet strangers, I promise you all that I didn't say Monday. But if I pushed back, he would get super defensive and stand his ground. Another example happened right before Christmas and it was not a fun time for me. He will not believe me one bit if I say anything different from what he tells me that I said.

I don't even know what to do anymore, since it happened AGAIN just a few minutes ago but this time I pushed back. Then he walks away and says ""we're just mad at each other and need space"". I wasn't mad before but lord am I mad now, so much so that I immediately went outside and threw a branch into the woods as hard as I could.

Started going down the manosphere podcast bros rabbit hole and I see men differently now,"So I used to have an ex who would follow redpill and manosphere accounts on instagram. He would send me videos and tell me that this is what men wanted and how women should be etc. He ended up being a pretty shitty partner and I broke up with him.

I ended up watching the instagram videos just out of my own curiosity and looking through comments where hundreds if not thousands of men would write things like 
“they think they’re attractive now just wait until their 35 single and alone with a cat” 
“women deserve less” 
“women over 25 are low value 304’s and ran through” “women are just meant to pump and dump” 
“if she goes on girls trips she’s for the streets” 
“non virgins are for recreational use only” and many other hateful things. All these comments would have hundreds if not thousands of likes. So clearly many many men are in agreement. 

After that I don’t think I want to date men anymore. What’s the point if they all feel like this deep down? And my ex who was into redpill seemed like a really good guy at first, people think he’s so nice. But he’s a misogynist too.

Anyone know what I mean? I can’t see myself being married to and having children to someone who would hold me in such low regard.",1705680205.0,aliarai,TwoXChromosomes
A random man commented on the amount of food I was having for lunch,"Sometimes y'all post stories like this and for the many many MANY bad experiences I've had with men, a stranger stopping me to comment on food and/or weight has not been one of them. Until now...

I had dr appts and errands yesterday and after running around for the better part of the day, I stopped at a fantastic well-known deli to grab a late lunch (and my first meal of the day). I bought a kale/quinoa salad and a personal charcuterie ""board"" (it was a SMALL handful of cheese cuts, sunflower seeds, and dried fruit with a side of honey). These things were given to me in clear plastic to-go containers. As I left the cafe and started walking down the sidewalk, a man in his \~50's matched my speed and said ""are you going to eat all that by yourself?""

At first, I wasn't sure I even heard him correctly but just said, ""I sure am!"" and the dude goes ""wow, that's a lot of food!"" I stopped walking, took my headphones out, and just stared at him for a second or two before saying ""...it's a salad and cheese."" He looked flustered and goes, ""well I'm much older than you, it's a lot of food for me."" I said, ""that sucks for you,"" put my headphones in, and walked in the opposite direction.

I married a short nerd who only had a couple sexual partners prior to me and plays dnd in his free time, because his mind is so pretty and he has his head on straight. You don’t get women because you’re a loser who would rather insult women on the internet than work on yourself. I’m happy to share screenshots of incels harassing me in DM’s. If they are so brilliant and their opinions are so strong, they can share them publicly. RIGHT?! u/okwithok ?!! And u/Powerful-Art-5156 — where you at now? 

3. Oh no. My success has REALLY upset the incels. A man in the comments and another in my DM’s went through my post history and said I’m full of shit because I’m an executive when I said I model. It’s not possible to be smart and conventionally attractive to these men? I’m a healthcare executive. I’ve modeled for years on the side. That was my first job. I also am a mixed media artist. Lesser men…are you triggered? Good. I also have a great high kick. 

Ps: THE GREATEST BEAUTY IS THE MIND

***u/proud_boomer — [says he saw pictures of me and I “look like a trans woman”](https://imgur.com/a/KL4zBgR). He didn’t see photos of me and I’m not sure how this is even an insult considering the sheer amount of stunning trans women out there. He assumes everyone must be transphobic like himself.***

Trans women are women, you peabrain. And I love them. WE love them here. 

***u/thotblaster420 — messaged me accusing me of getting him brigaded for calling out his incel DM’s — so he has since harassed “dozens of women” to punish me. He said “I motivated him” to abuse them. [I have a screenshot of this](https://imgur.com/a/tEZG027). He messaged me again saying he was banned but just created another account specifically to harass women.***

No surprise coming from a guy with a comment history about how pussy is better without hair. Not that he’d ever have the opportunity to pick mine out of his teeth.

I’m DONE putting up with men who don’t treat the clit how I treat their penis,"This past week I have finally put my foot down. 

After yet another night of getting not even a touch from the man I was seeing after I sucked, rimmed, sucked more, and got on top and gave penetration to to make him orgasm.

He was shocked when I dumped him.

I then showed him NINE screen shots over two months of me telling him what I want, how to do it, and four screen shots of me telling him he didn’t even touch my clit once the entire night of hooking up.

He was shocked, begging me to give him another chance. As it should be!!!! Let it be a fucking lesson to him and hopefully the next woman he comes into contact with will thank me. 

Then this hook up buddy who was similar text me and I was like you’re awful at pleasuring women, you are great at getting yourself off. He said I was being mean and callous. GOOD!!! GET THE FUCKING CLUE. AND STOP TALKING TO ME, I said. 

It feels so good to finally speak up against these selfish men. I am finally done SETTLING. ASKING FOR THE BARE MINIMUM.",1654701349.0,fucktheraiders88,TwoXChromosomes
"So, apparently saying woman's body count matters to have a healthy family is not sexist now (venting)","So I've (29F) been seeing this guy (30M) for 3 months. He asked me about my body count early on, to which I initially replied that we shouldn't go there. But he insisted and said it was important for him so I told him. 
It's not that high. I've been sexually active since 18 and it's below 10. So his initial reaction was bad and I confronted him about it. He said that he just didn't expect it and it caught him off guard. 
Fast forward to our last conversation about the future. I said that I plan to have a family in the next 6 years but I'm still figuring it out but kinda already date with this intention. He brought up my body count saying how he would want a future wife to be more prudish and not having so many men under her belt (pun not intended). He actually said this phrase about how she should be saving herself for marriage. I said it was sexist and hypocritical of him since he did have other girls but he denies that it is. He claims it's good for a healthy family and he also doesn't want his woman to compare him to her previous partners. He doesn't think it makes him insecure. Man, I hate this nonsense. Why is it that in this day and age relatively young people still have these archaic beliefs? 

Tl;dr guy spews sexist bullshit, claims he's not sexist in my face.

Edit: thank you all for support. I wanted to add that I wasn't ideal either and had my own share of fuck ups regarding this guy, for which I promptly apologized. He wasn't outwardly insulting or abusive towards me so I have no hard feelings really. We just didn't align. He was emotionally dismissive of me, I had my meltdowns. Now it's all good and sorted. This was just the nail on the coffin. Kinda liberating. 
Sorry, I post from mobile, can't edit properly.
Thanks again!

Another edit: he reached out after this blew up, backpedaling. I'll deal with this later, longest day ever, I have no more energy for today. I guess, there will be an update? Anyways, I read a lot, I laughed a lot, thank you all for the support!

Another one: wow, this really blew up. Just have to say, he didn't use the term ""body count"". English isn't our native language. I see a lot of comments referring to incel culture. Sorry for misleading. Honestly, I didn't know it came from incels, thought it came from just douchebags in general, had to use it because in my mind it was the same as asking how many guys you've slept with.",1675006201.0,constantreminiscence,TwoXChromosomes
My partner (M/28) broke up with me (F/28) because I refused to promise to stay within a healthy BMI in the future,"So as the title suggests, my ~5 year long partner broke up with me because I refused to promise him ‘to do everything in my power’ to stay within the normal BMI as long as we stay together (I am in a healthy weight range right now, but don’t have good genetics). He is generally acknowledging the fact that I would have gained weight during pregnancy/cies, but expects me to back to the normal weight/BMI thereafter.

His rationale is that 1) he wouldn’t be able to have sex with someone overweight and so would never be happy with anyone above the normal BMI; 2) if I care about our relationship, I should be able to understand that slimness is important to him and should be able to prioritise my fitness above other things (e.g. career). His expectation, for example, is that if I were to be offered a unique managerial opportunity, I should turn it down if taking it would mean that I no longer have time to exercise and fight my hypothetical extra weight.

My point of view is that I cannot promise to stay within the ‘normal’ weight/BMI because (a) life is so freaking unpredictable and there is literally a million reasons as to why a woman who works 10-11 hours a day and plans to have kids one day might struggle to keep off the extra weight; and (b) there are more important things/ priorities in life and keeping a model physique is not an end goal for me, but rather something ‘nice to have’.

I am completely heart-broken because I genuinely thought that I would be with this person long-term (we have been already trying to have kids and I was super excited about that).

Am I wrong here in not giving my partner that promise (which realistically I might not be able to keep and which goes against my personal values) at the expense of us breaking up?

UPD: 
* Thank you everyone for all your messages, support and points of view which I found very helpful. They definitely helped get through a pretty bad day.
** I did also receive dozens of messages from men asking me to prove that I’m not overweight / that I’m good-looking / that I’m ‘worthy of my ex’ / to send a pic to prove that (jesus, seriously) - if that was your response, you missed the point of post: there has been nothing wrong with my body/figure, but bf was just paranoid I might gain weight in the future.",1639391578.0,holmes_k,TwoXChromosomes
"Ladies, I could use some support","My husband is sick with a sore throat which is apparently so bad that he will physically spasm if he tries to swallow. As a result, he been either sleeping or laying around on his phone.
We are on day 4 of our vacation in a foreign country. He’s taken over the hotel room with his mess and housekeeping can’t even come in because he won’t leave the room.

 I’ve been running around all week getting him medicine, porridge, getting us water, etc. I’ve been trying to keep it together and make the best of it, but something just snapped today. We got in a fight. He accused me of not thinking his sickness is a big deal. I told him I don’t think it is but despite that I have been running around like his personal slave regardless. I offered taking him to a clinic or hospital every day and he refuses. If it weren’t for me, he would have refused to get medicine too. He just doesn’t do anything. 

He says he’s sorry he can’t meet my standards as if I’m asking so much from him. He says he hasn’t been able to sleep well and he’s in pain so he hasn’t prioritized being a good partner. He says that he appreciates everything I’ve done but I want him to engage and he doesn’t want to and there’s nothing for him to engage with. 

After all that he’s suddenly ok to leave the room so housekeeping can clean. I’ve been crying so he left to get food.  Housekeeping of course came into the room just after so I had to explain via google translate why I was crying my eyes out. Im so mortified and deflated 😔

Edit:
A BIG THANK YOU to everyone for the replies. I really appreciated reading the comments, and I think a kick in the behind was what I needed. 
I felt super poopy after crying so I took a day to sleep. I think he either found this post or realized just how mad I am because he’s left me alone and also stopped groaning out loud. 

For those that suggested getting him meds, he already has pain relievers, lozenges, and throat spray. Since he has the essentials, a working phone, and is a grown adult. I am going to go out by myself tomorrow. 

Thank you again for the empathy, and in some cases, the wake up call that we are both adults. I got caught up being so frustrated that I just felt stuck. I’m going to get a big glass of sangria tonight and enjoy tomorrow.

"PSA: If your husband suggested or demanded a fatherhood test, please read this.","So I recently develop an interest in genetic testing (as a research field), and a few posts related to the subject landed me here on r/TwoXChromosomes:

[My husband did a paternity test behind my back](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2cqhzm/my_husband_did_a_paternity_test_behind_my_back/), and [Yes (some) men, demanding DNA tests IS insulting](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/j8mbtu/yes_some_men_demanding_dna_tests_is_insulting/) and the recent popular one [Refuse to take pregnancy tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xuil57/refuse_to_take_pregnancy_tests/).

When I saw this comment:

>In the UK **20% of men are unknowingly raising children** that are not biologically theirs . It’s not an insult to paternity test in the face of these type of statistics. It may be hurtful but it’s definitely necessary imo.

I wonder, questions such [as this one in Quora](https://www.quora.com/It-is-often-whispered-that-in-any-society-10-30-of-fathers-unknowingly-raise-non-biological-children-as-theirs-How-true-is-this), are not uncommon, and this kind of argument is being thrown even in this sub (with upvotes!), as fresh as 2 years, justifies the nature of a PSA-like post.

As often I see statistics being biased for other fields and less politically-related reasons, there is a good this chance this kind of statistics results are understood in a way biased towards the male perspective, but the reality is much worse. **It is literally** ***incel*** **rage bait.**

**The 20-30% positive-ratio comes from the studies that analyze the results of paternity tests, not the paternity results of all married men.**

It may seem intuitive to extrapolate that to the general population, but that is not logically sound, as men looking for paternity tests are disputing inheritances or divorces in court, especially when they are distrustful of the wife prior to the fact. It is a biased sample.

When scientists analyzed the paternity rates for the children of fathers of people with genetic disorders, a much more broad and complete dataset, the results came between 1% and 3% only, depending on the country and study. Those results can be extrapolated to the general population with a significant degree of confidence, contrary to studies based solely on paternity tests.

Scientists themselves in one of the most extensive and comprehensive of these studies, based on the premise of this cultural pop-myth, using the latter dataset, ""[were surprised by the low numbers](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2016/cuckolded-fathers-are-surprisingly-rare-DNA-evidence-shows)"".

**tl;dr: Don't do it, statistically speaking, men are NOT unknowingly raising children that are not theirs. That is a fake-news talking point that feeds misogynistic believes. If he is guided by this popular belief or you think he doesn't has good intentions, it is your right to confront him.**

**^(In my opinion:)** ^(Asking or even demanding a test is multiple more times more likely to at the best scenario, annoy your partner, and at the worst scenario, really undermine the trust of your partner in the long term.)",1664823179.0,tsyklon_,TwoXChromosomes
Men on reddit commenting about them not getting sex from their wives always makes me uncomfortable,"It happens in EVERY major thread with the topic of sex, relationships, etc. Sometimes even as off-topic comments.

It's genuinely always the same type of thing: ""I wish my wife wasn't such a boring stuckup when it comes to sex, I wiggle my penis in her direction once-twice a month and she refuses to take the bait, I guess that's what marriage does to women ha-ha""

Even worse are the men replying to such (most often highly upvoted) comments. Just today I read one such comment from a man ""joking"" how his greatest kink is to hopefully have sex with his wife maybeee once a month, but his wife isn't ""thrilled"" about his ""disgusting"" request. The replies are your typical misogynistic ""well I'll never marry because I refuse to be bound to a single woman who won't even give me any after couple of years"" bs excuses.

I genuinely can't help but feel that most men don't put enough effort into pleasing their (female) partners, let alone god forbid making her orgasm once every full moon. They act super entitled to (PIV) sex but will do absolute bare minimum to ensure their girlfriends/wives are satisfied (we're still pretending clit is hard to find)

I'm observing this as a lesbian, and this seems to be so SHOCKINGLY common among heterosexual marriages/relationships, at least from what I can see from hundreds of replies here and elsewhere. I see comments like the ones I mentioned, coupled with women commenting how they had to go through a dozen + partners to find a remotely good man when it comes to sex. And often times how he changes for the worse after they marry and have children. 

Like of COURSE your wife won't be interested in sex with you when your whole life you've been told that all you gotta do to please a woman is present your dick and she'll magically orgasm from the mere sight of it. Thanks porn. On top of that women are expected to work, raise their children, do house chores AND on top of that, more often than not take care of their male partners needs and clean after him. Also they're expected to look perfectly pretty, shaven, young and presentable at almost any age, while their husbands age, get a belly, and often have questionable hygiene and do jackshit about their appearance. Then they wonder why women aren't in the mood. No, men are not ""more visual"" than women and women arent attracted exclusively to your personality.

How can any married woman feel satisfied and willing, when her basic needs are not even met? Seriously it's not that hard to please a woman. 

Sorry for the rant but holy shit. I hate bringing my sexuality into the discussion but I genuinely feel that women are much more attentive to their female partners in general, not just when it comes to sex. 

In conclusion I think it's more the fact that a shocking amount of men are shitty, selfish partners all around rather than women not having a sex drive. Maybe they're the problem?? Let's not forget how men are statistically more likely to dump their female partners if she's unable to have sex due to medical conditions etc as well. 

I sympathize with heterosexual women and just wanted to vent, because honestly reddit is so full of these dumb posts by entitled, clueless men.

My friend (m) got angry because I refused to change my profile photo,"This happened just very recently today and frankly, was both amusing and saddening situation. 

Backstory: This person, a man, has been my language learning partner for about a year. Mainly our conversations have been very casual - occasionally he would send me photos of his dinner or of different places he visited. I always assumed that we were just friends as there never was any flirting between us. I never really felt a big cultural difference between us - we didn't really chat about religion, politics or anything that would turn into a cultural war. Just general ""oh, this is how you do \*that\*? Funny, we do \*that\* so differently"" and then laugh about it. 

So you can imagine that what happened today was 100% unexpected. I was feeling good this morning so, I wanted to take few new selfies and at the same time update my profile photos on different platforms. It wasn't long after I received a message from him stating that ""the glasses really don't make you look good"". 

 Previously I've had most of my photos taken without the glasses as I didn't really like how they looked. However, I have really liked my new glasses and felt confident about wearing them. I never really considered the photos without glasses as cat fishing as my face otherwise remained the same. Perhaps I've been wrong about this? 

Anyway, I thought he was joking at first, but as I explained my bad eyesight and the fact that I liked these new glasses he became very persistent. He continued repeatedly telling me how much older I looked. Not old as ""mature and classy"" but old as an old and ugly grandma. He then suggested I should re-take the photo without glasses. 

Obviously, I got frustrated. I found him repeating the same line very rude. He wasn't being typically polite either, his language was very blunt. I told him 1. he doesn't need to look at the photo so closely if it bothers him so much 2. I liked this photo (honestly the only thing that mattered). 3. I've had several photos without glasses so this was for a change. After all, that's me in the photo and that's my appearance most of the time (being kind of generous here, I wouldn't put that  much effort into my looks on daily basis).   

Then he completely flipped - he accused me of not ever listening to his advice, that he only wanted what was ""the best for me"" and how I was too stubborn and hard headed. He was also referring to our older convo of me talking about a sensitive topic and how ""I would just keep on repeating the same mistakes"". On top of that he ended his message with ""Goodbye forever"". 

What the heck just happened??? Did I just lose ""a friend"" over something so stupid? Was he even a friend to begin with? And why on earth he would think his ""advice"" would be appreciated when I never asked any advice to begin with????

I guess the trash took itself out. Yet, I feel saddened for many reasons. Even if he wanted to be helpful he completely missed the mark - I never asked for his opinion about the matter and moreover, the way he said it sounded very... controlling? As in "" I don't like how you look in this photo so change it"", which is ridiculous especially since the photo is not even offensive! It is just me.

But hey, I guess women are illogical and emotional or whatever.

Edit: thank you so much for your comments! They have given me a lot to think about and honestly it just felt good to vent. I will definitely look for a new language learning partner but I think this was also a good time to have a little break. I want to clarify few things: 
1. Somebody mentioned him being an immigrant? Perhaps I misunderstood the original comment but he wasn't an immigrant. We live in different continents. Explaining his behaviour as being ""uncivilized immigrant"" is just plain wrong. I aproached him because he was a local and was willing to chat with me in his native language. 
2. While arguable we couldn't had been close friends I  considered him a friend - if I was ever to travel to his country I would have definitely seek out for his advice and help. He seemed reliable and trustworthy. I would have wanted to meet him over a cup of coffee. Not anymore. 
3. He is blocked. 

As an extra treat I would like to include the ""outraging"" photo that started this crap show. [view at your own risk](https://imgur.com/a/EIV3Y8e)",1686232955.0,embbunen,TwoXChromosomes
Why are women’s orgasms seen as optional?,"Last night my husband and I had sex. It was good but he finished moments before I would have and then proceeded to get up and go shower. I laid there and debated whether to tell him how uncomfortable I was, having gotten close to an orgasm and then having the rug ripped out from under my feet. 

I did end up telling him and he gave a half-hearted offer to hand me a vibrator from the bottom drawer, explaining that since we don’t have sex much lately he doesn’t have much stamina (we have a 12 month old so the last year has been exhausting) I told him I didn’t want to keep him up. He went to sleep. 

This morning all I can think about is passive aggressive thoughts about how he never initiates anymore and when we do have sex he goes “straight for the goods” instead of “warming up my engine” first. (Which would probably help the problem of him finishing and me not finishing.) It feels like he doesn’t seem to care anymore about my orgasm. This is a big change to how things were even just a couple summers ago before I got pregnant. Pregnancy and postpartum put a hell of a strain on our sex life. 

I know sex changes in a relationship over time, and we’ve been together for 7 years, but I do NOT like this new attitude he seems to have developed in the past year. I’m also just so frustrated because I feel like women’s orgasms just aren’t valued in general. Men would never tolerate stopping JUST before they finished so why is it ok to do that to a woman? And I know orgasms aren’t the goal of sex but this morning I’m just so annoyed that I can’t think clearly. 

I feel the need to say that my husband is, in all other regards, an awesome person. So please don’t suggest I “throw the whole man away” when he just needs a tune up.

I’m so sick of reading posts about bad husbands (RANT),"”Hi guys, so, I’ve just had our fourth baby and I’m so tired. My husband does nothing to help and he never does, he’s never even changed a nappy, so I have to do all the night feeds by myself, he also expects the house to look like a show home, with no mess or dishes, and have a three course meal served every night. But that’s just life as a busy wife and mom haha amirite?! So anyway, here’s the issue. My husband doesnt use soap, he says it’s girly and that real men don’t do it. And as it’s hot at the moment and he doesn’t change his underwear daily, he kind of smells? I don’t like it and my second eldest said the smell of her dads feet makes her feel sick. I’ve asked him if he would at least use deoderant, but he yelled at me saying it was “gay”. He’s now gone out for his fortnightly fishing weekend with the lads where they drink beers and watch football. He also demands nightly sex but never does any foreplay and refuses to do oral. I am slightly upset at how I am treated, but my mother says this is just the reality of being married and having children. Am I being unfair? How can I make things better for us?”

I’ve seen so many variations of this and my response is always WHY ARE YOU MARRIED TO THIS MANCHILD?! At best, he is useless, at worst he is an actual menace to the household. Come on ladies, know your worth, stop enabling this crappy behaviour and stop marrying these pathetic creatures. Stop having kids with them. And if you’ve already got kids with them, leave him, get child support and hire someone to do the household  jobs he should be doing.

If I see one more post about men who don’t do chores, look after their kids, and don’t know basic hygiene, I think I might have to start hunting them for sport.

I find it genuinely disappointing that so many women think they have to put up with this. You don’t! Leave. Him. Better yet, don’t marry him! Find someone else who’s not a complete tool.

I’ve genuinely lost attraction to men,"Ever since I hit puberty I was boy crazy. Planned my wedding from the age of 10. I would sigh and dream about every cute boy that caught my eye, which was all of them. I was a horny little mess for sooo many years. 

I’m married now and I should say I love and am attracted to my husband, as it should be, but from the very beginning of our marriage  we explored polyamory together. For a couple of years we were open and while I know this isn’t usually the case for most couples, our relationship thrived. Our communication, boundary setting, trust, sex life together improved massively. 

However I’ve since closed up the relationship because the amount of men out there that are genuinely terrible people is shocking. Men who have absolutely no loyalty or accountability to their partners, going out and trying to cheat. Men who will try to coerce you into sex and get pissy when you say no. Men who are so staggeringly emotionally immature they’d get with a married lady and then be JEALOUS of her husband when she made the situation clear from the get go. 

The men with the lack of sexual discipline get me the most. They’re literally like animals, existing solely off their animal instincts. No dignity, no class. They’ll whip their dick out for literally any woman or thing that looks their way. It seems bizarre for an ex polyamorous person to be complaining about the level of thirst these guys exhibit, but it’s literally revolting. 

It’s completely tainted my entire perception of the gender to the point where sometimes I look at my husband and wonder, “what kind of depraved bullshit are you hiding?”. Those thoughts don’t stick because my husband is genuinely a good man and I lucked out with him. But if I ever end up single again, I think I’m just going to find a way to be content on my own. I got to take a peek at the modern dating world behind the safety net of my marriage and holllyyyyy crap, forget it. These men are sick. 

I see an attractive man now and whereas before my mind would start racing with steamy scenarios, now all I think is “yeah but he probably has something irredeemably wrong with him.” 

I almost miss my innocent and naivety. Can anyone else relate?

Edit: If you’re a man getting mad at me for talking about men and sharing my experiences…. Well they’re my experiences. And clearly a lot of other womens as well. Maybe instead of getting mad at us you can like, I dunno, encourage yourself and other men to be better?  Rather than coming on a WOMANS sub to whine at us for venting our frustrations. God damn it.

Oh no! The women are waking up to our bullshit! Quick, NOT ALL MEN!!!

Edit 2: to the guy who DM’ed me and said that they hope I get stoned by Arabs (because I’m middle eastern), you’re exactly everything that’s wrong with your gender. Thanks for proving my point. Women criticize men for being shitty, men react by threatening violence and wishing death on women. And we’re the emotional irrational ones 🙄 get a grip on something other than your mediocre dicks

Edit 3: I woke up and this post exploded. It’s both really validating and really sad to read to many comments from women who feel the same way and agree with me. Wanna know what’s even more sad though? The dumbass men who are bitching about sexism in the comments and in my DMs. I know it’s hard to think past your mushroom head, but the “sexism” in my post is nothing like the sexism women experience at the hands of men. Men get their feelings hurt, women die. That’s the difference between our sexism. They’re not the same. Also misandry is a direct response to misogyny. If men weren’t so awful and dangerous, women wouldn’t be saying this shit. All you men want to do is silence us as you’ve done for millennia. You can all rightfully get fucked, by most likely your right hand because your personalities are putrid. 

To those comparing me to incels…. Clearly getting laid is not my issue. Your false equivalencies are embarrassing. 

And finally to the men who have been leaving positive comments, I appreciate you. I hope you do your best to improve the state of your gender.

ONE LAST EDIT because I’ve seen You this repeated over and over again: 

“You’ve run into the worst of us because you were practicing polyamory and that filters out all the good men” 

Firstly, yes the lifestyle I partook in definitely attracted assholes. Having said that, it is not my fault that I exposed to these creeps because of my lifestyle. I always went into every encounter with openness and communicated my expectations and needs very clearly. It is not my fault then that these men continually pushed my boundaries. It’s not my fault they lie and cheat on their partners. It’s not my fault they have no sexual discipline. That’s on them, not me. 

Furthermore, the men I met who were actually polyamorous were rarely the problematic ones. It was the regular cishet men who tout monogamy (but then cheat), push their misogynistic beliefs onto us, and can’t take no for an answer. 

If you actually read the comments, the majority of which are from monogamous women, you’ll find that this is a very common experience they have as well. It’s not because I’m polyamorous, it’s because those men are trash. 

One last thing - I only speak of my traumas through my polyamory experience. I haven’t even gotten into the sexual assaults I experienced before marriage, I didn’t get into how my male cousin tried for years to fuck me, I didn’t talk about how I only realized a few years ago that the older man I trusted was actively grooming me when I was a teen and I was too naive to realize. It’s only through the eyes of a grown woman now that I finally see what was happening. Even the “mild” example of how boys in my family would name their cars after girls…. Because women are objects right??

So whiny messages from men about how “wErE nOt RaPiStS aNd CrEepS” ….. enough of you are that’s it’s absolutely not worth it to associate with you. And the more you fight back against that the more you prove my point. Y’all don’t fucking listen even when we tell you the truth to your faces.

But being attracted to your partner is one of the fundamental things in relationships! Not just physically, but also personality wise. There are some people who are perfectly nice, attractive physically even, but their personality is not your cup of tea. You don’t mesh together. 
I’ve had to explain to a surprising amount of guys that they aren’t horrible because I’m not interested. I always give them the bakery example.

“You walk into a bakery and see a cupcake and a croissant. You choose the croissant. There is nothing wrong with the cupcake. You’re just a croissant person.”

I’ve also been blamed for leading people on so many times when I thought I was very clear. One guy I told at least five times over the course of our friendship that I wasn’t interested romantically and never would be. I told him I could give him some space if he needed it (I valued him as a friend). But he still claimed he felt led on because “I didn’t treat him like any other girl”. Hey man, it’s just my personality! 

I told another guy directly like three times, but before that I thought it was pretty obvious I wasn’t into him. Hell, he asked me for my number the first day of class and I told him he could have it if we were in a group project together. He tried to hug me once and I high-fived him instead. That feels pretty “I’m not into you” to me. 

Then I had another friend who I would hang out with at a coffee shop pretty much weekly. I had a boyfriend but I didn’t mention it to him because I didn’t realize he was into me and my relationship was on the down low because of some family issues so I wasn’t used to talking about it. 
He told me he liked me. I told him I wasn’t interested. And I thought that was that. Later he found out I had a bf during that time and told me he never would have hung out with me if he knew (because he thought it broke some kind of guy code?). He wanted to know why I didn’t tell him when he told me he liked me. I just thought me saying I’m not interested was enough. I had to explain to that same guy months later that I didn’t have a spark with him and he tried to convince me that I should date him regardless because a “spark” doesn’t matter in the long run.

But it does.

Our preferences matter.

When we say no we mean it.

We don’t just hang out to be in relationships. 

We want friendships sometimes too.

Honestly, I think those last couple sentences are a good TL;DR for this one.

Edit: Someone pointed out to me that asexual people show that physical attractiveness isn’t necessary in all relationships! Thank you to them. Being attracted to your partner in general whether it’s to their looks, personality, or both is important.

Edit 2: Somehow I have men in the comments angry about this post. It’s really not that hard to understand. If we say no we mean no and you should believe us. If you need to stop being friends then you need to figure that out and be upfront about it. Not all women have the same preferences.",1697820080.0,graciebeeapc,TwoXChromosomes
Have you ever met a man who thought having pubic hair was bad hygiene?,"I just have to get this off my mind. My ex had a serious conversation with me (while we were still together) about my “bad hygiene” AKA having pubic hair. Don’t get me wrong, I 100% understand having a preference and am willing to honor that for my partner, but…pubic hair is not inherently bad hygiene. Quite the opposite, actually.

I just have to ask…why are men? 🧐🤔

ETA: the majority of comments are assuming I have a wild bush/he doesn’t groom. I’ll just add to the post the comment I left in response to someone else:

“He does shave, but still doesn’t make it any less asinine that he thinks it’s just bad hygiene to have it at all. Not to mention, I’d prefer to get waxed but haven’t been able to because I just finished Accutane, so haven’t really been able to maintain it as well as I’d like. I trim, but I refuse to razor shave because it itches and razor burn is more unsightly than a bush imo.”",1662751998.0,Ordinary-Season5822,TwoXChromosomes
My husband put an air tag in my vehicle. The count is up to 3 air tags now.,"Hello it’s me. I am safe. The kids are safe. My resources and support are here helping in anyway they can. Today CPS showed up to my place of shelter. They said my husband told them where I was when they could not contact me because he shut my phone off. They told me he put an air tag on my vehicle. I just did an entire interview with them. I was so scared when the process started - but after they left I felt so supported. They validated that everything he is doing is abuse- he is in the wrong. They told me DO NOT GIVE HIM THE CHILDREN. They said do not answer the door, do not go anywhere until your car has the air tag removed. My brothers girlfriend is taking it right now to the police station. I still haven’t got a protective order. I don’t know what the hold up is but I am so so scared. I listened to the recording of the Sunday fight again (it was so traumatizing all over again to relive that) in the recording when I said I want a divorce he said he is going to end my life. I’m picking up my new phone today with an entire new number. I am really scared everyone. He knows where I am, he knows now that I told CPS he is abusive. The principal of my child’s school is my husbands bosses wife. CPS said the domestic abuse advocates will have to use their attorneys to get my son in a new school right now. Everyone pray, send good vibes, cast a spell, whatever it is that you do… please do it for me right now. I am terrified and I don’t know how much more I can do than I have done. Let this be a lesson to all of the people with abusive partners- turn the “find my iPhone” off BEFORE you leave. Stash money back. Call the shelter. Make a plan. They will try to destroy you and any kids you have together when their image is threatened.",1679074206.0,imnotperfectsowhat,TwoXChromosomes
"If you have a child with my son in the future, we will not love them the same way we love our other grandchildren, because they will be half black.","Today I took my significant other and his parents out to eat  for the first time.We've been dating for over a year and have put off meeting his parents because they're racist. That statement above was dropped in the middle of dinner. Unpromted. 

Before that little comments were said.

""Don't worry CoroBora, we'll pay since this is a pretty expensive place you probably didn't know.""...... Okay Man I picked it out and I invited you. 

""What happened to that last girl you were dating? Her name was Megan! Oh she was such a lady! She was so sweet and her hair was so gorgeous and tame."" - Megan is now a Michael and transitioned FtM. Okay so you don't like my natural wild afro

Food arrives and I ask for a bottle of wine, and a slice of my SO favorite dessert to be brought to the table, because my nerves need it for faking it through this and he was showing amazing restraint. I purposefully told my SO to be calm before dinner and let them run the show to see how they'll be. We talked about if it went sideways, that this is also his opportunity to cut ties with them if he chooses. So don't worry he's plenty protective, but I had him in off mode tonight lol. 

""I don't think it's wise to order that wine, and he doesn't need that cake. "" - well it ain't for you and he loves that cake. So he gets cake. 

My SO brings up a wedding we attended Via Zoom lol to lighten the mood and they made a face and.. our waiter came back with that wine at the right time and cake slice.. because you know once you open the bottle, pour, and sip it's on your tab. I only got one sip and I didnt even swallow it before that shit came out my mouth from what his parents said. ""If you have a child with my son in the future, we will not love them the same way we love our other grandchildren, because they will be half black. If marriage is in your cards with him forget it  I hope it doesn't last. We just believe that he would be happier with some one of a lighter tone of skin."" 

Our waiter hadn't even left the table so props to him for keeping that bottle steady while pouring after the bomb drop, but the face he made. His eyes wide as hell. 

All I did was look at my SO for him to just deflate, kiss my cheek, gathered his coat and my purse,  and he went to get the car without a word. It was painful for me to watch him  because I knew he was reall hurt, he loved his parents, but he didn't want to be apart of that anymore and even though we are not having children it's still a slap  to the face to hear that and disturbing. 

While I  sat there and looked at both his parents and wonder how the hell their son turned out so perfect.
I stood up because at this point, I realized I don't want to be on the same level as them, plus there is no reason to keep this quiet and if you wanna play ball like that you're going to be outed. ""For your son and I to even be in your presence is so offensive, having dinner with racist!! I cannot believe I thought you could be civil like a normal human being. I won't make that mistake again neither will he. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my time on you both and made an effort to meet you, while I could have instead treated us both to a much better dinner with company who is far superior and foward thinking than you two."" 
I picked this restaurant for a reason, it's expensive af and I had saved for this night because I had Intended on paying because  it's where we had our first lunch date and it also has that Raspberry dessert that my SO loves and I mainly wanted him to have that comfort tonight. 
""Since you so graciously offered to pay enjoy the bill and tip our black server the amount you would've tipped a Caucasian one. Because I now believe that your racism will play a part in how you tip him!"" I said this loudly and people turned their heads to look. His parents got red face, but I picked up the plate of cake and turned and walked to the door where my man was standing

I felt powerful 

I felt confident 

I felt extremely angry

I grabbed his hand 

And right when I walked out the door and it closed my legs shook, my breathing sped up, and I clung to him. We leaned on each other for support as we left and pulled off a few miles down the road to let  him have a moment to gather himself.

He broke the silence by asking for his cake. No utensils so we ate with our hands laughing, because I stole a plate from the restaurant, but he said I looked like a bad bitch doing it. After we were done we turned the car around, stopped at a bank to get a 50$, and went back to the restaurant  to return the plate and ask for our server.

It was a shit night, up until we were eating cake with our fingers on the side of the road laughing. We had known the night would have been bad, but we didn't know that those words would've been said. It has really been messing with me though.



EDIT: WOW! I did not expect this to gain so fast and its a bit overwhelming. I am reading all of your replies, but I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the comments. However, I do want you to know that I do appreciate all support that you all have given me and my SO. ❤️",1612664834.0,CoroBora,TwoXChromosomes
Frustrated by impact of society on my son.,"My son has picked up some warped sense of how things should work and it is frustrating me.  He's nine and I am guessing he's just repeating something he heard at school or something.   My husband is sitting sewing a tear in his shorts (he caught them on something and he's always too cheap to throw clothes away he can fix).

Son says to him, ""Dad why are you sewing, isn't that girl stuff?  Why isn't mom doing it?""  Angry momma was about to go set him straight when my husband just being who he is says very calmly though I could hear the slight hint of anger in his voice.

""Real men and boys sew, do laundry, cook, wash dishes, wash clothes and clean.  Whatever needs to be done.  Don't ever say something is girls work again.""

I think it was better coming from his father then me, but the fact my husband even had to say it frustrates me to no end.   My husband comes from a family where gender roles were very strictly defined and broke the mould of his mother/father/stepfather, grandparents.  I thought our son was being brought up right, with no preconceived notions of gender roles but somewhere along the line someone infected him with it!  We try to teach them right from wrong then put our kids out into the world and no matter how hard we try the cycle just seems to keep going.

Going to go out to my car to scream now.

Edit: I was not expecting this kind of response.  I was expecting it to vanish into the internet and take my frustration and anger with it.  To those who think my son is being emasculated by a fascist feminist (I've been called this because of my writing) and her  male puppet, no, he's not.  We're just trying to make sure when he grows up and decides to find a partner he's a good husband and if he ends up being a father, a good father.  We're older, hes still young, we're at the point now where either one or both us could just drop dead and we want to make sure he has a good start.  To those of you who think I might be suicidal or depressed, thank you so much for the huge amount of concern, unfortunately its misplaced, I hope when you find someone who is in real need, you're just as adamant about them getting support.",1660192561.0,kivrinjk,TwoXChromosomes
Tomorrow I am going to break up with my partner of 7 years,"Hi all. I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and some of the posts/comments actually helped me to make the above-mentioned decision. I apologise ahead for the long post.

I am 36F and I've been with my partner (36M) for almost 7 years. But tomorrow I am planning on breaking up with him. While he hasn't explicitly treated me unwell, things haven't been ideal.

When we met, I thought he was it. He was sweet, helped me out, loved my cooking, we did things together, his family is great and they have been nothing but good to me. We moved in together not long after we got official and less than a year into the relationship, he proposed. I was over the moon. He would be my forever after.

But things only started getting worse from there. He got diagnosed with autism (which I suspected anyway), he had issues at work because of his learning disability. He started putting on weight which ended up in him hurting his knee and requiring surgery. He ended up with more mental health problems and I stood by him, like a trooper, supporting my man.

But the past couple of years I have started feeling like a single mother, his mother. I've been doing all the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, reminding him the bins need taken out for collection, you name it. He's just been sitting in his ""man cave"", watching movies or playing PS5. Ive been slowly growing more and more resentful. Never mind he put on so much weight he is literally twice as heavy as me. And I'm quite a big girl myself. He has no savings, he blows his salary within a week of getting paid and then asks me to lend him money.

Reading this sub made me start realising I don't have to put up with this. I started communication my frustrations but he never took them on board. Said I just wanted to argue all the time.

When I was buying him a Valentine's day card earlier this week, I realised I didn't really feel any of those messages. My last straw was me crying in the kitchen for 20 mins on  Valentine's day night after me handed me a card, box of chocolates and told me he might be losing his job.

After I break the news to him tomorrow, I will ask him to move out. I don't know how that will go as his parents don't want him in the house. I have told his mum I am planning on doing that, as she had asked me to do it should it come to it.

Wish me luck.

ETA: It's done, it went alright, I'm safe & sound and I will be OK. I'm hoping to post a proper update in the next few days as it's still an ""evolving situation"" in terms of housing.

Thank you all for the kind comments and messages.

I'll never again date a man who can't enjoy sex with condoms,"I just ended it with yet another guy who tries to push me to try yet another birth control option. I've spent half my life struggling with side effects. Just so men can enjoy sex without a condom. 

This time he told me he didn't want to have sex if he couldn't feel it raw. He felt his dick was too little 'involved' when the condom gets in the way. I just realised how fucked up that is. My clitoris is barely even involved in PIV. There is a whole lot more between my pleasure button and PIV-action than it ever will be for his dick. 

So now I'm done. Sex without condom will only be acceptable when my pleasure button is just as involved as his, meaning no PIV. 

Sorry for the rant.

Edit: Thank you so much to every single one of you. When I wrote this post I felt a bit like a prude. Thank you to everyone for making me trust in my own boundaries, and to see that my boundaries are healthy. 
And thank you to everyone who has pointed out the STDs part of wearing condoms. I definitely need to learn to care more about my boundaries and health, than I've cared about men's sexual pleasure.

(UPDATE) Told My (28) Coworker (37M) To Fuck Off Today,"TLDR; I wanted to make a follow-up post about me and my coworker, and talk about what changed after I enforced some boundaries, but I didn't notice how bad things were until I did. 

A few weeks ago I posted here talking about how I finally told my coworker to fuck off. Doing this was a giant relief but led to me noticing just how much this guy actually did bother the fuck out of me. I didn't intend for this to be a rant, so I apologize. 


The first thing I noticed is that I am no longer absolutely fucking exhausted at the end of the day. He no longer verbally badgers me for hours, I no longer walk into the office and get  followed around and talked at before I clock in.
Sometimes, even, he'd be outside ""looking through his car"" when I'd pull up so he'd walk into the building with me, already talking my face off. 

Now I can simply walk in to the office, put my food in the fridge without having to ask him to stand aside from the fridge door, and clock in without immediately having to ""mmhm"" and ""uh huh"" my way around someone.

 

 This alone is such a quality of life improvement I've actually been giddy at work.
Additionally, but in the same vein, I do not get slack messages every 10-35 minutes, for 8 hours a day. I no longer want to throw something through a wall.

After my post, 
I immediately moved desks into another colleagues office and he actually just lets me work. 

I can do my things at my desk (music, podcast, doodling, wear headphones, whatever) while working without it being commented on or being a commandeered interest. By ""commandeered interest"" I mean I would quietly play some music at my desk and he would come over and ask me which band it was. I told him, he said he'd never heard them before, and then the next week he comes in to the office and shows me that he bought every single one of their records. A band he heard about last week. Or he'd see me doodling on a piece of paper, and I'd  come in to the office to see my entire whiteboard filled with his doodles. 


I no longer have to deal with being asked to go to get coffee with him, or go do some random thing with him. Random gifts, notes, printed memes or whatever are no longer on my desk, my whiteboard, or desktop screen anymore.

 I literally just get to come in to the office, everything is as I left it and it's not covered in evidence that he's been at my desk and in my space. 


The first day after I moved my desk, I actually got an entire year's worth of documents filed (something I've been trying to do for 6 months, but haven't been able to do because of the constant conversation or random side quest taskers like 'can you proof read my email, come with me to tech support, Yada yada) and I left work in a good mood for the first time in a long time. 

I didn't consume a coffee, a five hour, a monster energy and another coffee just to try and recharge my batteries from this fucking drain I didn't realize had such an impact on me.

 I can now make it through the work day on one cup of coffee, and no longer have to use caffeine as a coping mechanism.


Anyway, the point of this post is that I thought these were the *only* things I asked for or set boundaries with, but he also reeled back on a few things I hadn't noticed he was doing purposefully. 


He stopped parking near me, and started parking where he used to when I first started working here. This shows me that he DID park next to me on purpose.


He stopped forcing his way to walk me to my car (under the guise of walking to HIS car when I would protest.) To which I would then counter by waiting  for the other women to get ready to leave and walk with them because it was making me uncomfortable in the first place. Honestly, writing this out I now realize I was playing defense constantly. 

He stopped trying to force me in to lunches with unbelievably frustrating conversations like: 

Him: Op, want to go grab lunch?

Me: no thanks, I'm not hungry

Him: you sure? I'll buy!

Me: no thanks, I don't want you to grab me anything and I'm not hungry. 

Him: well, you can pick up some food to eat later?

Me: no thanks, I'm good.

Him: you could pick up food to bring to your partner?

Me: dude seriously, I'm good.

Or to turn lunch breaks into movie time, or come with me on walks during lunch, or asking me to drive somewhere together to pick up lunch and eat it together in his car while watching a show on his phone (when I was literally just trying to fucking escape this dude.) 

He stopped texting me while I was driving from work (after he walked to his car conveniently next to mine), memes every 20 minutes with some variation of ""haha this is SOOOOOO you"" tiktok or IG Reel or some group message from him to another Co worker talking about me in some jesting way. 


He stopped bringing me coffee, alcohol, food, sugar packets, random candles, random house shit, random office shit, random hobby shit. He stopped always having an expensive coffee (that I didn't ask for) on my desk (which is honestly huge for me, because I felt forced to accept the coffee everyone knew I liked, because if I declined and gave back the coffee, I'd have to explain the sole reason being that I did not want him to bring me shit, although I had asked him privately to stop a couple of times.)


He stopped interacting with me when unnecessary (and I realized how unnecessary it is for him to interact with me.)

 Everything is just an email now and those have slowed. I no longer get updated on his every thought and it's fucking amazing. He does still send me emails with his daily ""jobs"" or ""tasks"" that are about 17 bullet points long. Every day (there's not that much work, it's mostly mundane shit.) But I can handle that. 

All in all, I am pissed that all of these little things slid under my radar. All of these things were disguised in a friendly, convenient, coincidental way and I didn't notice until it was too late and I was crying daily for what appeared to me as ""no reason""

I wrote all of this to say: check on how you're feeling and why. There may be some things flying under your radar that make you feel drained.

I really didn't notice the things he did that bothered me, until I felt relief that he was no longer doing them.  

I also wanted to say thank you again to this awesome community for telling me I wasn't crazy and for showing support for what I was dealing with. Hopefully someone else searching for words to describe what they're going through sees this and feels some sort of relief that they're also not wrong for feeling the way they do.",1682598946.0,SolidStateStarDust,TwoXChromosomes
"The ""Trend"" of Men destroying their Girlfriend's/Wife's hobbies/food in videos isn't funny.","I've seen it so often, YES some are staged but my god the amount of men who think it's okay.

Twas the night before Christmas and my husband...,"Gave our 7 year old coke. With caffeine. I haven't wrapped any presents and was counting on him going to sleep early to give me time to wrap the kids present. 

What's even more insulting and infuriating is that just yesterday my husband and I were talking about coke and the kids and I put my foot down and said not until they're at least 10. 

So today he went and bought coke. And gave it to our kid 2 hours before his bed time. 

Any body else have tales to share on this pleasant Christmas eve....

_____________________________________________

~Christmas morning update~

Good morning lovely Reddit world and merry Christmas to all. 

Just wanted to give a little update to the consequences of my husband's actions. 

But firstly, I'm in Australia. We call cola Coke. It's just a thing. I have not done, been near or ever been inclined to do drugs so it didn't even cross my mind that a lower case ""c"" could cause such drama!

My bad. 

So. On to the update. An hour and a half after we put oldest to bed we started wrapping. My husband locked himself in our  bedroom to wrap my presents, and I got started with the kids in our living area.  

It's our usual routine. We've done it every year since our first kid. My eldest came out and almost saw everything thrown on the couches and coffee tables. 

He said he was having nightmares. He's never had nightmares before so I took it seriously. I jumped straight up,  blocked his view of the living area and scooped him in to a big cuddle and carried him back to his room. 

He described his nightmare, and as he did his dad came in. I gave him the look, (you know the one. The ""I told you so side eye"" ) and said goodnight. Hubby stayed in with him to get him settled again. 

Once my husband finished my presents, he came out and wrapped all of our youngest kids presents.

I just also need to clarify that I have been holed up in bed sick for the last week and a half which means I wasn't able to wrap everything in advance. My husband during this time was amazing. He took care of everything while I was sick. 

My husband is not a bad man. He is kind, warm, a fantastic dad. There is a lot of polarisation on this sub that seem to think no one can make a mistake without immediately resorting to divorce or abuse. 

I dont believe in that. I believe problems should be faced as a team. Decisions should be unanimous or it's a default no. 

Its never me versus him. It's me and him versus the problem. 

This has gotten us through 12 years of some pretty significant ups and downs. 

We are all human. We all make mistakes. It's how we learn. 

I can guarantee my husband learns from his mistakes and always does better. 

He got me amazing and thoughtful gifts this year. 
He hasn't always done that, but he really knocked it out of the park this year. 

I appreciate everyone's concern, contributions and input. Even the trolling ones. They have seriously enlightened me to how lucky I am to have a partner that keeps me grounded and is happy to learn from his mistakes. 

I just wanted a little Christmas eve rant! 

I'm not a control freak. I let my kids have sugar, just not 2 hours before they need to go to bed. Christmas day / morning they have the freedom to pig out on special lollies to their hearts content because we usually have so much planned they burn it all off and crash for bed. 
This was so out of left field for him I felt the need to share. 

So again, merry Christmas all, and hope you have an amazing day surrounded by people with patience, kindness and unconditional love. ",1703404026.0,bunnybumfluff,TwoXChromosomes
My friend’s doctor lied to her partner to protect her,"Note: obviously changing some details around for privacy

My friend Jane has been stuck in a frankly emotionally abusive relationship for a while. She’s been slowly working on getting everything ready to leave him - things like getting her important documents away to trusted people, finding a new place to stay, saving up enough money etc. but it’s been hard because he’s really controlling and he’ll go through all her stuff. 

But then she found out she was pregnant. There was no happiness at the news on her part. He has always desperately wanted kids with her. She never wanted kids with him. She doesn’t even want pets with him. 

I’m forever grateful that it’s relatively easy to get an abortion where we live, and I’m forever grateful for her doctor. 

Her doctor was amazing.

It’s part of the protocol here for doctors to get their pregnant patients alone and ask them about anything concerning - like abuse. It was then that Jane told her doctor about her situation and begged for an abortion. She asked her doctor to give her one secretly and lie to her partner. There was no judgement from her doctor at all. Her doctor believed her and immediately took her side. 

Jane managed to get the abortion secretly. Her doctor lied to her partner about everything the entire time. Said that Jane just needed to get some more tests done and that they were busy and it’ll take a while when Jane was really going to get her abortion done. She opted for the surgical abortion so it was really quick. 

Afterwards her doctor lied again to her partner and said that she thought Jane had already left - didn’t she leave with you? When in reality Jane was leaving with me from a different building in a different exit. 

Jane’s doctor is the reason she managed to solve her problems instead of ending up with even bigger ones. It was just so refreshing for her doctor to believe her immediately like that. No argument. No doubt. Just completely took her at her word and went above and beyond. I know if I told the people I know in real life they’d think the doctor was in the wrong for keeping it away from the man in the relationship, but I feel like people here will understand. I just feel like more doctors should be like that and be willing to take extra steps and protect vulnerable patients.",1648048689.0,someonehere8899,TwoXChromosomes

Now the ""I am not your mother"" comment may seem a bit harsh. But I had been struggling with explaining mental load to him for weeks. And I tried again in this conversation, it not landing for him again.   
Plus I already decide what we eat every other day as I do the cooking (which I am okay with btw, he does the dishes that I hate doing, so it works out). Everytime I ask him what he wants to eat that week I never get an answer. So it's on me to think what we'll have for dinner and consequently what I need for groceries. I do not mind doing these chores, and I don't mind to much being the choicemaker for homecooked dinners. But I am NOT choosing what you'll have from a fucking foodtruck, this was supposed to be the ONE time I didn't have to think for you.

I sent him You Should've Asked from Emma, I've seen you guys sharing it before, because I guess I myself just couldn't explain it well enough to him. He has autism and it's hard for him to understand certain concepts when it's not easily and clearly laid out. And he knew this concept was important to me, because I'd been trying to explain it several time, he just couldn't understand it well enough with the words I used.  
He read it the next day. The whole thing. And there is an immediate change. Instead of expecting me to have the answers all the time, he comes to me with not just the problem but also with one or two solutions and then asks me what I think. He takes more initiative when something needs be done. The other day we were making lunch together and instead of asking me if he needed to do something, he just picked something and started doing it. 

Neither of us are perfect, but we are getting there by continuously being open and honest with each other and not immediately getting mad at criticism, but working on things together.

“I don’t want to get married until you pay off your debt”,"I think this sentence right here is the beginning of the end for me. I have been through so much with this man. 
I stood by him through his divorce and understood his reasons for dating during a separation. 
He has 3 kids. I have one. We have been together almost 2 years. Living together for 3  months. 
He used to have a good savings and a 401k. Most of these were wiped out to pay for his divorce and I stood by him. I know we can rebuild together. No problem. I have accepted  that he can’t do as much for me as far as gifts and dates. No problem, I have my own money and make a bit more than he does anyways. 
That’s what unconditional love is all about right? 

So the other night I asked him what was next in our relationship? He rattled off plans and trips we had for the year. I said, no like big steps in our relationship? He mentioned my desire to own a bigger home in the future and said having a child would be put off as I just got on  birth control. Oh, did I mention he is obsessed with the idea of having a baby together? So imagine my surprise when I said, what about getting married? And he said, oh I don’t know when, I don’t want to get married until your debt is paid off anyways. 

I was shocked. Flabbergasted. He has NEVER mentioned being concerned about my car payment and student loan debt. We have talked about the plans for our future and marriage many times. This has never come up before. I have around 40k of well managed debt, a student loan and a car payment. It will all be paid off in 5 years. I will be 36 at that time. I have never been married. There is no irresponsible consumer debt whatsoever. I own a home which I rent out. I have 75k+ in assets compared to his small savings. 

I asked him what would happen if he were in an accident, since he doesn’t have medical insurance and racked up medical debt of his own? Or we’re in an accident and had to buy another car? I reminded him that his financial situation is much worse than mine and that was never off putting to me. That I would stand by him as a partner. He changed his tune and back tracked and said I just didn’t understand him but the damage had been done. 

It was ridiculous and unbelievable to me. Still is. I’m still angry. I said if he just wasn’t ready or over his last marriage I would understand. He said that wasn’t it and he wanted to remarry someday and he hoped it would be me. 

Is this reasonable? Am I crazy? Should I leave? Reeling. 

TLDR: partner says they won’t marry me until student loan and car are paid off.

The number 1 cause of death for pregnant women in the USA is homicide. [Source](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193666) (1998 study)

These two statistics go through my mind daily.

A close friend of mine was in a devastating road traffic collision in November. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, and in hospital until January. She broke 60% of all the bones in her body. Her pelvis was shattered into 6 pieces. One arm had to be completely rebuilt with metalwork as they **lost** 6 inches of bone. She had a severe head injury with a brain bleed that is permanent damage.

Before the RTC she was extremely active. A contortionist, a ballet dancer, part-time model, a fitness instructor. The day before the RTC she'd spent 8 hours rock climbing. After the collision, she had to relearn to walk. She's still on morphine daily because of the pain.

Her boyfriend has just broken up with her. In March, he told her she should 'get over it already'. 3 months after she'd woken to find her life had been irrevocably changed. When she mentioned that she was struggling with adapting mentally, and had been having some suicidal thoughts because she felt she was 'meant' to die in the RTC. Her boyfriend told her if she killed herself, he would punish her dog once she was gone so it would be her fault her dog would get tortured as she chose to die and leave her dog behind when he didn't want it.

He did brilliantly with her for the first 2 or 3 months. He was so attentive and caring, going the extra mile to make her transition to homelife as easy as possible. And then it was like a switch flicked.

I know how it is being a carer. I was an end-of-life carer for a family member for 17 years. It's fucking tough. It takes so much from you mentally and physically. I knew from day one that it would be a miracle if her bf could adapt to the new way of life because going from being an equal partner in an adult relationship to being a full-time carer to an adult is a huge adjustment. Yet none of this understanding stretches to accepting someone who would even think to threaten an animal.

My heart hurts for my friend, and I'm so angry she's another statistic.",1656960770.0,Petallic,TwoXChromosomes
"Parenting for women is a scam, a slog, and makes you a servant.","*EDIT: Wow this exploded. I want to thank everyone who has has commented so far. I especially want to thank the amazing parents who love their kids but are HONEST about what a shitty slog it is. Those moms who wish they hadn’t had kids even though you love them more than life. I see you. I get it. You are good moms. I appreciate every one of you sharing your stories!

And to the men who are all salty in my DMs; good job, here’s a cookie if this doesn’t describe you. You didn’t understand the assignment if you’re pulling the “not all men” card. The point is it happens and it happens WAY TOO MUCH. This is clearly a big problem, just look at the comments here and get your complimentary reality check.*

I had a conversation/argument yesterday with a male friend around why I didn’t want kids. I was adamant that parenting for women looks totally different than how it looks for men. I want a sanity check. 

My reasons:

1. The bar for men is so low and the judgement on women is so high. Example being: get the kid to daycare (before rushing off to work) with messy hair, mismatched socks, and a lunchbox with only a banana, yogurt, and a cookie? That’s “a flustered dad trying his best” if he’s a man, vs just a bad mom if she’s a woman.

2. Women are assumed to like being the “default parent” without any discussions. 

3. Men use “weaponized incompetence” to get out of doing kid-related activities and chores. “I don’t know where her clothes are”, “I don’t know what to feed them”, “he doesn’t cry when you change him”, “you just do it better”. Women get it done because it needs to be done, we just figure it out.

4. Women are expected to satisfy the needs of everyone else around them before enjoying themselves. I already experience this with just having company over at my house - I can’t enjoy myself until everyone else does; this pressure is turned up to 11 during motherhood. Men do not experience this pressure and are not attuned to it. This also applies to sex. 

5. Imbalance of “me time”. Dad gets to take his morning hourlong shits in peace while mom wrangles the kids. Dad gets to play video games for hours while mom struggles to put kids to bed. 

6. Inability of securing financial independence. The average family with younger kids has a man earning money and a woman being a SAHM. This is because daycare is insanely expensive, and because breastfeeding (if they are doing it) demands it. Even if she wanted to leave, she has no money to do so. It’s a trap.

7. My observations around men being much more thoughtless and clueless. I go to Disney World a lot (passholder) and I people watch *hardcore*. I watch families on their vacations supposed to be having a good time. There is no better birth control. I see men hating parenting. I see men on their phones zoned out while mom does the wrangling. I see moms trying to please everyone, trying to keep the peace, and dads just standing there. Mom wants a nice family picture, dads having a “mantrum” about it because he wants to go build a lightsaber. Yesterday I watched a family share a meal - dad was scrolling something on the phone, zoned out, blissfully eating his dinner. Mom was struggling with their toddler trying to feed them. Dad got to eat completely hot food uninterrupted, toddler got fed by mom. Mom had to box her food up to go and didn’t get to eat because they had to get to the fireworks at 8. Absolutely no initiative by dad to help. I see this constantly in different ways everywhere. Oblivious dads. 

8. Unequal division of labor, mental load bullshit. 

Honestly there is so much more but I’m burning out with all this stuff. TLDR; motherhood is awful unless you are rich and have a perfect supportive partner. I’m sure you all have plenty of your own stories to share.",1634486833.0,pinkamena_pie,TwoXChromosomes
He Hid The Hersey Bars,"My partner was in charge of getting the Halloween candy to pass out. Yesterday, I was throwing something in the trash when I saw the Halloween candy bags. He had bought a bag with Hersheys chocolate bars in it, but I hadn’t seen any Hersheys. I have trauma surrounding Hershey bars from when I was a child. Sometimes even the sight of them makes me ill so I was confused how I didn’t see a single bar. 

I asked him what happened and he simply said “I took them all out and hid them so you wouldn’t have to see them”. 

I have never felt so seen and so loved. I just wanted to share there are still good men out there! 

Edit: Man, I didn’t think I’d have to edit this post but I feel like I have to. While I’m fortunate enough to have had years of therapy to overcome my trauma mostly, not everyone else has. Yes I misspelled Hershey in the title, but it doesn’t detract from the trauma I experienced, or the reality that my partner is a wonderful human being who, without asking, made efforts to remove something he knew hurt me. I was bribed by a man with Hershey bars as a child and it makes me sad that there are people who have made light of a moment in which I felt heard and seen by my partner. Please remember there are real people behind posts and while I am not seriously hurt by people making light, I could have been. Trauma should not be a joke.

Why is Hair Pulling and Choking (aggression) in Sex the Assumed Norm w/o Consent?,"I live in a major city and am big on sex positivity. I have a very active sex life, but something that keeps coming up is that (on a first hookup) men will pull my hair and/or choke me during sex without asking first. Every time this happens it blows my mind.

In 2019 I had sex with one of the sweetest, most soft spoken, feminist-minded guys. When it came to sex he pulled my hair without consent. Afterwards we were chatting about sex and I asked him, ""Why did you do that without asking?"" He seemed genuinely stunned. He immediately apologized and owned that he took a liberty and he would think more on it. I realized I really hate having my head yanked or touched aggressively during sex, especially by people I've just met/first encounter.

Fast forward many hookups later, it continues. A recent hookup decided to choke me while I was coming. Afterwards I explained to him how he decided for me that that would be what I'd want, and that that sort of behavior needs consent every time. He mentioned a lot of girls dont prefer to be asked. Again my mind was blown. How could taking an aggressive liberty be the norm? Isn't that just like a massive risk? I said to him, ""Remember when I was going down on you and I asked if you like your balls sucked and you said no?"" He said, ""Yes."" I said, ""Wasn't it nice that I asked?"" he stared blankly. ""What if without asking, I decided what would have been super hot is if i just aggressively grabbed your balls?"" I could see the gears turning in his head.

I don't often wait till after to remark. Nowadays I actually bring this up in convo before any sex takes place...but get this. IT STILL HAPPENS. I have in depth conversations with men about how I dont enjoy my hair pulled, or being choked by new partners. I then meet up, and they proceed to go for my neck or yank my hair. I have told many men in the moment ""I don't like my hair pulled."" And their reaction is always, ""Wait really?"" Like they're shocked. I say, ""Yup. It's not for me."" a few minutes go by and their hand finds its way to my neck; it's frightening.

So. I think that this is part of a larger issue I've been noticing. A handful of men are self-identifying as ""doms"" in lieu of an authentic sexual style that leaves room for our humanity. When you are afraid of intimacy being a ""dance"" or an interaction between two people, you don't leave any room for the other to reject you... enter: tons of men now self-identifying as doms with zero education on the matter. PSA: Being a dom isn't just force feeding your cock to a stranger, yanking her hair and making her tell you she's yours without consent. From my experience it seems like many men feel the need to be aggressive just out of avoiding actual vulnerability. In particular, the incessant hair pulling/choking that has happened to me in recent years on casual encounters without my consent has shocked me and continues to.

Most women I know have at least one sexual assault/abuse story. I do, and I know smart men know the statistics. How then are we deciding the norm is that it's okay to choke and yank head's of people we're just starting out with, without their consent? Thankfully I haven't been too triggered but it still really ruins the sex for me, just by observing the total misattunement of me and the interaction. It's a huge red flag being waved saying: I don't see you as a person with a history or your own wants/needs. Actually the thought didn't even cross my mind. I just thought this would be hot and right now you're my sex doll.

I just wanted to rant and see if anyone else has had this same experience. Or to any guys out there who take any physical aggressive liberty without consent: why? How would you feel if I decided to be aggressive with your head, penis, balls, or any other part of you without asking first?

To any women who love being choked or having your hair pulled, you rock! I do not yuck your yum at all! Just not for me and I'd like consent and established trust before physical aggression becomes a part of the sex for me.

**Edit:** WOW, this blew up. I want to thank everyone for reading and commenting because I think my main purpose in writing this was to dialogue about it. So just by discussing it I am a happy camper. I appreciate all of the men in this thread who are sharing their open and honest experiences. Thank you for responding and engaging. I am in solidarity to all my female identified friends who have sadly endured this as well. I do in fact engage in this exact conversation one on one with guys on apps, but because it's been so persistent I wanted to take a temperature check on a larger platform. So thanks reddit for showing up.

To those wrestling with the idea of ""where is the line"" and ""most women do not want me to ask"", I hear you! I firmly believe that as women if we expect men to pursue 100% of the time that that co-creates and contributes to a culture of assault and rape. Men, you ARE allowed to get it wrong! I do not want men to feel like they need to be mindreaders. I also get that ya'll have tons of pressure on you to just ""know"" and I sympathize with that. GGG to me is about a willingness to learn someone and communicate, not just ""know.""

And women speak up! Do not get annoyed with men for ensuring consent! I tried to illustrate that I am not suffering in silence but am more appalled that its the standard with specifically, physically aggressive behavior, or continues to happen even after a conversation has been had. I repeat: my issue is with specifically, physically aggressive behavior. And to the men who feel its justified, again, I ask what is something that if done to you would really hurt or take you out of the sex? And to women who love this w/o consent, what is something you require consent on that if done as the norm without it would really bother you? Empathy!

Anyone in the comments saying this is what I get, I hope ya'll can be more compassionate towards yourselves and improve the quality of the sex you are having. I love my sex life, I'm engaged with it, and while there are plenty of impasses that occur I believe in living in a space of vulnerability AND I believe I am deserving of not being physically aggressed without my consent. Those two things can co-exist.

Anyone vanilla shaming or kink shaming needs to look inward. There is no ONE right way to have sex. Connect in the moment with the person you're playing with. Educate yourselves on the variety of ways sex can be enjoyed. It's rather juvenile to think spanking, slapping, choking, and hair pulling is the automatic ""cool"" thing. What is cool is allowing sex to be an interaction where you discover someone in real time, letting the interaction have an open dialogue, and making it a safe space for both to explore to maximize pleasure.

**Edit 2:** A lot of comments are remarking on how I should expect this if having casual sex. Two things.

1. This happens beyond casual sex; I've had this happen with a dude I went on 16 dates with before sleeping with him, and he wasn't the only one. What is your response to this conversation then?
2. Raise YOUR standards. I'm not a blubbering idiot who cannot decipher differences between varying levels of relational dynamics. I'm well aware that the less you've known someone the more room for impasse to occur. You're asking me to resign to that fact and never bring it up (I have a voice and will use it), or to stop having casual sex altogether as if there is a magical threshold of knowing someone where this particular impasse simply wont occur anymore and keep me safe. That mindset is narrow and juvenile. Be mindful that when you shame folks for having casual sex you're perpetuating a culture that negatively impacts you as well, even if you feel safely married for 20+ years. Believing that communication is unsexy, believing that there are certain scenarios that invite bad sex and others that dont, believing that there are norms that don't require consent, this all contributes to a false sense of control and a righteousness that if you ""do the right thing"" you will not endure sexual impasse. Sexual impasse can occur between anyone! Plenty of married friends of mine have told me about horrible sexual experiences with their spouses. My plea is to emphasis the need for consent no matter the context. When you declare that this is expected in casual sex you're moralizing sex which has harmful effects on everybody, including yourself whether you're conscious of it or not. Plenty of people are also cheating on apps (I get hit up by them a lot); when we sexually repress ourselves and our partners we all pay a price. Dialogue and consistent improvement are the way. Do better.

**Edit 3**: One last PSA while I have the mic!

Many are talking about this being a norm amongst teens citing it trending on Tik-Tok. Whether you're a teen or an older vet in the realm of sex and intimacy, **please do what feels good for you.** No matter how you identify, the next time you're hooking up with someone ask yourself: do I like this? Does this feel good? Am I enjoying myself? Too many folks engage in intimacy in a systematic, disconnected, one-size-fits-all way. I fully understand this is a co-created issue and I do not blame just het-cis men. We all need to check in with ourselves more and ask: do \*I\* like this? Please be intuitive to yourself and do not subscribe to ideas about sex based on what other people say works for them or is ""cool."" What's cool is being authentic to yourself. What's cool is letting sex be an unfolding dance of discovering someone else's humanity. 

IT'S OKAY TO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING, but please talk to friends, read online, seek support from a therapist, and ask your partner(s). If you happen to think you're kinkier than you previously thought, read up on it! Don't let your interest stop on Tik-Tok, educate yourself and really ensure its a good fit. Getting consent is KEY and a fundamental of any BDSM play.

Is it not realistic or healthy to want a boyfriend who votes for women's rights? I live in Kansas and got dumped because I told my bf I was disappointed he didn't vote on Aug 2nd. I feel lost.,"I assumed since he 100% supports abortion rights that he would tell me he simply forgot or didn't have time, and told him how easy it was for me to register and vote. Apparently he thought about it and decided not to.

It turns out his family is a bunch of Trump lovers who he says always nag him to vote (for the GOP) and get upset when he doesn't, and they implied he's a baby-killer for not voting on Aug. 2. So he feels I'm the same as them.

I was a little shocked. I don't understand how he can equate me to them. I said, if the vote passed, he could get me pregnant, I could have complications and even die. He said, yeah but that didn't happen and the vote didn't pass, so...

It's not about team Democrat vs team Republican for me, this is something that directly affects my life. I asked him if he thought he would have decided to vote if he was a woman and it directly affected him too. He ignored the message for 5 days, and dumped me when I begged for a reply.

I'm so sick and tired of dating men who don't understand or seem to care about women's rights in this country. They'll pander to whatever your beliefs are until shit gets real, and it turns out it's literally not worth their time to even think about.

Boyfriend broke up with me after 7 years together…,"Because I’m not “house-wifey” enough for him. I work a full-time job with an hour long commute and wake up at 4:30 every morning, and he works at home. He is upset that I don’t come home after work and cook a meal for him that’s big enough to also have leftovers that he can then eat the next day for lunch. Mind you, he always just eats frozen meals for lunch because he can’t be bothered to cook for himself. 

He had the audacity to tell me that I should just put a pot roast in a crock pot before I leave for work at 5am, then he can be home to make sure it doesn’t burn (literally meaning make sure the house doesn’t catch fire, not actually checking the food temperature). Like WHAT!? Put the damn thing in yourself if you think it’s not that big a deal!! 

He grew up in a different country with a different culture, where his mom and dad both worked full time, but his mom still cooked for the entire family of 7, so he doesn’t understand how I can’t just do it for the 2 of us. I had to be the one to remind him that he also had TWO LIVE-IN housekeepers/maids AND his mom worked from home. 

While I don’t disagree that someone should definitely be cooking and it’s not healthy or financially wise to order out every night, why is it my sole responsibility? Oh, right, because I’m a woman…

Anyway, I’m now sitting on my brand new bed that I built myself, in my new gorgeous townhome, not having shed a tear this entire time, wondering why I just didn’t do this sooner myself! 

I refuse to apologize for being a career-oriented woman, and not living up to societies roles for me. Now I’m going to cook for myself because I WANT TO, not because I need to fulfill my “womanly duties” for a man that doesn’t respect my value or needs.

No! Men DO NOT and SHOULD NOT have a say in a woman's abortion! Jesus Christ that we even need to talk about!,"Just been back from a guy who said exactly that.

""If the woman wants an abortion, the man usually has no say in it at all, which makes him a lesser parent automatically. I'm not sure how to do that differently but I think it's kind of messed up that it is that way.""

Honestly; while the topic of abortion is very complicated (and I'm not going to start a debate on it, because that'll only end in war) -why the fuck do some men still jump around this topic?

""Oh hey. I know that the woman I fucked will carry all responsibilities, health issues, changes for 9months and has to risk her life in a painful labour that could -even today! - kill her, but hey, I just want a kid y'know""

You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years. You don't get a say because you don't have to go through the shit a woman has to go through!

# EDIT 2.0 PLEASE READ THIS SHIT BEFORE YOU SPAM MY INBOX FULL OF THE SAME 3 OPINIONS!

So, I had a lot of people confide in me, that the reason I have this war in the comments is because I phrased it bad. Which...yes, I see how this happened. Therefore, I made a final re-edited list of all the things I have to say. If you answer anything after that I'm not going to respond anymore. 

1.) When I said ""men SHOULD NOT have a say in a woman's abortion!"" I don't mean you can't issue your opinion/ concerns or values as the father of the child/bystander.

What I meant was: You cannot & should not be able FORCE a woman to carry your child.  
Women already have big problems with wanting their tubes tied, because ""what would your (future) bf/husband say"", or getting rejected from doctors because of sexism (for those stories, just browse the rest of this sub).  
They shouldn't also need to collect a form of ""stamp of approval"" before getting one. Y'know, like ""you must have this item to pass the gate"" style.

If you are in a relationship which is not abusive -of course, talk to your partner. Women have the final say, because they carry most of the burden physically & mentally, but getting an abortion behind your partner's back is still an asshole move.

On the opposite: You can't force a girl to get an abortion, if she doesn't want to.

2.) On the topic of child support:

I mostly agree that men should be able to walk away from it all, if they don't want to raise a child.  
There are commenters who rightfully pointed out that there are places where child support is necessary (aka woman has no access to safe abortions & generally gets screwed over more), but regarding I did this with a...okay, there are also places in the west where women have no access to safe abortions. So let's...ehm...let's rather focus on getting more legal Planned Parenthoods & co.

3.) On the topic of abortion per se:

As much as I aimed for it with such a title; this is not a place to discuss the ethics of abortion. It always boils down to your personal subjective opinion, your religion and otherwise. Please.

4.) Same goes for meandering topics like military, politics & co.  
Let's at LEAST keep it on topic.

5.) Though more rare; yes. I KNOW that transmen & nb people can get pregnant too. But please. This is not a ""woke"" debate. It was a rant I had over a guy and I'm not a person that likes to get into meander territory, because I already have a tendency to meander.  
However, same rules apply to you of course.

6.) Guys, these ""if a woman don't want to get pregnant, she just shouldn't have sex"" comments are so bad American sex-ed tapes.  
We all know that there is something that can go wrong during sex & pregnancy. Birth control can fail. Sex is not ""just"" for making kids (it's designed for it, but you also don't use a spoon to eat soup, right?), a fetus can become deformed, a woman could have been pressured into sex, doesn't have the recourses...there are a lot of reasons.

Of course, abortion is not a ""quick fix"". And most women don't use it as a ""second birth control"" to ""whore around"" -get this shit out of your system please.  
However, we can all agree that abortions won't stop when make it illegal. We'd only stop SAFE abortions. So let's do the most objectivley progressive thing and try to create better circumstances for young women to get & raise their babies, while also allowing them to terminate them. Call it a ""necessary evil""if you must.

And lastly:

7.)Thanks but...no. I don't ""hate men"".  
Yes, this was a very aggressive rant, but no, I did not ""sexist"" against anyone on purpose (cookie for the user who gets the reference).  
With ""You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years"" I made a reference to all the stories of men that -unintentionally or not - leave child raising mostly to the mother, or think doing the bare minimum makes them a good Dad.   
These Dads/ in general; a lot of men often don't see the other side -the side of the mother - and therefore have a bit of an watered-down perspective on pregnancy & labour.  
Stuff like ""it's just 9months"" or ""yeah, labour is bad, but have you ever got a kick into the balls?"" (not opening a pain-olympics here).

I am so fed up with being held to a higher standard when it comes to housekeeping,"I’m working a boatload of overtime right now. My partner is in full agreement of me taking on this extra work and has done more around the house/with the kids. 

On Tuesday, he asked me if we could host his family for the weekend as it’s Thanksgiving here. I wasn’t sure and reminded him that I was working all week plus a part day Saturday, and then back to work for another 5, busy 12 hour 7-7 day shifts, so part of Sat and all day Sun was my only time off. He said that while he’d like my help with meal planning and cooking on Sunday, he’d take care of the cleaning, shopping, meal prep, organization etc. I agreed, on the condition that he also did all the after-guest cleaning on Monday.

The house isn’t guest clean. It’s “2 working parents on a weeknight” clean. He mopped, but didn’t do a good job vacuuming first so there’s bits of dried dust streaked across the floor. The windows and mirrors are streaky. The laundry basket was on the coffee table with clean laundry, there’s a bit of cat fur on the couch, I don’t think the guest bedrooms were vacuumed, the fridge has crumbs, etc.

 I didn’t tell him this, I didn’t complain to him because if we didn’t have guests it would be fine

But I just got a text from his aunt asking if my mental health is okay because she’s never seen my house this messy. Last night when I got home his mom made a comment along the lines of, “I sure can tell you’ve been putting work first lately!” and his dad and uncle cracked “jokes” about how I’m slacking because the whiskey glasses they like were dusty from months of sitting on the shelf (I would anticipate their use and dust them before they come).

So I’m fuming. Nobody said anything to him. They know he took a few days off last week. They know I’m busy working.

Why are women expected to be cleaner and tidier? Why are we held to a higher standard?

This is all bullshit.",1696692001.0,BearEatsBlueberries,TwoXChromosomes
Car buying/selling is the worst as a woman,"My partner and I decided that with the birth of our daughter we had to get a grown up car.. This involved selling his boy toy, my project classic car (I cried a little) and my daily driver to get a family car.

He sold his in ten minutes at market price. My classic (a 1971 celica) is quite rare in the condition it is in. It took over a week, being called a fat slag, that I don’t know what I’m talking about, being low balled a million times, Facebook slander etc. Until my partner took over and sold it to the second person that saw it at the price I wanted. Note here that I’m a bit of a car enthusiast so I knew what I was talking about.

My daily driver, two weeks and the same thing. He sold it for me in the end as well.

we then found the car we wanted, it’s two hours away and we need a loan  to supplement the price which isn’t an issue. I was sorting it out. And guess what! They took deposit, delivery cost, loan applications and guaranteed delivery for yesterday. they then failed to deliver it and didn’t answer my calls and have been screening my calls since! So my partner rings them and they give him a perfect update, apologies and commit to delivering today. 

I’m really sick of sexist pigs in the automotive industry.

Update: they called my partner again to say it’s been delayed due to a part until at least Thursday. I called them back and asked why they wouldn’t speak to me. They said it’s because I’m so upset they didn’t want to. I explained that I am the one buying the car, not him. The ‘manager’ refused to apologise at ignoring me stating that he didn’t want to talk to me if I’m going to be like that.",1628515663.0,Turndiall,TwoXChromosomes
THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY,"I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.
I wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.
This is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.

If you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!


**PEE AFTER SEX**
Peeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.








**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**
People make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.
But I'm happy to say, it's not!
It's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.
Don't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. 
If it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.








**Your vagina is self-cleaning**
Vaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. 
The vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.
Using water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.











**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**
The vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.








**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**
The optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. 
Semen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.
Because of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.
If you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.
The best way to deal with this is using a condom.

EDIT:
Lubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.
Many popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.

- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.
- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.
- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.

Thank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!
Here's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide






**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**
Can't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!
The vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!
Don't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.
Your pleasure is just as important as theirs.






**Most women don't bleed their first time**
In some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.
Only 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.
Bleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.
Quick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her ""virginity"" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!







**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**
There have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.
Like the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.
The truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.
The hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.
Please don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.
There's help out there for women who need to prove their ""virginity"" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.
Virginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.

EDIT:
Thank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:

""While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.""

This is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.






**Having large labia minora is normal**
Labiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is ""abnormal"".
It isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a ""right"" way for a vulva to look. 
There's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.
Please be safe!








**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**
It's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!
That being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. 








**You can get pregnant during your period**
It's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.
Once inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. 








**The vagina does not become ""loose"" if you have alot of sex**
Ever wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a ""loose"" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!
This is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. 
Virginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.
The vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.






**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**
I had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.
My mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.
She explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.
There's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.






**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**
This annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.
This is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.
To clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.
Sex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.




**Vaginal discharge 101**
I used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)

Discharge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.
Your vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.
Some of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.
I do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. 

**Healthy/Normal discharge**
The color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.
[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.

*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:

- Watery/Clear

- Gel-like ""stringy"" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.

- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.

Your discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)
This is called spotting.
Spotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.
This kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.

**Abnormal discharge**
First of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.

Cottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)

This can often signify a yeast infection.
Especially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:

- Genital Itching 

- Swelling

- Redness 

- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex

- Your discharge might smell a little ""off"" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.


TREATMENT:
If it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.

Otherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)
If your symptoms persists, book an appointment.

Don't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.

To reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: 

- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.

Avoid:

- Tight-fitting pantyhose

- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection

- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons

The following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:
- Stress

- Diabetes

- Use of birth control pills

- Pregnancy

- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days




Alot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.
A slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.
Remember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
That's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.

Lime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]
(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)
And [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)
If you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.

Symptoms of trichomoniasis:
- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals

-Discomfort with urination

-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell

Symptoms of gonorrhea:
- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour

- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing

- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)

- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.

If your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.

What is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.

Symptoms:
- Grey-like discharge

-Discharge have a strong fishy odor

- Burning feeling when you pee

- Itching

50% of women do not have any symptoms.

When to see a doctor:

-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.

- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.

- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.

- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.






**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**
TSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.
This can affect both men, women and children.
Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.
Having your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:

- A high temperature

- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough

- Feeling and being sick

- Diarrhoea

- A widespread sunburn-like rash

- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red

- Dizziness or fainting

- Difficulty breathing

- Confusion

TSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.

So apparently I ruined a perfectly happy relationship,"So one of my neighbor tells me her live-in male partner is getting extra overtime which results in her doing more domestic duties. But she can’t blame him, right? He’s working harder for “them.”

So I ask where all that extra money is going & she doesn’t see any of it or have a say on how it’s spent. I point out that “they” are working harder for “them” if she isn’t getting a reduced bills or that money isn’t being deposited/invested in something with both their names. His labor = overtime, her labor = free.

I guess she took it to heart & they ended up in a fight. She told her SO that she shouldn’t have to pay half the bills AND do extra unpaid work to accommodate him making more money. He tried to sell her the “one day maybe possibly if we get committed this will benefit you too” narrative. But he gets guaranteed tangible short-term (paycheck) & long-term (Social Security & 401k contributions) while she’s supposed to sacrifice for a potential promise.

Apparently she stuck to her guns, they now have a chore tracking sheet & she’s deducting extra chores from shared bills (NOT $1 per chore as he wanted either, lol.)

So the SO has the gall to tell me off. Says were perfectly happy before I opened my f’n mouth. (Yeah, he was perfectly happy to have her subsidize him with free labor.) Tells me he “was gonna” maybe propose soon, was “thinking” about using that OT money to buy an engagement ring but because of me he probably won’t.

I say if he “was gonna” he likely would’ve. And an engagement ring is a gift. How you gonna sucker someone in subsidizing a purchase of your choice then put a bow on it & say it’s a gift?

Now I get dirty looks from him when his GF comes over for coffee on my deck 😁 She’s early 20’s & isn’t even tryna marry this guy right now, referring to living with him as a “test drive.” Tells me he’s being a mopey baby cuz has to share rewards. He’s also tried dumping ALL domestic duties on her plus add new ones (ie 3 meals a day, dictate a cleaning schedule for her) but she explained that she wants a partner NOT an employer when paid or a teenage son when working for free. And no, she’s not living in his trash.

I admire her actions & tenacity.
I really wish someone had talked to me like this when I was that young, but honestly I don’t know that I had that courage & confidence.

EDIT
Wow I got some hateful DMs off of this one.

Apparently there’s ALOT of dudebros out there who feel entitled to have their dreams subsidized by women & girls’ unpaid, unappreciated labor. Like really take it personally that women would rather do something else with their lives than play mommy for them.

The pleasure gap ruins another relationship,"Been dating this guy for a couple months and it's been going all right he's nice and sweet. Very into sex and wanting to have sex constantly, which I like too, but a very important aspect to my enjoyment is oral stimulation. And he's been I guess not overly interested but just avoidant and saying he's ""not very good at it"" while still wanting to get head blah blah blah I've been working up with him about it. Yesterday, he just straight up told me (after I made him cum from a blowjob) he doesn't like to do it and doesn't want to do it and I don't have to give him head anymore. And I guess that's supposed to be the end of it? Nope. My pleasure is important and him kind of brushing off the situation until I made it an issue he had to address kind of makes me even more mad. It's just immature and it makes me feel like he thinks I'm dirty or something which I'm not I'm very clean. Sorry that I want to cum and your cock can't do that on its own. So basically sucks to be a woman and have to deal with the problem you won't know exists until you've already been sleeping with a guy that he doesn't care about your pleasure. And not even enough to have a decency to tell you early but make you have to pull it out of them because he knows he should be ashamed about misleading me when he wanted me to do it for him. I mean yeah I'm definitely never sucking his dick again but I'm probably just never going to sleep with him again and find someone who does value my needs. Anyway rant over

My ex-boyfriend ended our relationship because he didn't like wearing a condom,"My (F27), now ex, boyfriend (M29) of 8 months, broke up with me last week. He was my first boyfriend and my first sexual experience. When we started having sex I asked him to wear a condom, initially he said he didn’t want to as ‘it doesn’t feel as good’ I stood my ground and said nothing would happen unless he wore one and he did. Over time each time we had sex he would say he wanted to do it raw and I would say no. One time he tried to put it in and I had to squirm and push him off as he tried. He sulked and got dressed. Eventually I let him go in a couple of times with the promise of him putting on a condom after. I told him afterwards that while it may have felt good for him, I couldn’t enjoy it and it felt better for me knowing he had a condom on. 
I am not on birth control because of health reasons, and I haven’t needed until now, he told me once that he didn’t want me to go on it either. 
The reason he broke up with me was because he didn’t think we were sexually compatible. And he didn’t like that I would make him wear a condom. 
I’ve been upset this past week as aside from the issues with condoms he was a caring and kind partner. But the more I’ve reflected on our relationship I’ve come to see that he didn’t care about me, not really, not if I couldn’t meet his needs. 
I asked him to do one thing, wear a condom, and he wouldn’t. I think I need to keep reminding myself of that. He wasn’t willing to forgo a small loss of sensation to get himself off to reassure me that I wouldn’t get pregnant. He thought that needs of sexual gratification was greater than the risk of getting me pregnant. 

We met through mutual friends, and I’ve yet to see any of them since he broke up with me. The chances of us seeing each other are slim but I’m unsure what he will have told them about our break up. I know that if I’m asked I’m going to call him out on the condom issues. I felt during our relationship that I couldn’t share with my friends what was happening as when they saw us together he was always very sweet and caring towards me and he made me feel like it wasn’t a big deal after our sexual encounters. 

I think I just needed to get this out to help me get over the relationship. I keep focusing on the good times we had together and getting upset but I need to remind myself that he wasn’t a good guy.",1711904442.0,Prestigious-Chair-78,TwoXChromosomes
Why do women put up with so much sh*t?,"I’m on several different mom/baby/woman focused subreddits and sometimes I get completely overwhelmed by how much insane sh*t women put up with from their partners. 
I know that Reddit is a skewed test group and that a lot of people come here specifically to ask advice about crazy situations. Still. It’s insane. It’s not like “normal” relationship stuff it’s “my partner clearly doesn’t care about me at all but I want to make it work” stuff 
And listen, 0 shade to anyone. I know that there is a plethora of reasons why someone would want/choose/feel safer staying with these types of parters. It just makes me unfathomably sad. 
Especially the posts where women genuinely think their partners abhorrent behavior is normal. 
We have to do better as parents and a society to raise our boys better and to truly give our daughters the skills and emotional support to know they should never put up with such horrible behavior. 
There isn’t really a point on this post I’m just sad about it. 

Edit: wow thanks for the great discussions! It’s good to see that so many people recognize how crappy these situations are and the discourse around it. Though they aren’t always happy conversations the solidarity is nice to see. I have however seen several people comment about how these posts aren’t indicative of “most” relationships. I just want to say that, the point of my post was not that I thought/think all men or all relationships are bad. The post is about having empathy for women who have been or are in bad situations or think they are in good situations and for unfortunate reasons are unable to see their partners red flags, and being sad about it.

Imagine living in a world like this and believing society, or Western society at least, has actually become ""crazy feminist"" or ""misandrist"" because ""I have to hold the door open for a girl and give her my seat on the train!!!"" that literally nobody has told you or requires you to do. Or because women have greater freedom to pursue a career choice of their choosing. Or because women can get dates on Tinder and have greater control over their own sexuality than before (had a guy once tell me apps like Tinder and Bumble were 'de-purifying women' and needed to be shut down by the government). 

Then we have movements like #MeToo, where these assholes get pissy that women come together to talk about and draw attention to their problems more and more in a manner they don't, so they demonize and sabotage the benefits of the movement (countries like Russia, Hungary etc decriminalizing domestic violence because of 'radical feminism', running scare campaigns to not hire women in the US because they might cry rape when someone looks at them, which could be a contributing factor to the falling employment) and then use the existence of the movement itself as a means of saying women have these unspecified 'special privileges'. We saw the same thing with BLM last year, when the right quickly demonized them as violent thugs and opportunistic looters looking for special handouts instead of an oppressed and beaten down group of people peacefully marching for justice. And then they ran campaigns on it, and a year later we've seen 0 police departments get any serious reductions in budget as police killings continue unabated.

"Halp, my husband has an aggressive way of asking me questions and it’s making me crazy.","(Edit— i have rewritten the title below to clarify the tone a little bit to say that this is not a dire situation, but that this is causing me some distress and I’d like to hear how folks have dealt with similar issues with their spouse.)

Redo: Ugh, my husband has an obnoxious/rude way of asking me questions and it’s making me crazy.

And edit- before you read this, I wanted to say thanks for all the passionate comments but as far as Divorce goes, that’s not something I’m considering right now. I do appreciate insights and experiences tho! But just saying straight up divorce him isn’t quite the help i was hoping for. And definitely, Counseling is an option, but I’m treading carefully because of some past therapy experiences that were not helpful.

Also, this post is not about attacking my husband’s character— he is a good person with many wonderful qualities — so in that respect, I’m not interested in changing him, I just really need help with trying to alleviate some toxic habits that I’m not even sure he is fully aware of.

So:
I’m not sure when exactly this happened in my marriage of over 25 years but simple questions seem to have fallen out of my husband’s vocabulary. Instead of asking something like “Hey, can I turn off the oven now ?” he will say “Is there a REASON the oven is still on?” It’s not the question so much, that can be reasonable— it’s the tone and how demanding or accusatory the questions are.

Or instead of “Can you please pay that bill?”  he’ll ask “Is there a *reason you haven’t paid that bill?” 
Or some other examples (and there is a notation there because he always empathizes the word “reason”) and something so mundane seems to be made into such a big deal.
“Is there a *reason the shed key is not in the drawer?”
“Is there a *reason you didn’t fill the gas tank?”
“Is there a *reason you are getting on the freeway?”
“Is there a *reason you haven’t called them yet?”
“Is there a *reason you haven’t listened to the voicemail?”
“Is there a *reason we are out of cereal?”
(Not asking these questions in a row of course, just to clarify, this is over time.)

It’s all verrry frustrating to me because each of these questions could be asked with a simple Where, what, why, how-come question with a casual tone vs the pointed way he asks OR with a polite request or just a simple  reminder, like, “Hey can you please get gas?”, or “Looks like we need cereal.”

I never know how to answer! It feels very defensive to explain.  Lately I’ve just been saying “Why YES. There is a reason.” And then I don’t say anything else unless he follows up. But he doesn’t really get sarcasm, so that’s not a long-term solution.

I tried telling him this bothers me and can he please just ask me the question in a normal way, like “Honey, have you seen the shed key?” but he says it’s just a choice of words and I’m making too big a deal. I’m an HSP so words matter to me, as does tone and body language. (Edit— HSP is a kind of temperament and it stands for Highly Sensitive Person. It’s not about being emotional, it just means you notice a lot of details in your environment and can get overwhelmed by stimuli.) 

So then I tried asking some simple questions with HIS delivery, to him, to see how that went. It was not well-received.  I was like “Is there a *reason you are taking this route? It’s full of potholes.” He got really pissed and said if he’s driving, he can take whatever route he likes. Then at home instead of the usual “Hey, can you please take out the garbage?” I said, “Is there a *reason you didn’t take out this garbage?” Also didn’t go well. (“Because I’ve been busy with my JOB. And commitments. You can do it too, you know.” ) 

I didn’t point out my experiment with using his own word choice because I’d risk the argument where he says how I “always want to be right.” Buuuut the thing is, I  DON’T care about always being right, it’s just that I don’t want to feel like I’m always wrong either or being scolded. It feels very parent-child.

I’ve tried to say how this phrasing puts me on edge but he has told me several times I’m being too sensitive, or that choice of words is his prerogative to ask me things in a way that is most direct. But to me, this seems more of an indirect, passive aggressive thing! Thoughts? This is my first post ever so please be kind—or also, if this is the wrong forum, just lmk, thanks!

Edits: Wow, many thanks to y’all for your advice and passion! This was my first-ever post, after just lurking and reading posts for awhile now.  I’m so glad to have heard from this community. You shared stories, recommendations, frustrations and words  of wisdom, and honestly, I’m blown away!! I tried to reply at first, but then I couldn’t keep up! I’m looking forward to hearing about people’s experiences and reading more comments, thanks so much!

I thought I’d share few more details and answer a couple questions maybe. 

Probably the number one thing people wondered was why stay? Why not get divorced? If I felt things were on the brink in any way, i would definitely help myself and my children by leaving but this is not the case. I think my husband is a great dad, a hard worker, a good citizen, a good son, and has been a supportive partner for me. I was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago, and he was a rock of support, and for that I’m grateful. Cancer makes you rethink priorities and i just see my life as better and more full with him than without him. 

So why does he sound like such a douche? Well he has moments where he sounds like a total tool, yes, and I wish I could help him find a filter sometimes. But context is important, and this issue presented today is just a snippet that reflects a frustration—wanting him to communicate respectfully— but that is not the whole picture because 25 years is a long time, and there are both good and bad days packed in there. Each of us takes the marriage seriously, cares about the other, and neither of us has brought up divorce or separation or used that against the other. 

We have different personalities and  communication in general has never been our strong suit, it generally feels as if we are on different wavelengths. But there are many reasons to stay and work on our marriage. My husband has a good heart and an interest in doing what is right. He has never ever hit me or physically hurt me or the kids or pets— never thrown a plate, slammed a door or punched a wall or threatened me or called me names, nothing even close. He is not an alcoholic, or a substance abuser or a cheater or a liar or a gambler. He’s very responsible and a good employee. We love each other’s families very much, and feel lucky that our in-laws are great people and role models. No one on either side has divorced, parents and grandparents included. So we have taken our vows seriously and after 25 years, both of us think we want to stick it out. 

The questions in my post were from my “Ick list”, which is what a therapist recommended I write down, not only to stop ruminating but also if we ever went to couples therapy, i would have a reference sheet and not get steamrolled. These examples were not things he said rapid fire, they are not from the same episode, they were discussions or questions that cropped up over the years. It’s easy for someone to seem like a douchey monster without context.

We have two amazing kids together, and they are almost grown. I’m hoping that as they start their adult lives, my husband and I can work on ourselves and be better examples. Staying together rather than abandoning ship has been a commitment to myself, my husband and to them. As the parent who stayed home with them, I feel I’m about to start a new chapter for myself too, after over two decades of child-rearing— I think I’d  like go back to school or get an advanced degree . In facing the prospect and stress of school, I’d definitely like the support of my partner. And retirement is not that far around the bend for us. We finally have a some hobbies and interests in common we both enjoy, so that gives me hope for retirement, like it seems like a prospect I can at least imagine. 

I’ve been educating myself on topics like verbal abuse, emotional abuse, high conflict personality styles and gaslighting. I’m finding great comfort and feeling like a stronger and more aware person in learning strategies, especially helpful has been listening to Dr. Ramani on YouTube. She is awesome , I highly recommend her, she’s a great speaker & teacher and seems like a very genuine person.

Thank you all for the books and resources  you have recommended!  I’ll be looking into those and reading the comments for days and weeks to come! Again, your response has been so amazing and helpful and I appreciate the thought and energy you put into reaching out!",1642097055.0,paulala343,TwoXChromosomes
It is better to be alone than with a bad partner,"I am 45 year old single woman with no kids so bear that in mind.    But I see a lot of relationship posts on here and some of the advice I see is 'There are better men out there.""  Sure.  This is true. I know many, many good men out there.  I have wonderful male friends who are supportive partners and great humans.

BUT

I think this misses a big point.  No partner at all is still better than a bad partner. 

As a single woman with no kids, I live my life for me. Sure I'm responsible for all the financial decisions.  (Sometimes I wish I could blame some of them on someone else.) and for supporting myself, but I would rather spend the rest of my life doing this than with a partner who tells me that I'm not good enough.  Or can't clean up after themselves.  Or spends all day playing video games  or whatever story it is this week.  

Friends, don't stay because you're afraid of what is out there.  It is just fine being single.

"My ex just told me to ""get a damn boyfriend"" so our daughter will stop hating going to his place","My heart hurts. I just had to pry my 11yo daughter's arms from around me while she cried ""Don't make me go!""

I sat her dad down (not for the first time) to tell him why she's upset and doesn't want to go to his place. There's no one strong reason. She's jealous of his girlfriend whom he just moved in with, she says she's bored there, that her dad doesn't understand her and that she feels like her soul is sucked out of her when she's there. I tried to be as gentle and diplomatic as I could in explaining to him what's going on with her (and it's not new news). I get that it's hard to hear. And that is frustrating. But...

His response? ""I wish you'd just get a damn boyfriend.""

It hurt. I've been single for almost 7 years. I've dated, had my heart broken, given up a million times, and eventually come to the conclusion that I'm much MUCH happier by myself. But it's hard sometimes. I'm not living in my home country and cultural and language issues factor in. I get lonely. But I've made my life here work and I'm proud of everything I've achieved. 

I've always put everything I have into being the best mom for my daughter when she's with me. Dating, whatever it looks like at whatever time, has been something for the weeks when she's with her dad. I love her so much and I love our time together. And he wants me to take that from her and turn my attention to some dude so she doesn't have it quite so good at my place??

I don't know. The whole thing just has me feeling so shitty and I just needed to get it off my chest somewhere.

To preempt some questions: yes, she's seeing a therapist and yes, I'm sure she's safe over there.

EDIT: Wow, I just woke up to hundreds of messages and comments and I can't express how heartwarming and encouraging it all is for me. Thank you all so much for your kind words and support (and for the laughs I got from some of the less kind comments about my ex). I can't keep up with the replies but I'm reading as much as I can. I want to reassure everyone that I'm keeping a very close eye on things and will work with my daughter's therapist to find a solution that will work for her.

Thank you to everyone who shared stories about amazing single moms. I'm sure they're very proud of the people you've become. And to all the single parents: Stay strong and try not to blame yourself for picking the wrong partner. We're all human and we do silly things for love.

"What is this unfounded obsession that some dudes seem to have with women being after their money, free dinners, etc?","So I'm fortunate to have a rad partner who is not like this in the least. We are both solid earners and provide for each other equally, and I don't feel that all guys think the way that I am describing below. 

But I have to laugh when I see the sheer amount of dudes constantly fretting online about all the women they think are after their money and trying to use them for free dates and meals. Ironically, it's almost always a dude who is a really average earner flipping out about imaginary girls who want free dinners, gifts, etc. 

This shit is borderline comedic to me because while I know that there are definitely individuals out there who will take advantage and have ulterior motives, it is nowhere near as common as Dudes Online™ will have you think. I literally just saw a thread of guys musing amongst themselves about how to tell whether a woman likes them or their giant piles of cash and success. I'm like...none of you have this problem. Respectfully.

I feel like a lot of it is an extension of a very subtle form of misogyny and distrust of women that really isn't that valid. Does this make sense? This is bizarre to me.

EDIT:

This post went nuts while I was asleep! I've enjoyed reading all of your thoughts (the ones I can get to at least). It's good to know that I'm not imagining this. 

People who have mentioned the depiction of gold digging behavior in the media are definitely onto something for sure. This is super pervasive in US media. I've also seen a fair amount of people mention that their male teenagers have started to replicate this behavior. This and the media portrayals probably go hand in hand, and then I'm sure that the digital age complicates this even further.

I'd also like to mention another angle here that I didn't previously: women, especially those who are themselves stable earners, will definitely look for men to tick very basic boxes like being employed and having their own vehicle. This is very natural, and both genders do this almost subconsciously. In fact, you should do this, since many relationship conflicts are borne out of financial issues, and this can be a way of kind of vetting for those things. I don't think that this is what I'm referring to. 

Finally, yes, there are definitely a small number of women who will date for free drinks and dinner. That is obviously goofy behavior and not cool. What I am talking about above is a distinct phenomenon among large swathes of men who try to pin their relationship issues or some kind of deep rooted insecurity on ""gold digging"" behavior that they're simply not experiencing. The dude from my high school who works part time at the gas station and can't find a girlfriend because he is insufferable does not need to be on Facebook like ""women want you for your money and that's FACTS! 💯😔"". This same behavior takes a lot of forms across a wide group of dudes who kind of go down the same path. It is a form of misogyny, plain and simple.",1645352262.0,trivialbullshit,TwoXChromosomes
Tonight is why Trump's America scares me,"If this isn't allowed, let me know and I'll delete it.
My fiance and I are currently on a socially distanced vacation of hiking and camping. Since we are only at this campsite for one night and we were getting in late, instead of cooking we ran to a burger joint in a small town nearby. It was more crowded inside than we were comfortable with (and where we are has no mask mandate) so we donned our masks and went in to place a carry out order. The hostess was extremely rude to us, including pushing my partner out of the way. She took our order and we both added an upgrade version. I didn't notice but she didn't look him in the eye when he ordered. We went to a (much less busy) place next door to drink a beer on the patio while we waited. The bartender mentioned we could just eat there so we decided to. When it was time to pick up our food I went to grab it and the hostess was just as rude to me in tone and mannerisms. 

When I got back with our food I mentioned how rude she was to me for wearing a mask. Fiance then realizes that his burger didn't have the upgrade even though it says so on the ticket but mine did. I ask if he wants me to go say something. He says no, because he's brown, and what I percieved as rude, he realized was racism. 

As a white woman, I've been told my whole life to stand up for myself, that I'm equal and to demand it. And he's been told, you're brown, pick your battles. And it pisses me off that tonight he was right. That with everything that has happened recently, me complaining about a burger in a conservative area of the country, could escalate and isn't worth it. That the hostess wasn't rude to me because of a mask, but because I'm in an interracial relationship. That while it goes against my instinct to not say something, when he mentioned Breonna Taylor and George Floyd,  I knew he was right, that a $3 upcharge could escalate based on how that hostess acted. And I fucking hate it. I hate that in this version of America, the racist assholes have the upper hand.

This fucking terrifies me at the same time.  

 The only part of this I find at all humorous is that we can be talking about a hostess being racist to him and I'm sitting there dumbly thinking she was being rude to me because of the mask until he points out that it's because I'm in an interracial relationship, and how deep we were in that conversation when I realized it🤦‍♀️

Edit:  1) to all of those asking how we know she wasn't just rude all the time or having a bad day, it's because she was nice to everyone but us. Nice to the guy in front ordering take out, nice to the guy behind me asking for a table. 

2) everyone giving awards, thank you but please donate to an organization that can do some good in this world instead of wasting your money here.",1600834871.0,sofo07,TwoXChromosomes
"My fiancé chose me, and I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this before.","So yesterday, I (34f), came down with a rather nasty chest infection/sinusitis. (negative RATs but waiting PCR results). Anyways. This threw a spanner in the works for a bunch of plans I’d been looking forward to for weeks, one of which was going to see his family and spend the weekend there. I love his family very much and already feel like I’m a part of theirs even though we’re not married yet (together nearly 4 years). 

I knew he was upset because we haven’t visited in a while and I thought he’d be upset with me, so I told him he should go by himself.  I overheard him on the phone to his mum saying he was sorry we couldn’t make it but I was rather sick and he needed to look after me. 

I bought it up later with him and said I was sorry he missed seeing his family (especially a dinner with his cousin and partner who have been overseas for ages) and he kind of surprisingly said “what? No.. I need to look after you. You look after me when I’m sick.. this is what we do now”. I was very taken aback. I’ve been in quite a few long term relationships (previously engaged in fact)  and have NEVER had a partner prioritise me like this. 

This may be a normal thing, I don’t even know. I am dealing with my past trauma a lot and have come so far with the love of this man. I just can’t believe how lucky I am to have him.

*UPDATE*: After your words of support I have contacted some anti violence centers and am going through the process of finding a lawyer to bring this matter to the police. 
If I have any other news, I will share if possible. 


This happened yesterday and I’m still processing what happened. 
I’ll keep this short, excuse any formatting errors since I’m on mobile. 

I (26F) finally was able to get a new family doctor after having moved to a new city. It had been a long time since I had a visit and was desperate to get some help for various problems that had been making life difficult.

At the beginning the doctor was more than helpful, his expertise and knowledge made me feel relaxed and, maybe this was my first mistake. 

As I got more comfortable, so did he, as he started making more and more sexual remarks, saying how i seemed so passionate, even going so far as to tell me 
“I’m sure you like to command in most situations”, … Then it all went downhill.

He told me to take off my shirt since he wanted to inspect my chest. (I had assumed this made sense due to some hormonal issues I had, but looking back on this, I’m not so sure). 
He proceeded to make me more uncomfortable commenting on how “if i’m anxious without a shirt, next time he’ll take off my underwear”

He proceeded to, and god if this is hard to write, pinch my nipples (to see if there was any secretion? but alas I am not pregnant), and even if this was true, he did this for an odd amount of time. He repeated the fact that I liked to command from earlier, adding this time 
“I’m in command now”, pausing for me to confirm this statement, all whilst I was shirtless.

The story does not stop here, after having seen my tattoos he was adamant in showing me his own. He took off his shirt and made me touch his biceps, insisting on talking about his tattoos.


As I was dressing, he told me “This situation made you wet didn’t it?” As I didn’t respond he kept on looking at me laughing to confirm it as I pathetically tried to clothe myself.

In the end he looks at me with his arms wide open 
“I’ll give you this medicine for free now if you give me a kiss,”

I look at him confused and he comes towards me, trying to hug me and I have to physically push him off telling him I have a partner so he just replies that next time I’ll feel more relaxed and it’ll be our little secret.


I’ve left out some details, mainly because admitting this to myself is already hard enough, posting it online to public scrutiny is more than I usually am used to.

However, I need to tell someone, because I cannot stand this mental image any longer.

If you’re still reading this, and wondering why I didn’t run away, let me tell you … I was so fearful and confused I didn’t know what else to do… Some may understand but, never have I hated myself more for not reacting… I wish I would have at least yelled, done something. I am sorry. After this whole ordeal I feel dirty, used, pathetic.

The only thing I can assume as to why I didn’t react earlier is kind of like a frog in slow boiling water. I guess I was too naive….

"Once you see the reality of motherhood, it's hard to unsee it.","I am a 28-year-old woman living in the United States. I'm at that age where people are asking me why I don't have any kids yet or why I am waiting as long as I am to have children. I plan on waiting even longer, and I am technically a fence sitter. Why? Because I see the reality of what motherhood is,especially here in the United States and that deters me from wanting to ever have children of my own. Mothers here in the US are underappreciated, underpaid, and taken advantage of  practically every single step of the way. The US lacks affordable health care, daycare, and living wages. You cannot rely on the father of your child to stick around and help you with your child or children. Your career suffers. Your body suffers. Your mental health suffers. And whenever you reach out for help, people look you dead in your face and say that you asked for this, so you deal with it. There is a lack of community for mothers and it seems that people only want you to have children so you can join them in misery. 

I read the regretful parents subreddit nearly every day, which maybe I shouldn't do, but it seems to be the only place on the internet where people are honest about their parenthood experience. Most of the time people lie about their parenthood experience and try to make it sound so much better than what it actually is and motherhood is romanticized so much in society that it's no wonder that the reality of what it actually is, is so shocking to people when they find themselves in it. 

I have quite a few friends around my age with children and they are absolutely miserable with minimal support from their families. Money is always tight, and their partners are nearly always unhelpful. It's sad to watch. 

My partner wants to have children someday but unfortunately they're only seeing the romanticized side of things. I myself have seen the effects and damages of motherhood on many an individual, and it is making me hesitant to ever pursue motherhood. It is hard for me to see any positives about motherhood. This does make me sad because I don't think motherhood should be as difficult as it is and that there should be more support for mothers here in the US and globally, but unfortunately we just don't have that. And because of that, how could I ever fully convince myself that having a child is a good idea, knowing that it may very well be my downfall? 

Does anyone else here feel similar?

If you read this far, thank you.

"Tried looking up advice on my relationship problems from the perspective of my boyfriend to see what advice he's getting, instantly regretted it.","This is a bit of an older story, but I just want to share.

So for information, me and my (now ex) boyfriend were having problems because we have very different sex drives. He wanted to have sex AT LEAST once a day, and I really could only manage once every few days. He started to get really frustrated about it. We talked about it of course and it was obvious that it was not something I could compromise on safely and consensually.

Anyways, I started looking up (for myself) what to do. Most sources (for women) online told me that this is normal, and that sometimes people just aren't sexually compatible. The authors suggested finding new ways to excite myself or considering terminating the relationship.

I figured my boyfriend must have been looking to the internet for advice/support as well, so I tried looking it up from his perspective. The top articles that came up were pretty disgusting. Almost all of them encouraged him to cheat on me, most of them said something to the effect of ""if she were really attracted to you, she'd put out"", most also told him I might be gay (GAY? Just because I can't have sex everyday?), most of them suggested he attempt to make me feel jealous by flirting with other women or EVEN MY FRIENDS, A lot of them also suggested he threaten to leave me. To be fair, these were just the top articles to pop up.

I talked to him about what I read one night and he admitted that he had seen some of those articles too. I explained to him how all of that is TERRIBLE and CRUEL advice and he completely agreed. We had a laugh about it. We broke up for different reasons. It's just sad.

The rough around the edges types end up being down right abusive. The “sensitive” ones will do whatever they can to bring you down and elevate themselves.
Literally NONE of them are bothering to do any work on themselves, and in my experience have expected me to act as their mother/therapist/fleshlight. 
They put me in a box that I don’t fit in, and then expect me to square their circles. When I don’t or can’t do that, I’m made to feel so small.
I’ve been in therapy trying to work through my issues within myself so that I will not only be a more healed person, but a good partner to whoever I end up with in the end, and at this rate I’ve realized my healing process will likely inevitably only be for myself in the end.
Most of what I’m working through and trying to recover from is experiences of abuse from the men in my life.
What’s the point of slapping proverbial bandaid on the wounds if I keep returning to the source? 
I’m done. 
15+ years of dating and 99% of the men I’ve been with couldn’t even make me cum. If I had a nickel for every orgasm I’ve faked I could probably put a down payment on a house at this rate. I hate that I’ve been conditioned to put the needs of these heartless men before my own. I hate that I’ve shelved my accomplishments, my goals, my experiences and my personal life aside for the comfort of my male partners. All because I’m so anxious of losing them.
I hate that I’m like this, it makes me feel so pathetic at times, especially because I’m generally an outgoing, independent problem solver. I have so much love for my community and my friends and it’s unfortunate that I can’t share that with a romantic partner, but at this rate it’s doing more harm than good.

I’m grateful this community is here. Thanks for letting me rant.",1711297267.0,midday--moon,TwoXChromosomes
"Straight women, do you date bi men? ","Hey everyone, I started a new job a few months ago in an office that is mostly women and it's been mostly wonderful so far. Before this I spent 8 years in a very male dominated industry where I was usually the only woman in a space. The new work environment has been a breath of fresh air and for the most part I've been getting along great with my colleagues. A week ago a large group of us went out for a drink after work and I'm struggling with a conversation that came up and I wanted to ask ya'll for your opinions.

I'm a bi woman who is in a long term relationship with a man. I've introduced my partner to some of my colleagues at a social gathering and I haven't mentioned that I'm bi, so I'm guessing they're all assuming I'm straight. Now at drinks, the topic of dating comes up and one of my colleagues tells us about this man she met who was wonderful and ticked all her boxes but on the third date he mentioned that he's bi and she doesn't want to see him anymore because to her that's a deal breaker. At this point almost all of the women there (maybe 10 out of the 15 folks there, all straight and in their 30s) chime in in agreement that they wouldn't date a bi guy either. I'm really confused but don't say anything but when I got home afterwards I couldn't sleep and it kept eating away at me. 

So the next day I text a couple of my good straight woman friends and I ask them if it matters to them if a guy they're seeing is bi. To my surprise one of them said that it would. When I asked why, she got a bit defensive and said that she's allowed to have preferences. Again, I'm confused but leave it at that. 

What I don't understand is why? If you have a preference that the person you date is straight, how is that not being homophobic? Like as long as this person is attracted to you how does their larger sexuality effect you in any way? The thing is these are all people who I would think of as progressive and liberal and allies based on their other views. So I'm very confused and have been feeling weirdly uncomfortable at work ever since. 

I wanted to ask the straight women here, is this a thing? Do ya'll not date bi men? And if so, why on earth not?

I should get myself a wife,"In my new job, I almost exclusively work with men. I directly work for men only a couple of years away from retirement. They are all great and treat me like a full member of the team (despite me being inexperienced yet). Some of them are quite workaholics. I still struggle a bit with work-life balance, the job is new and exciting.

Yesterday someone brought cake. after people mentioned that it was really good, he said, that all the compliments should go to his wife, she baked it. 

When I left work quite late, coming home to my empty apartment I was standing before a big pile of laundry and I was hungry. 

I realized that those workaholic coworkers all had lovely wives at home, doing all those things for them. Baking cake, doing laundry, cleaning, cooking...

The thought that came into my head was: I should get myself a wife.

Joke aside, it made me realize that this workaholic lifestyle of those men was only feasible because they have someone that does that work for free. Work, that if I hired someone would be really expensive and probably would still not be as good as ""a wife"".

I absolutely hate having sex with my partner,"Update: i talked to him about some of the things that were bothering me. He didn’t realize how bad it had gotten on my end, and brought up some good points from his perspective. It was a productive conversation and a good start. 

—————————————————-

I apologize if this is the wrong forum for this post. 

I dread sex with him. I genuinely dread it and do everything I can to avoid sex acts. When we first got together years ago our sex life was exuberant and he was enthusiastic about my pleasure. Over the years it has devolved to me giving him oral sex out of obligation, and then he falls immediately asleep. And then I cry alone in the bathroom because I feel absolutely awful after. My libido has been at zero for a long time. 

During sexual activity I do all the work 80% of the time. I give him one sided oral. If we have PIV sex I’m on top doing all the work, and it takes ages. And then I have to finish him off orally/manually which takes even longer. It is exhausting and stops being pleasurable for me after 5 minutes. So now I have 20+ minutes left where I have to physically work to bring him to orgasm. 

I can count on one hand the number of times he has made me orgasm in the last few years. I admit it’s hard to turn me on these days but he does not try at all anymore. Ever. I don’t even get affection from him. 

There’s a lot of issues here that just feel impossible to solve and it all seems to come down to me. It feels so one sided and I just don’t even have the energy to talk about it with him.

Edit: this post blew up more than expected. Thank you all for your feedback and for hearing me vent.

Edit again: Dang, that’s a lot of comments. I apologize for not including more context in my post. It’s not fair to my partner that I’m only showing one side of a very complicated situation. 

I just planned to vent and see if anyone else struggled with similar feelings haha. I plan on having a serious conversation with him this week, thank you all again for your comments!",1676475281.0,incerta,TwoXChromosomes
"My (30F) husband (31M) just took his buddies to our couple’s getaway when I refused to come, because he called me ungrateful for pointing out how unfair the expectation of “mental load” is on women","
My husband (31M) and I (30F) have been married for 2 years. At first, me carrying the “mental load” was a problem he literally couldn’t see. 

For context, those who are unfamiliar with the term mental load or ""worry work,"" involves overseeing tasks rather than doing them. It means managing a constant to-do list, delegating tasks to family members, and ensuring they get done. Basically emotional labour done by women that husbands don’t see because they are always in the “let me know if you need my help” mode. 

I was tired of constantly having to be the project manager of the house, and even if I freed myself of it, the household would fall apart.


It was not a walk in the park to try to get through to him. But after many, many conversations, including facilitation with a couple’s councillor to really get the message across. 

This was a struggle for a while, and right now we are at a place where things are good, relatively speaking of course. We both share the mental load now, but if it weren’t for MY intervention, we wouldn’t have been able to reach a place where I felt like we are equals. However I do recognise that some women aren’t even able to verbalise it and it’s disappointing that women have to fix these issues and the underlying expectation that wives are supposed deal with the daily drudgery while men go out and explore the world. 

Sorry about the rant. Anyway, a week ago, my younger cousin sister, who recently moved in with her boyfriend said something to me that suggested she was facing the same problems that I did, but didn’t know the correct term “mental load” for it. Anyway, I shared my perspective and knowledge with her and hopefully she’ll be able to talk to her boyfriend soon about it.


Just two nights ago, I was talking to my husband during dinner and said I find it extremely frustrating and ironic that even here, women have to take on the mental load of initiating and navigating the conversation about “mental load” and that itself isn’t easy. It wasn’t an attack on him, and I frankly thought he would be able to empathise since we’ve been in therapy before. I just said I feel tired even thinking about what my cousin would have to plan, organise and say to convey her thoughts. 


My husband got really irate instantly and said I was being an ungrateful person for feeling like talking about mental load is itself a mental load. Then said that if women fair better at some things, men fair better in quietly working hard without announcing all that they do. 

I said that this was completely uncalled for, and that by relating my struggles about mental load with my cousin, I wasn’t doing anything wrong. Eventually this caused an argument. 


Now, I do see and recognise that he might have not been the right person to talk to, about this. Maybe if I shared my issues with my mom or sister, it would’ve made more sense. But I genuinely thought that my husband is my partner and I shouldn’t have to worry about my words taken in bad faith. 

I was really upset about our argument and being called ungrateful so I told him I am not interested in going on our weekend getaway we had planned some time ago. This wasn’t to punish him by withdrawing intimacy, I genuinely didn’t think I wanted to be near my husband after what he assumed about me. 

He said I was being manipulative and took his buddies to the bnb we booked and had fun there. Here I am feeling upset about how indifferent my husband seems.

I honestly feel so abandoned that my husband didn’t even bother to check up on me. I’ve texted him so many times and called him maybe a hundred times, but it seems that he doesn’t care. ",1719964530.0,Throwramentalload1,TwoXChromosomes
Flirty dude who already has a partner.,"It’s an ugly tale. Felt sparks w a dude and just a super solid connection: the funny, the smart, sexy, listened to me when I spoke, all good markers. We’ve been mostly texting, waiting for a time he isn’t so busy w work. No biggie, I’m busy too. So he pops up on Facebook because now all you have to do is be standing near someone and Facebook suggests you add them! Sure enough I see he has a partner. Of course he didn’t know how to tell me. Of course she overcame cancer last year and hasn’t gotten her libido back. Of course she doesn’t want an open relationship but he wants me to go for it anyways. 
Just heartbreaking for me, knowing what I know, all the countless women this happens too. Abandoned because beyond their control they can no longer give their person sexual gratification. I’m the newer model he’s willing to go for, as his partner struggles to come to terms with a major life change. Im sure it is frustrating to still have a sex drive when your partner has done, but I’m not a fucking blow up doll.

Men hate it when women have high standards and don’t tolerate bs,"I’ve been seeing this a lot recently where men get upset whenever a women has high standards for her future SO. Women aren’t obligated to lower their standards. It’s also hilarious whenever they say “Good luck being this picky in your 30s” or “No one will want you after you turn 30s”. They love to say that like they have women in their twenties lining up to date them. It seems like it’s gotten more prevalent recently due to the rise of online dating and women setting high standards.

"Is it just me, or do you hate it when sex lasts a long time?","Growing up, TV and movies often referred to ""one minute men"" . Personally, I've never encountered a one minute man. However, I have been with a few ""one hour"" men. Let me tell you, it's awful. After enough time, I'm just wondering if he's not finishing earlier because I'm not attractive enough? After a bit, it starts to hurt, starts to feel like a chore. When it lasts too long, I'm sore and wrecked for a week in a way that is anything but sexy. 

Years ago, I asked one of my especially promiscuous gay friends about this, he said ""just look him in the eyes all sexy, and say, I want you to come"".
 I've tried this with a handful of men and it hasn't really worked. I brought this up with a promiscuous female friend of mine and she told me she starts to literally do a countdown to them, all dominant sexy like, ""I will count to ten and I want you to come.... 10.... 9.... 8....""
But, I wouldn't dare try that one! Not my style.

Some men, I've mentioned at times outside of sex how it would make me feel hot and desired if they came sooner. One guy I was with told me he always ""wants to come instantly"" but he goes into his head to stop this. I encouraged him that it would be better if he wasn't in his head and if he came quick that would be alright. After a lot of coaching, turned out his version of ""quick"" was maybe, maybe, ten minutes, which, to me, is perfect!

 I think a lot of men aren't actively within the moment with a new sexual partner. I think they have a lot of performance anxieties around lasting a long time. So, in the meanwhile, here we are sweaty body-to-body but he's in his head thinking about sports or whatever to make sure he doesn't come quick. That's awful. We are supposed to be having a shared experience here.

There are rare instances where I want it to last a long time. Those times are great. Us in it together. That's a version of sex that is great in the right time and place. However, most of the time, I feel like maybe ten minutes, fifteen is good. After that is when it can start to feel bad. Most of the time my internal organs can't handle a marathon. My stamina can't handle that either. 

A ""one minute man"" would be an honour, tbh. Would make me feel like I'm sexy as fuck. If intercourse makes him last only one minute, well, that's what foreplay is for. I think men have all the wrong ideas of what women like. 

But, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe not as many women have this issue as I do. 

What is your ideal length of time for penetrative sex?",1710280417.0,HempBlonde,TwoXChromosomes
My husband pled guilty after raping me,"Back Story:

We were separated, he'd been sexually assaulting me for years and I had finally filed gotten the courage to file for divorce. He kept making excuses for why he could not hold up his end of our custody agreement. I'd just started a new job and did not have daycare lined up yet. The agreement was for him to stay for 4 days to watch over the kids while I worked for that first week.

I hadn't been assaulted by him in a while, he seemed to have excepted the divorce, he had a new partner from what I understood, and I thought I was safe again.

The assault:

On 09/12/2019 (the last of the 4 days he was staying, I was taking him home in the morning) I went to sleep after coming home from work (evening shift nursing so around midnight). I woke up twice in the middle of the night because I could feel what he was doing. I turned my head to look at him and he immediately stopped. He had been masturbating and penetrating me with his fingers. I was still too weak to move my body and dozed off again. The second time I woke up he had immediately started again. This time I was awake enough to move my body. I. Kicked. The. FUCK. Out of him. I kicked him hard enough that he fell from the bed and hit the floor. But while I was kicking him, I felt myself hitting a smaller body. He had our 3 year old (unpotty-trained) son laying naked next to him while he did this.

I don't remember if I slept again. I know that in the morning I sent him a message to confront him. I knew if I went downstairs to confront him face to face, I would kill him. He apologized and said he never meant to hurt me and he just didn't want a divorce. He always said this after he assaulted me. It was like he had a script in his mind of what to say to make me let it go. I got up. I put on something, I don't remember what I wore this morning. I marched downstairs, past him, grabbed my keys, went to the police station and told on him.

Reporting:

The first officer to greet me listened to my story and said ""Okay.......he's your HUSBAND."" As if that should have excused it. I don't know what it was about the way that I looked at him but he immediately went and got the detective they had who specialized in sex crimes. HE listened to me and took the report seriously. They let me write it out in detail. He asked me what I wanted to happen. He told me what the next steps were. I asked that they made him go to therapy. I knew that he likely did these things to me because he was violated the same way throughout his childhood. I knew he was a first time offender and jail was not likely so I wanted to make sure he was rehabilitated in SOME way.

He found the police report paper as soon as I got back (I'm sure someone who knew him saw the car parked at the police station after I went and told him). He ran from the officers for 10 days and then went in to talk to them and tell them that he did it because ""it was his kink"". They'd already filed charges and put out a warrant the day before, so they booked him 09/23/2019. He stayed there until March of 2020 when he was released on house arrest. This was when quarantine began.

The courts were closed until 2022 and then they continued. Lots of stalling over these years from his lawyer. Even a no call no show from his lawyer. They offered him a couple f reasonable plea deals. He came back with one for misdemeanor assault. We said no. I did not want it to look like this was not a sex crime. That was really important to me. No deal was reached. They marched on to trial. It was set for earlier this year. In the weeks leading up to trial, things were looking shaky. I was advised that cases like mine were extra hard because many people this men should be able to brutalize their wives. But I stuck it out. If I didn't fight for me, I knew I could not live with myself. No matter the result. About 4 days before the first day of trial, the prosecuting attorney and victim advocate (amazing women who were my only support through this process. I hope life is extra sweet to them for the rest of their days) called to tell me he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor domestic assault and 2 years of probation on the sex offender case load. A PO who works with sex offenders and sex offender therapy. No hand guns. And although it was not a rape conviction, it was him admitting to harming me on purpose, which felt great.

&#x200B;

I wanted to share this because, in the months leading up to trial, I **SCOURED** this reddit. Looking for someone with a story like mine. Looking at stories from women who had won their case. Looking at stories from women whose abusers got away with it. I wanted to be prepared for it all. So, I hope that any other woman going through this can find this story as well. If a woman like me is reading this, I just want you to know that it is not okay for a person to violate you, **no matter what** their role in your life is. It was hard, but every moment of freedom after stepping into that police station was worth it. Every night that I got to sleep and not wake up to him touching me. Learning how to stay inside of my body again. Learning how to say ""NO"" and set boundaries without fear. Seeing myself start to smile and laugh again. Finding my personality again. Seeing our kids change now that they do not have to witness abuse anymore.

There is SO much good life to live outside of abuse.

&#x200B;

\[Editing to add more information\]

I did not expect so many people to see this. Thank you all for your kind words and support. After I reported him I ended up moving to where he could not find us. I was facing heavy harassment from his family and it was the victim advocate and detective who suggested moving for safety.

No contact with him since 2019. Our kids have been doing great. A lot of you asked how the son who was assaulted is doing. He is neurodivergent so it is hard to really discuss this with him. However, he has become a very happy and creative kiddo. Always laughing and singing and dancing. He is very protective of other people and hates to see others be hurt or picked on. My daughter who is the eldest is old enough to communicate for herself and I have asked her if her dad ever did anything inappropriate to her. She says no but she has also asked not to see him outside of occasional visits and even then she asked for no in person contact at all.

Vanilla Sex Should Be The Standard For Casual Hook Ups Until Boundaries Are Set.,"I know, I know, this may not go down well but hear me out. 
I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been told or read here about some weird, aggressive and predatory actions happening during a hook up. 

Just this morning I read about the poor lady who had something happen anally. That is definitely not a causal, “man I bet she would love this!” type of move. I can confidently say that the sexual experiences between people are extremely different, but the idea that consent is a must before proceeding with any of your kinks or desires should be remembered and respected. 

With that said, casual hook ups, especially first time hook ups, should be pretty vanilla unless boundaries are set or permission is asked. Consent, consent, consent. You don’t know who is and isn’t into oral sex, spanking, candle wax, etc. (whatever your kink is.) 

Of course permission applies to couples as well, but I would hope that couples would realize and respect the boundaries of their partners. 

So my advice to everyone is to play it safe with first time and casual hook ups and keep it pretty vanilla until boundaries and kinks have been talked about. Better to play it safe than give your partner a horrible experience.



Edit: Wasn’t expecting this to blow up but I’m happy to see lots of discussion happening below. Thank you for keeping it pretty productive and respectful everyone. 
With that being said, I guess everyone has a different definition of vanilla but the main thing that we can all agree on is the importance of consent and discussion. Most fucking definitely. The best sex is when both partners are comfortable, enjoying and respected. 

When I wrote this, I had casual encounters in mind; tinder hook up, night out, etc. Times when discussion may be skipped due to the heat of the moment. I wrote it as a reminder then even when the heat of the moment takes over and the boundary discussion hasn’t happen, play it safe. Don’t go choking people (anything that kill someone is a no-go on a whim right?), surprise anal, finishing on someone’s face, etc. 

Everyone is different so please respect that. Consent all the way. As I said below as an example, I sure as hell wouldn’t get turned off if someone asked me if they could go down on me in the moment and visa verse, I’ve been told it’s hot when I take it slow and ask permission before moving forward. 

Respect, consent, boundaries. These are key.

"He didn't want to wear a condom. Tried (and failed) to gaslight me with the argument that, ""Safety is an illusion""","So I meet this guy out in world.  He asks me out on a date, I accept.  We get along swimmingly.   We've been dating for about 3 weeks and it's getting on time for sex... it feels natural and right.  We are both a bit older past that time in life where we jump in bed right away so this is a planned activity.  He's going to spend the night for the first time.  For me, this is a big step with someone.

 Now I'm going to tell you that part of this is completely MY fault because we didn't discuss protection beforehand.. but my gosh it's 2019, aren't condoms a given nowadays?  We did discuss STD's and we both said we didn't have any and the last time we'd been tested. 

Anyhoo.. things are going hot and heavy and like the girl scout I am, I reach into the nightstand and pull out a condom.

He said, ""WTF is that for?"" 

::RECORD SCRATCH:: 

I knew *immediately* that this was going to be an issue and that I'd made a mistake.   He wanted to discuss it in bed, but I insisted we gather our clothing back on and head out to the living room for a discussion.

His attitude was snarky, condescending and his words were designed to make ME feel bad about insisting on condoms.   He couldn't *believe* that I didn't trust him.  How could I have sex with him if I didn't trust him 100%?  (HA!)   

Honestly, if I had ANY small amount of trust for someone I met 3 weeks ago it'd certainly gone out the window with this display.  Who the hells knows what you have or your recent partners might because you are obviously into high risk sex.   

His next tactic is trying to convince me that ""Safety is an illusion"" that I was being stupid, illogical, and an overly-cautious, silly female. 

I said, ""Has that actually worked for you before? Because that's the most bullshit thing I ever heard.  Life is full of risks, so nothing is ever 100% safe but it's perfectly reasonable and logical to at least take precautions.   Do you wear a seatbelt in the car? Safety glasses if you are using a saw? A helmet for riding a bike?  Those activities can kill you but you still use reasonable precautions, right?   The very fact that you are trying to make me feel crazy and wrong for wanting you to wear a condom lets me know we are never going to be compatible and you can fuck right off. Seriously. "" 

I walked over to the front door, opened it and said, ""Please leave.  Now."" 

He asked if this meant I was breaking it off with him.  Hell yes, I am.  He said he ""couldn't believe it that I would break it off over something so trivial"" and was refusing to leave. 

The chutzpah of this guy just pissed me off.   Yeah, my health, so fucking trivial dude.  

I grabbed his overnight bag and the shirt he'd brought on a hanger and threw them out into the hallway. ""I'm not wasting another breathe on you, asshole.  Get out NOW or I'm calling the cops.""

He did finally leave and I immediately locked the door, blocked his phone number and  email address and haven't spoken to him since.  

Good riddance to bad rubbish.

The crazy thing is that his responses and arguments were something that he's practiced before.  He was too slick and too prepared.    He's done this before, maybe a bunch of times before.  

Ladies - don't fall for ANY of that shit and let them make you feel bad or crazy or unreasonable for sticking up for yourself.    The slightest push back or excuse on this issue is a giant red flag.  Your body and your health are worth it.

The story about labiaplasty you haven’t heard,"She was just 17 when he agreed to perform a labiaplasty on her. Like many naive young women, she thought her labia minora were not supposed to stick out.

She had read online, on surgeons’ websites and in peer-reviewed medical literature, that protruding labia minora were considered “unfeminine” and “embarrassing.” She read they were caused by excess male hormones (untrue) and excess masturbation (preposterous).

He had been recommended by the head of the OB/GYN department as the best OB/GYN surgeon at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. She was confident she was in good hands. They waited until after she turned 18 to do the procedure.

He completely removed her labia minora, performed a clitoral hood reduction without her consent, and cut the dorsal nerves of her clitoris. The glans of her clitoris would never be sexually sensitive again. Cunnilingus would never again be pleasurable.

He had only done a labiaplasty twice before. Like most OB/GYNs who do these procedures, he had not been trained to do them. He never disclosed that anything had gone wrong, but he stopped doing these surgeries after that.

She knew she had lost sensation but didn’t understand what that meant. She assumed everything would work out when she started having sex. She thought it was her fault. She didn’t know enough about her anatomy to understand he had done a separate surgery without her consent. She started seeing a new doctor because she was so uncomfortable. The new doctor was his partner. Upon seeing an 18 year old with completely amputated labia minora, she said nothing.

Later, the young woman worked up the courage to ask her doctor if her surgery had caused her difficulty with orgasm. She could not feel anything without a vibrator, she said. Despite the visible scars reaching well into her clitoral hood, her female doctor told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function.

The original male doctor meanwhile became president of the Texas Medical Association.

The young woman finally found her clitoris. The glans was not sensitive like it was supposed to be. She went to a new female doctor. The new doctor also told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function. She suggested she fall in love. Though the new doctor was “horrified” that all her labia minora had been amputated, she did not tell her she could report it.

The young woman started doing research. Eventually she figured out a clitoral hood reduction had been performed without her consent. Given the course of the dorsal nerves along the clitoral body, she figured out they must have been injured.

The young woman did a lot of research. She realized the course of the dorsal nerves was never mentioned in literature on clitoral hood reductions. It was never shown in OB/GYN journals. It was never shown in OB/GYN textbooks. She also learned that the sexual function of the labia minora was rarely described. She thought her doctor must not have realized they were important. How else could he have completely amputated them? She thought he must not have realized the dorsal nerves were at risk. She decided this error must have occurred because her doctor didn’t know the anatomy.

She wrote him a letter telling him what he had done and asking him to help her change training standards to protect other patients.

He responded reminding her that the surgery was her choice. He reminded her that she had requested her labia minora not stick out. He had only tried to give her what she asked for.

He told her he stayed far away from her clitoral hood and frenulum. But there were scars to prove otherwise.

The young woman became emotionally unstable after reading this letter. She wanted to report him but was told the board would likely blame her and take his side. She had never had what happened to her confirmed by a doctor, so she went to see one. It was confirmed. This was what she had needed to give legitimacy to her complaint, she thought.

But it became unbearable. No one around her seemed to understand the magnitude of what had happened. People asked her what the big deal was. People asked her why she needed justice. When she tried to talk to therapists, they asked about her feelings about her mother. It had taken 7 years to finally get it confirmed. She had hoped it was fixable somehow. It wasn’t fixable.

She felt ashamed. How could she have been so stupid to not file a lawsuit when there was still time? She read research on resilience. Based on all the parameters surrounding her trauma, she did not think she could ever be okay. It was like getting horribly raped in a world where rape isn’t considered a crime. She read she needed acknowledgment, support, etc. Most of all, she needed to change the problem of pervasive systemic negligence. But no one was even seeing it. She didn’t like the wreck of a person she was becoming.

One night she set Joy Division “Atmosphere” on repeat, took 60 Vicodin, some Xanax, some Benadryl hoping that would help stop her heart, and as much whiskey as she could drink. Her dad checked on her in the middle of the night. He took her to the hospital.

She was afraid to report after that. She was afraid of getting told it was her fault. She was afraid of people defending her doctor. One OB/GYN she had gone to had said:

“You should have known all surgery carried risk. You can never completely control a result.”

It had been wrong site surgery. That should never happen. But she was afraid of this. She was afraid even doctors wouldn’t understand the difference between the labia minora and the clitoral hood.

She told herself she would report him when she got more stable. Back then there was no statute of limitations. She thought she had time.

When she finally got the courage to report, they had passed a new statute of limitations. She missed it by a week.

So she started coming up with new ideas for how to stand up for herself. She wrote a letter to the head of patient safety at the hospital. He agreed to meet with her. But she was too afraid. She thought if she wrote down everything she needed to say, complete with references, this would help. She started writing.

But she hated writing. She’d never been any good at it.

She wrote what she called, “A Clinical History, Causal Analysis, and Proposed Solutions.” She wrote a background of the anatomy and prevalence of labiaplasty. She wrote a clinical history of herself. Then she broke down all the causal factors accordingly:
1. Motivation
2. Cause of surgical error
3. Failure to disclose or report

Then she wrote a proposal. Solving problems at every error point was important. She got a bit overwhelmed. There were so many problems.

She got very stuck. She kept getting dizzy. She’d get angry at herself for getting dizzy. She was being weak, she thought.

People asked when she was ever going to do anything worthwhile. They told her she was lazy. She didn’t deserve to live in such a nice apartment, they said. She didn’t deserve to wear such nice clothes, they said. She didn’t deserve vacations. She should be ashamed of herself for not having a career like everyone else. They told her she wasn’t dealing with this well. When was she ever going to learn to deal with anything? She mostly kept to herself. When she tried to date, issues would come up. Men told her they couldn’t date her because she was emotionally unstable. One said he’d rather date a barista with a plan.

The worst part isn’t what happened. The worst part is how much I came to hate myself for not handling it better. I’m working on that. 

My doctor isn’t some random “bad apple.” He is an extremely reputable OB/GYN. He has been president of the Texas Medical Association and president of the Dallas County Medical Society. 
Other doctors still talk about his “integrity” and “selflessness,” as they give him awards. He was also featured in Time Magazine for delivering the first uterus transplant baby. 

But honestly, the worst part isn’t what happened to me. The worst part has been everything that has happened since in my struggle to get acknowledgment and to address the systemic negligence that continues to put others at risk.

If I could get my doctor to acknowledge what he did, he has the political power to help change training standards to keep other patients safe. Instead, he refuses to acknowledge it. Though his colleague has explained to him that I have visible scars proving what he did, he insists he didn’t do it. He says I must have had a second surgery or that I operated on myself.

Perhaps the worst part is how medical leadership has stood by him and refused to even talk to me about changing curriculums and board exams because of who my doctor was. This happened due to systemic negligence that will not change as long as people refuse to admit there is any problem. Doctors continue to do vulvar cosmetic surgeries (and treatment of hypertrophy) without training.

Even with my dad as the head of the plastic surgery department at the same hospital where my doctor works, we cannot get through to him. The OB/GYN department refuses to speak to either me or my dad. After I asked them to teach clitoral neurovascular anatomy, they called legal to make sure they can’t get sued for not teaching it.

Update: We are publishing a cadaver dissection study of the neural anatomy of 10 clitorises, of which we took excellent photos. There is a new head of the OB/GYN department who wants the residents to learn it. I also got a form letter from ABOG, in which they claim to be working on new board exam questions.

Second update: I have gotten authors of two major OB/GYN textbooks (Te Linde, Williams) to publish detailed clitoral anatomy. I also convinced an OB/GYN to oversee a study published in AJOG. And finally, my study was published in The Aesthetic Surgery Journal. 

However, I have not been successful at changing privileging. To this day, someone as equally as unqualified my doctor can still get privileges to do labiaplasties at the surgery center where mine occurred and at many others. USPI, the biggest ambulatory care provider in the US, declined to require training in these procedures. Another problem is many of these are performed in private offices, where there is generally no oversight. 

Labiaplasty is still the fastest growing cosmetic procedure, as it has been for almost 2 decades.

If you or a friend has a similar story, please contact me. One expert I talk to believes there are thousands like me. Based on the other stories I have gotten, it is typical for women to get gaslighted in these situations and told their issues are psychological. This happens due to pervasive ignorance of vulvar anatomy and female sexual function in medicine. 

I need more women who are willing to be interviewed by a journalist. 🙏🏻

Edit: thanks everyone so much for all the upvotes and supportive comments! I don’t know if I’m allowed to share this, but my Instagram is @jessica_ann_pin. I talk about this and related issues there. This is my latest post showing how cross sections of the penis are always shown in anatomy textbooks but cross sections of the clitoris are shown in 0 anatomy textbooks: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/B6bnuKSp4Rt/?igshid=kp2hm8adb2oy

Third update: I have gotten 18 medical textbooks to agree to updates. 4 have now been published. I’ve also gotten Medscape, UpToDate, and WebMD to agree to updates.

ABOG now requires urogynecologists to learn clitoral innervation as part of their maintenance of certification. They have made it incentivized learning for gynecologists. They still refuse to make it required learning for gynecologists. 

ACOG still refuses to dictate the innervation of the clitoris be taught in all OB/GYN residency programs. Here is my petition to change this. It has 27,000 signatures so far.

I stood up in court and testified against the person who raped and abused me for years.,"(Potential trigger warning)

The relationship with this person started off great. He was attentive and charming. He managed to convince me to move to a city hundreds of miles away (where he was from). He took my passport, he opened a joint bank account for us and cancelled my individual account. He took out a loan in both our names and spent all the money on his outstanding debts. 
He started to beat me almost every day. He started raping me when I said no to sex. He strangled me until I was unconscious and had sex with me while I was passed out.
He made me feel like it was all my fault and told me I deserved it. 
I began believing him. I blamed myself and began hating myself. I began living for the far and few between moments of tenderness and love he showed me. It felt like I was playing a game I didn’t know the rules of. 

I managed to make some very supportive friends and eventually I managed to leave this relationship with the help of my friends. He began to stalk and harass me so I went to the police about everything. This was in summer 2018.

The police investigated, handed it to the crown prosecution service and they decided to charge him with 5 counts of rape and one count of assault (resulting in ABH). It took almost 3 years but this week it went to trial. 

When they played my video recorded evidence from 3 years ago people in the jury cried. I gave evidence in the court room behind screens as to not having to see my abuser. 
I stood up and was cross examined by the Defense barrister who told me to my face I was lying and that my ex partner was a kind and loving person. My cross examination took almost 2 hours and was the most humiliating and painful thing I ever had to do. 
But I did it. I stood up in court and told my truth and ultimately stood up to him. 

On Friday I got the call. The jury found my ex unanimously guilty of all charges and he has been remanded into custody with a sentencing hearing scheduled the second week of July. He is probably looking at double figures in jail. 

It has taken 3 years, but it is finally over. I feel like I can finally breathe. And maybe, hopefully, I have saved at least one woman from going through the same hell I did. 
I still can’t believe it and keep breaking down crying.
Nothing will undo the pain and humiliation he put me through but I am proud of myself for surviving until now. I felt like dying so many times over the past few years. I planned my own death. But at the end of the day I chose to continue living. And now, I can learn to move on from simply surviving on to thriving.

EDIT: I never expected this outpouring of support and kind messages.

Has anyone else experienced men who claim that they have a submission kink and only care about “worshipping their goddess” only to have them end up being some of the most selfish lovers ever? Lmao.,"Dated a guy. He waited til 6 months into the relationship to bring up these kinks and open me up to the idea. I was like mmm okay I guess, I’m used to selfish lovers for the most part so that could be nice being treated like a “goddess” lol. Boy were my expectations off! 

Like even just him giving me cunnilingus, he thinks is a submissive act but yet if I say I want it done a certain way HE MOPES about “I LIKE doing it *this* way though 😢😢😢” (like bruh what you’re eating MY pussy shouldn’t I be the one telling you what feels good?????), and if I ever want just a little more loving sex without having to degrade him he’ll immediately mope that he wants to do it his kinky way. And he just grabs at me like I’m a piece of meat he’s entitled to, even after I told him it is triggering to have my vulva area especially just grabbed at with no consent. He does rub my feet for long periods of time which is nice, but it gets old when your foot rubs ALWAYS have to be sexual and he wants to rub *himself* on your feet halfway through the foot rub. Part of me feels like I should be grateful, hey some women don’t even get foot rubs from their partner right 

I just find it odd he claims his kink is about worshipping me and giving me what I want, yet in reality it’s only ever what he wants he just wants to be able to have free reign to “worship” me however HE likes",1718282184.0,wizardessofwaterdeep,TwoXChromosomes
"I landed a dream job, but now I'm being let go because a guy I rejected is falsely accusing me of being inappropriate.","Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons. This has been a devastating past few days, and I’m trying to figure out how to move forward. I have proof of all of this and am prepared to present it.

I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. This role was promised to go on for several years, though I’m only away for a few days each month. I met Paul (not his real name obv) (28m) the first weekend I was on the job, and he seemed super nice. For context, I have a partner whom I've been with for nearly five years, and despite his job making us long distance for the first half of this year, our relationship is strong.

On my second trip, during a day off, I began chatting with Paul, and we hit it off. He seemed emotional, sweet, and didn’t make me feel weird in the slightest. I brought up my partner right away, and we talked about his recent breakup. I mentioned that things were difficult with my partner being away, but that they would be fine. Nothing felt out of line until the end of the night, when Paul asked if I would go back to where he was staying with him. I said no, but he persisted 3 or 4 more times, and I firmly said no every time. I went back to where I was staying, and he had found my Instagram, followed me, liked a bunch of my pictures, and sent me 3 DMs asking me to come to his hotel room. I did not respond.

The next day he apologized, and I decided to forgive him and move on. I still liked hanging out with him and the rest of the team and didn’t want to start any drama. I deeply cared about the job. He would text here and there, but never with anything sexual. I genuinely thought we had moved past it, and as months went on, our relationship felt extremely pleasant. Occasionally he would say something flirty or sweet, but I’d brush it off—it felt harmless. I became really good friends with another girl at work, and the three of us kind of became a unit. He would message me when he was heading to grab food so we could all have it as a group, and everything seemed completely normal. 

On the final day of my last trip, he messaged me at meals to see if I wanted to join him and, at the end of the night, even offered to help me transport some heavy things after he was already done with work (our job requires long hours). While we were walking, he asked about my relationship, and I told him that things were going much better. My partner and I were communicating better, he was home, and I felt better than ever about it.

I left, and everything seemed normal. He texted me while I was in the airport heading home and said things like, ""You should come hang out in \[where he lives\]"" and ""I would be so much happier if you and \[other friend\] both lived here."" Everything was super nice and normal feeling.

A few days later, he messaged me again, and when I asked how he was doing, he told me that he was dealing with some mental health stuff. He had gotten a bipolar diagnosis and was changing his medication to see if that would help. I sent him messages of support, and that was that.

A few days ago (about a week since we last texted), I received a shocking email from my bosses. Apparently, he had gone to his bosses, saying that I had been inappropriate with him. To quote directly, he stated that we were friends, but recently there was an incident where i had crossed the line and been inappropriate, and he was uncomfortable with me returning. And because of this, they were not going to have me return to the job. This shocked me to my core. I have never been accused of something like this, and I take it very seriously.

I have zero clue what incident he is even referring to, as the last time I was on a trip, we were never even alone together, except when he helped me carry stuff.

It’s apparent to me that the entire time he was attempting to manipulate me into cheating on my boyfriend and sleeping with him. It seems as though, when he realized this was no longer possible, in his mind, I became a bitch who must be destroyed.

He is attempting to ruin my relationship with my employers, my reputation by painting me as some kind of predator, my mental health, my finances, and has made me feel extremely violated. He has stolen a dream from me, and all I have done is be nice and supportive to him. The email from my bosses made it seem as though I was some kind of crazy person who is obsessed with him when this is not at all the truth (and I have the receipts to prove it). Just to add to the crazy, I recently saw that he sent me TikToks less than 24 hours before I received this email from my bosses. Meaning that he likely sent me those AFTER reporting me.

I have already responded to my bosses and said that I would like to have a Zoom call with them to explain my side of things and that the only one who ever behaved inappropriately was Paul.

My question is: what are my rights? Where the hell do I go from here? My dreams feel ruined, I’ve barely been able to eat or sleep. I feel so wronged and angry. I’m planning on writing a statement to read to my bosses and have all screenshots lined up and ready to show them.

**Update 1:*** firstly thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it. Especially people who also shared their stories, it means a lot and i’m so sorry. I think my post was a bit confusing (i’ll update it slightly for clarify)- in the email from my bosses they did inform me that “because i make him uncomfortable, they are taking me off the job”. This is only because he has more seniority and security at the company and is obviously bullshit. Second, tomorrow night i am meeting with an employment lawyer. i’ll let everyone know how that goes. Oh and i have screenshots of everything :) Thank you and KEEP RECEIPTS. 

**TLDR:** I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. A coworker made advances toward me, which I rejected. Despite this, we stayed friends, and everything seemed fine. Recently, he falsely accused me of being inappropriate with him, resulting in me being let go from my position. I’m shocked and devastated, as he’s ruined my dream job, reputation, financial stability, and mental health. I’m preparing to defend myself to my bosses, but I’m unsure of my next steps.",1723411084.0,WhamBamShazam123,TwoXChromosomes
"I (f25) just had sex with my boyfriend (m27) of 1 year, and for the first time in my life I stopped the sex once I was finished.","I’ve slept with 8 men in my life. Out of all of them, I’ve never really experienced a man that cared about my pleasure enough to make me finish every time - or at least try.
Usually, once he’s done - so is the sex.
I’ve tried all sorts over the course of 10 years to amend this. 

My current boyfriend of one year used to make a lot of effort in the beginning. However, as things got more comfortable so did he and the effort dwindled, despite me saying I needed it. I’ve always made the effort to help him finish. Sometimes I don’t mind if we had a quickie and it’s passionate. But other times The sex makes me feel awful if I feel like I’ve been used for a posh wank. I don’t want to beg to finish too. 

Today, I finally got mine. And it felt great. As soon as I finished, I rolled off, gave him a kiss on the cheek and said “thank you” like he has done to me.

It may sound petty.. because it was. I feel great. 

Sometimes actions speak louder than words. I’ve spoken about how it makes me feel if he doesn’t put the effort into making me cum. I love this man dearly. But I needed him to see how he made me feel. I’m proud of myself.

A lot of men I’ve experienced don’t seem to even be aware that we’re left frustrated and annoyed. It’s the equivalent of us getting you to the peak and then just not completing it. It’s so normal to them that they finish and women don’t. It’s not ok. 

For any men reading this and can’t help your partner finish - buy the satisfyer pro 2 and incorporate it. Your relationship will thank you.",1633263535.0,anon13ami,TwoXChromosomes

http://www.racked.com/2015/3/24/8266243/whitney-wolfe-tinder-bumble

I think the section below best summarizes the article and the goals behind the app:

> **How does Bumble give girls power?**

> That’s where the whole ""girls speak first"" aspect comes in. We wanted to modernize dating. I’ll go out with groups of my friends and someone will see a cute guy across the room, or in the bar, or in the restaurant. She’ll be like, ""Oh, he’s so cute, I wish I could talk to him!"" And then we all encourage her—""Go say hi, go send him a drink, go do something!""—and she never does. There’s this unwritten rule that it’s not ladylike, or it’s wrong, or the guy should go first. The whole thing feels silly and outdated! Women are extremely independent in every facet of our lives, except dating. We wanted to encourage a confident connection. Making the first move, whether a woman is matching with a man or a woman, gives her a boost of confidence right off the bat. It immediately puts her in the driver’s seat.

However, as a good friend would you offer any advice whether to continue the 'friends with benefit' relationship or to stop it from getting any further?

I just want my friend to be happy and not get hurt. Based on the stories I have heard, these kinds of relationship do not end well.

I agree with many of the answers that are suggesting that it is her choice and whether it does end badly or not, it is then that I can step in as a friend (if she ever asks for it). Also, considering the point that FWB can be better than one night stands.

Is there a right way to be encouraging of a woman in a male-dominated field/activity?,"So, I'm a Magic player, and there has been a [recent article](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/6-things-you-can-do-to-get-more-women-into-magic/) by competitive magic player Gaby Spartz that's been making waves in the Magic community in regards to sexism within our society. The game has been becoming steadily more popular, but it's still primarily male and occasionally misogynistic (even if its unintentional).

Most of the items mentioned within the article were pretty obvious, but I was surprised to find that I have been guilty of the first item in the past, and not specifically in regards to just Magic either. The first item refers to commenting (even if the comment is positive) when one discovers someone exploring territory not stereotypically associated with their class/gender/race/etc.

I've always hated stereotypes so there is little that makes me happier than seeing people daring to be different. As a result, I do my best to be encouraging whenever I encounter such a person because I know personally how frightening and uncomfortable that can be. Until I read this article, I thought I was doing a good thing, but it seems that might not be the case. Perhaps it's better to treat it like it's nothing.

Is there a right way to be encouraging of someone reaching across stereotypes, or is it better to simply behave like it's no big deal?",1428723549.0,RiverStrymon,AskWomen

________________________________________________________________________________________

Ok, I think from the comments it became clear, some people didn't quite understand the problem. This is not about me wanting my father to become the new instagram sensation, this is about him completely shutting down, when he has to replace old stuff that doesn't work anymore (!!! not for funsies) with new stuff.

He had to get a new car and a new stove and it seemed to be a really traumatic experience for him, because the car has a built in board computer and the stove's induction, he used to have a ceran one. It was simply impossible to get a car/stove that was simple enough for him, because they don't make them like that anymore and he was also specific about the brands. He starts to not do things anymore, that he used to enjoy, because he's protesting the new technology.

Also he does use a laptop for all of sorts of things he likes (e.g. following sports or reading news papers) and also works on a PC. He still is convinced, that they started the downfall of humanity and smart phones are the next stage of societal decay because they ""make people look stupid"".

[Trigger] Do you believe social media is encouraging disordered eating?,"Though it has always existed, ""Pro-Ana/Mia"" culture (where members encourage the development & cultivation of eating disorders, provide members with ""tips & tricks"" on concealing disordered eating from family members and health professionals, share photographs of ""Thinspo"" [individuals with extremely frail physiques, which often focusing on highlighting a particular feature, such as visible ribs, jutting shoulder blades, ""thigh gaps"", hip bones, predominant clavicles, or visible spinal bones], among other things) has gained visibility and accessibility with the growth in popularity of social media sites, particularly those which focus on image sharing, such as Tumblr and Instagram. 

Adolescents have always sought acceptance from their peers, attempting to ""fit in"" with certain cliques by mimicking their lifestyle, appearance, and mannerisms. Certain groups who once existed in a more ""underground"" fashion (such as the aforementioned Pro-Ana/Mia cultures, as well as individuals who self-harm via outside methods, such as cutting and burning) have become readily accessible with the advent of social media. Members are known to encourage ""one-upsmanship"" and often inspire competition between users to see who can most profoundly display the characteristics of their group: the more ""extreme"" the manifestation of a disorder, the better.

Do you believe these cultures have always existed in equal excess and are merely gaining visibility because of social media, or do you think individuals who are already vulnerable due to an unstable sense of self (namely teenagers and young adults) are latching on to them in an attempt to belong ? Do you have any personal experience with these cultures, whether it be before the advent of social media, after, or both?

"FAQ Q&A: ""What are, in your experience, the best and worst things about being a woman?""","Hello, AskWomen!

In a new post series over the next several weeks, we will be updating our sub's FAQ to include a great many topics that have lately been coming up with high frequency (and repetitive answers).  There will be one new topic per week, generally going up on Tuesdays (western hemisphere time) and coming down on Sundays.  

**These threads will be HEAVILY MODERATED.**  The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible.  If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What are, in your experience, the best and worst things about being a woman?**

Please especially keep in mind when answering this question or reading the responses of others:

* Trans women are welcome and encouraged to answer.  

* Nonbinary people and trans men who once were and/or currently are largely perceived as women may answer about that experience.

* While responses about the physical aspects of being AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth) are welcome, not all women have ovaries/a uterus/a vagina/boobs.

* Generalizations about men/other women should largely be understood to mean ""most people of this gender in my life.""  Blatant ""all men X"" and ""all women X"" statements as well as obvious parroting of trite stereotypes will still be removed per our rule against graceless generalizations.  

Thanks for contributing!

It is once again the time of year for the AskWomen Winter Holiday Megathread!,"🎄🕎☃️🎁🎅

During the Holiday Season, we generally see an *extremely* large uptick in holiday related questions/gift idea requests.  Shocking I know.  So we generally create a megathread for all winter holiday related questions.

As we've done for the past few years, given the many, many questions about Christmas gift ideas and in the interest of holiday cheer, we (the mods of /r/AskWomen) have decided to temporarily relax our rules and create a thread where anyone can get gift ideas.

For best results, give us a few details about the special people in your life, including age, your relationship to each other, length of relationship, and interests, as well as the price range you are looking for.  (shout out to /r/santashelpers as well)

Enjoy the thread everyone! Multiple submissions are encouraged. As are pictures of cats/dogs/iguanas etc. dressed as Santa/Reindeer/Yukon Cornelius/holiday adjacent costume of your choice.

All holiday posts will be redirected here so, everyone: please keep checking back on this post!  It will be sorted by NEW to encourage viewing of the newest questions/gift idea requests.",1511553461.0,Nillix,AskWomen
What are some good online communities that encourage conversation?,"Recently I've been thinking back to a few years ago when I was involved in a few facebook groups where people could bond over similar interests and after some time begin to talk more about other, offtopic things. I made some good friends in those groups. Another example was a video game community a friend of mine was a part of, where he made friends through the game and joined some group chats where members could talk about both the game and other unrelated interests. 

All of this has led me to want something like that again, as all of those previous groups/communities have since fallen apart and are no longer active. So my question is this - have any of you ever been a part of something like that? What online communities are you a part of that you might recommend?",1531271184.0,rosebud451,AskWomen

"As a transgender woman who is transitioning in her early 20s, what did I miss out on socialization-wise?","One thing I hear sometimes from ""trans-critical"" people is that trans women have various expectations, etc. as a result of being socialized male. I agree somewhat with this statement. As I'm an African American woman, a personal example is hair: for me when I was presenting as a boy, although I have the shared experience of hating my hair due to Eurocentric standards, I could just buzz cut it. Now I'm growing it out naturally, but deciding to do that wasn't anything special for me. But it's obviously a much bigger deal for cis women; I can remember some girls in grade school being teased for having natural hair, being called Buckwheat, country, nappy girl, etc. So for cis women who decide to transition from straightening their hair via relaxers to going natural, that act is a much bigger deal and is a definite statement.

So, for anyone who generally agrees that trans women and cis women have different socialization experiences, what do you think I (or trans women in general) missed out on? 

If you disagree, I would love to hear your remarks as well :) I can see, for example, that trans women who were socialized as female from pre-puberty would have a much closer experience to cis women. In my hair example, I can imagine a black trans woman who was encouraged to straighten her hair when she transitioned would have that same feeling of empowerment if she decided to go natural.

There are of course reproductive-related things I'm not going to experience like periods (and that really makes me sad for obvious reasons), but I'm just looking at the social effects of being socialized as male vs. female throughout childhood and teenage years.",1377883862.0,JumpOnRed,AskWomen
How would one non-violently put a woman in her place who's hit a man?,"I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about this and we both agreed that its not okay for women to legitimately hit men in order to cause them pain (obviously its not okay for anyone to hit anyone, regardless of gender). 

We also both disagreed with the common (at least common in guys that we've both talked to in real life) notion that if a woman hits a man it's then okay for the man to hit her back. It's fine for him to restrain her/protect himself from getting hurt further, but it doesn't give him license to punch her in the face (some guys I know actually believe that this is okay).

Any woman that thinks it's somehow acceptable to hit a guy (unless in self defense) and thinks it's a show of strength and empowerment needs to be made to understand that it's highly inappropriate and is actually a show of immaturity and entitlement. 

What do you all think would be an appropriate way for a guy who has been hit by a girl to make her understand that its definitely NOT okay (without hitting her back of course)?

EDIT: I didn't mean to offend anyone with the wording ""put in her place"". I wasn't referring to the ""place of a woman"", as that obviously has an offensive connotation, I was going for more along the lines of ""learn a lesson"" and understand that her behavior is inappropriate and should not be repeated.

Thoughts on cuddling? Outside your significant other?,"Too long didn't attempt to read: I'm a male asexual college student who likes cuddling. It's hard to find people to cuddle with. What could I do to make you, specifically, comfortable enough with me to cuddle (and nothing else), assuming cuddling could be somewhere eventually maybe on the table?


So I'm a college student, male, not interested in sex (I mean really not interested, I had to teach myself what sexy means the same way most people have to teach themselves a second language, and my entire life it has seemed just, well, unsanitary), but I have found out in the last years that I really enjoy cuddling with people. It turns out that there have been very few guys comfortable enough to cuddle, though I've found a few. Most of my cuddle friends have been college aged girls. Coincidentally, most of my friends who are college aged girls are starting to find themselves people they want to do more than cuddle with. This is the crux.

Please understand I have no problem with this by itself, I like my friends and want them to be happy, and I hope to find someone myself eventually (but again a long hug is basically my second base, which lowers the potential pool pretty dramatically). But it presents an interesting question, or five. Are you comfortable being snuggly with someone, knowing there's nothing else behind it and never will be? And now imagine you have someone else waiting for you, who's not this person you're touching now, who cares about you in an entirely different possibly more primal way - is that still alright?

If you could tell me a bit about where you come from, culturally or temporally or philosophically, that'd be great also (people willing to discuss philosophy of cuddling with me or other important-but-annoyingly-avoided-in-polite-conversation topics like that tend to become my friends. I am the kind of person who likes being around excited people, and especially in college they actually are exactly those sorts of people), and especially please tell me if you've known a cuddler who dealt with their own unique issues, from any side of this. I've just moved halfway around the world and lost the human blankets I relied on, but there are enough people in college that I'm bound to run into shiny new snuggies soon enough. 

Still. Opinions would be mightily appreciated. Is there something that makes this whole business unfeasible, especially for the version of you who is going to college? Would you even believe me at first (I don't think I would believe me at first); and is there something I could do to make it clear I am honestly paying attention to you for reasons besides bodily fluids? (I mean besides the pseudo-obvious 'treat you like a person', which I try to do; this is more about what would make you comfortable in a situation like this, short and long-term (specifically *you*, I'm not asking for a magic posture that will make all women trust me)) Would a shirt like the one below come off as trying too hard?
http://www.zazzle.co.uk/i_would_cuddle_you_so_hard_tshirt-235415987657307544

 A shirt like that, could be taken as ironic, lying, honest, or pathetically needy, depending on the person reading it. But if I can't be honest at the simplest level about what I want, because it will be interpreted through the connotations left by my satyriatic peers and mixed into the boiling pot of social empowerment and politically-correct well-meaning confusion that is postmodern life - well, touching somebody is a lot more complex than it used to be, and I'd like to try to peel this onion far down enough that everyone stops internally tearing up about it, if you don't mind my mixtended metaphors.

Is straight sex really so disappointing for women?,"I apologize if this sounds rude, I really don't mean it to be. 

I'm a lesbian, and I have very few heterosexual friends that are female. Therefore, I don't know much about straight sex from the woman's perspective. What I do hear/read about straight sex makes it seem like the common process is the man pumps & cums and the woman... Doesn't. And then it ends. I have this idea that most straight men do not care about their partner's sexual pleasure, and that straight women rarely orgasm during sex. 

I imagine this is only my perception because the only stories I hear about straight sex are the bad sessions/partners. Is this how most sessions go, or am I only hearing the bad ones? Do the women even consider my perception of straight sex ""bad""?

I'm sorry my wording is a bit messy. I'm hoping my question is understandable and I don't sound like a jerk!",1533693580.0,Typheus432,AskWomen
